The '''{{nihongo|Abandon Pond|置いてけ堀|Oiteke-bori}}''' is a pond variously located both near the [[Forest of Magic]] and on the outskirts of the [[Human Village]].

==Background Information==
In folklore, the Abandon Pond is one of the [http://hyakumonogatari.com/2012/01/02/the-seven-wonders-of-honjo/ Seven Wonders of Honjo], a collection of ghost stories set in an area of [[wikipedia:Edo|Edo]], or old Tokyo. It is said that on certain days, fish come in abundance. However, as the last fisherman of that day try to leave, a mysterious voice calls for them to "abandon it..." If they try to run, their feet become heavy. Whether they empty their sack by choice, their catch is taken from them, or they only try to put back a little, it will completely disappear and they will leave empty-handed, no matter what.

==Story==
;''Forbidden Scrollery''
Here, it is located near the [[Forest of Magic]], with signs of caution posted, indicating it as a youkai-infested area. [[Ice Scale]]s were found here by [[Marisa Kirisame]], only for a strange voice to call out, telling her to abandon the scales and leave, though she escaped with them.

This is tied into a story by [[Kosuzu Motoori]] about stalking wooden clappers and ghostly lanterns wandering about the [[Human Village]]. Later, Akyuu tells her about the sound of belly-drumming Tanuki. The two conclude it must be someone using the Seven Wonders of Honjo as camouflage to scare humans away.

Next, Kosuzu leads Reimu to an abandoned building on the outskirts of the Village nicknamed the Foot-Washing House, another of the Seven Wonders. After sending Kosuzu home, Reimu lies in wait for the culprits of the affair: the kappa. They explain that the Abandon Pond is just one of their warehouses, along with the Foot-Washing House, which they rely on when the Abandon Pond freezes over.

;''Wild and Horned Hermit''
After discovering the seal, [[Minor Characters#Manzairaku|Manzairaku]], at the [[Genbu Ravine]], the kappa relocate it to the Abandon Pond and set up an attraction that proves popular with visitors.

;''Urban Legend in Limbo''
In ''[[Urban Legend in Limbo]]'', the pond is said to be located on the edge of the [[Human Village]], instead, where it is shrouded in mist. Nitori sets up stalls accompanying a [[Minor Characters#Nessie|Nessie]] attraction after [[Mamizou Futatsuiwa]] tells her that the real thing has been following her around, though Nitori wishes she had realized it herself. Because the monster cannot be seen clearly, less people are actually scared of it, turning it into another profitable venture for the kappa.

==General Information== 
The {{nihongo|'''Animal Realm'''|畜生界|Chikushoukai}} is a loosely-defined region of [[Hell]] (often treated as a separate neighboring realm) that is inhabited by countless animal spirits. As befits a realm related to Hell, the Animal Realm is a harsh place ruled by survival of the fittest, and human spirits are enslaved on the lowest rung of the animals' hierarchy.

While not directly connected to Gensokyo, it's possible to travel between the two by passing through greater [[Hell]]. The presence of border guards in Hell makes this difficult except during extenuating circumstances, however.

===Basis===
The Animal Realm is loosely based on the [[wikipedia:Desire_realm|Tiryagyoni desire realm]] (畜生界, ''Chikushoukai'') in real-world Buddhist cosmology, from where the in-universe location takes its name. In real-world Buddhist cosmology, the Tiryagyoni realm is the state of existence inhabited by non-human animals on Earth, and is distinct from the "Hell realm" of [[wikipedia:Naraka_(Buddhism)|Naraka]].

==Background Information== 

===Geography and People===
The majority of the Animal Realm is a skyscraper-filled metropolis, with one remaining forested region known as the [[Primate Spirit Garden]] where the human spirits are kept. The Garden is surrounded by a swamp, with its central island bearing a strong resemblance to the real-world [[wikipedia:Mozu_Tombs|Daisenryou Kofun]], and is treated as a recreational area by the realm's animal inhabitants. During the events of ''[[Wily Beast and Weakest Creature]]'', a high-tech fortress was built in the middle of the garden by [[Keiki Haniyasushin]], but it may have been destroyed after her defeat.

The Animal Realm is ruled by four [[wikipedia:Yakuza|yakuza]]-esque gangs: [[Saki Kurokoma]]'s Keiga Family, characterized by strength and brute force, [[Yachie Kicchou]]'s Kiketsu Family, characterized by underhanded attacks from the shadows, [[Yuuma Toutetsu]]'s Gouyoku Alliance, characterized by aerial warfare, and a fourth unnamed organization which specializes in cowardly methods of attack such as traps, camouflage, and parasitism. It's said that survival in the Animal Realm practically necessitates working for one of these gangs.

===Names of the Groups===
The name of Yachie's family, the ''Kiketsu'' (鬼傑), roughly translates to "relentless excellence". 

The name of Saki's family, the ''Keiga'' (勁牙), translates to "strong fang". The character 勁 ''kei'' ("strong" or "agile") also appears in the prefix of most of her Spell Cards.

The first part of Yuuma's alliance's name, ''Gouyoku'' (剛欲), roughly translates to "obstinate avarice". It shares its pronunciation with the deadly sin of Greed (強欲). This name is also present in the title of ''[[Touhou Gouyoku Ibun]]''.

==Animal Realm's Appearences== 
===Games===
;Wily Beast and Weakest Creature
During the events of ''[[Wily Beast and Weakest Creature]]'', the collective faith of the Animal Realm's human spirits summoned [[Keiki Haniyasushin]], who took over the Primate Spirit Garden in the name of liberating the human spirits. She was aided in this effort by an army of [[wikipedia:Haniwa|haniwa]] soldiers (including [[Mayumi Joutouguu]]) that she created, which had no innate spiritual qualities and thus could not be harmed by the animal spirits. The animal spirits responded by taking advantage of [[Hell]]'s current political turmoil to secretly travel to [[Gensokyo]] and enlist the help of the protagonist-- either [[Reimu Hakurei]], [[Marisa Kirisame]] or [[Youmu Konpaku]]-- under false pretenses, followed by the protagonist successfully defeating Keiki (albeit without fully understanding what was going on).

Following Keiki's defeat, the Animal Realm returned to business as usual. Shortly thereafter, [[Saki Kurokoma]] attempted to invade Gensokyo herself, and was defeated by the protagonist.

The {{nihongo|'''Bamboo Forest of the Lost'''|迷いの竹林|Mayoi no Chikurin}} is said to be located in the opposite direction to the [[Youkai Mountain]] when looking out from the [[Human Village]]. Legend has it that the forest was not originally a part of [[Gensokyo]], but was washed over to Gensokyo by a big tsunami. Long long ago, the forest was known as {{nihongo|Takakusa Commandery|高草郡|Takakusa Gun|literally "Tall Grass Commandery", an abolished administrative region in Inaba province in real life, now Tottori prefecture}}.&lt;ref&gt;[[Strange and Bright Nature Deity]] Chapter 3. The fairies and Reisen discuss the history of the forest.&lt;/ref&gt; Inside of it lies the mansion [[Eientei]].

Given the nature of the forest, it is very easy to get lost. There are no clearings, the ground is mostly flat &amp; indistinguishable and the bamboos grow quickly resulting in a constant change of scenery.

[[Fujiwara no Mokou]] lives here assisting any people who get lost, while [[Tewi Inaba]] and other [[rabbit]]s can be seen wandering in the forest.

==The Bamboo Forest's Appearances==
===Games===
;Imperishable Night
The forest was first shown in [[stage]] 4 of ''[[Imperishable Night]]'', where the [[boss]] of the stage is either [[Reimu Hakurei]] or [[Marisa Kirisame]]. After a misunderstanding in stage 3 at the [[Human Village]], [[Keine Kamishirasawa]] will point the heroine to the forest as where the source of the incident is. When facing either Reimu or Marisa, they'll fight them whilst cutting through the forest rather aimlessly. Once defeating the boss, the heroine will find [[Eientei]] hidden deep within the forest. On the Extra stage about a month later, [[Kaguya Houraisan]] sent the heroine here again to fight [[Fujiwara no Mokou]] as [[assassin]]s, only without them knowing. After fighting brutal [[Fairy|fairies]], they'll encounter Keine as a [[Therianthrope|were]]-[[hakutaku]] before facing Mokou herself.

;Phantasmagoria of Flower View
The location once appeared as a stage in ''[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]'', dedicated to Reimu, Marisa and [[Tewi Inaba]]. Many characters come to this place during the game looking for leads towards the flower incident, where the stage appears in many scenarios, encountering one of three said characters. In [[Eiki Shiki, Yamaxanadu]]'s scenario, she'll come here to see on two separate occasions to see if Marisa and Tewi have been keeping up with what they (were supposed to have) learnt from the [[yama]], which they haven't.

;Double Dealing Character
The forest once again makes a return in stage 3 of ''[[Double Dealing Character]]'', where the heroine will encounter [[Kagerou Imaizumi]] as the stage [[boss]]. The heroine comes here after visiting [[Canal of Willows]] only to find more vicious [[youkai]]. After fighting Kagerou, they'll fly upwards to the skies of [[Gensokyo]] within a storm.

===Spin-offs===
The forest made an appearance as stage in ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]'', making it a location for many characters to fight. If one connects ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]'' to SWR, then the stage can be selected in that game too.

;''Impossible Spell Card''
The bamboo forest appears on the third day of ''[[Impossible Spell Card]]'', where [[Seija Kijin]] carries on defending herself from other [[youkai]] who are trying to capture her. It is here that she learnt that she'll be facing [[spell card]]s that are considered impossible to dodge. She'll fight against [[Kagerou Imaizumi]], [[Keine Kamishirasawa]] and [[Fujiwara no Mokou]] as they try to capture her with their "impossible" [[spell card]]s. On Scene 1 when she'll face Kagerou, she learns that the task to catching her has spread, and she also learns to use the cheating item "[[Bloodthirsty Yin-Yang Orb]]". There are 7 scenes total in the day. The previous day was at the [[Myouren Temple]], whilst the next day is located at the [[Myouren Temple Cemetery]].

;''Urban Legend in Limbo''
The forest was added as a [[stage]] location in ''[[Urban Legend in Limbo]]'', associating it with [[Fujiwara no Mokou]]. Some scenarios will show the player character coming across Mokou here. On [[Sumireko Usami]]'s scenario, after she encountered Mokou and defeated her, Mokou kindly guided Sumireko out of the forest.

The {{nihongo|'''Barrier of Life &amp; Death'''|幽明結界|Yūmei Kekkai}} is the [[boundary]] between [[Gensokyo]] and the [[Netherworld]]. Not much is known about the place.

==General Information==
The barrier itself is a giant door with four wooden pillars emerging from the clouds. Ever since the events of ''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]'', the barrier has been weak because [[Yuyuko Saigyouji]] broke it to allow spring into the [[Netherworld]]. Thus, it is rather easy to enter the Netherworld, especially if you can fly. All you'd have to do is fly over the door, since it's locked. [[Yukari Yakumo]] was supposed to fix the barrier, but she never got around to it. However, this also means that [[phantom]]s can also leak into Gensokyo. According to [[Sakuya Izayoi]]'s scenario of the said game, the location of the barrier is apparently not far from the [[Hakurei Shrine]]; on [[stage]] 3 after defeating [[Alice Margatroid]], she says to go "upwind" in order to get to the barrier above the clouds, but going "downwind" will lead to the shrine.

The kanji {{lang|ja|幽明}} does not have a clear meaning, but generally it refers to the {{nihongo|afterlife|幽|Yuu|faint/dark/ghostly}} and the {{nihongo|mortal world|明|mei|light/bright, etc.}}. Therefore, a literal translation would be "The mortal realm and afterlife". Also, the kanji appears in [[Youmu Konpaku]]'s [[spell card]]s {{nihongo|''Soul Sign "Wheel of Pain of the Living and Dead"''|魂符「'''幽明'''の苦輪」}} and {{nihongo|''Konpaku "Dharma of Gumonji Wisdom of the Living and Dead"''|魂魄「'''幽明'''求聞持聡明の法」}}.

==The Barrier's Appearances==
;''Perfect Cherry Blossom''
After the heroines flied through most of [[Stage]] 4 above the clouds, they'll end up at this barrier. After waiting, the [[Prismriver Sisters]] will show up and said that they were invited to a flower-viewing at the [[Netherworld]]. However instead, they fight the heroine, only to be defeated. After they were defeated, the heroine will then fly over the barrier and head towards Stage 5 onto [[Hakugyokurou]]'s Stairway, or in [[Reimu Hakurei]]'s case, she'll destroy the barrier. The weakness of the barrier allowed [[phantom]]s to come to [[Gensokyo]], thus causing the events of the Extra and Phantasm stages of the game. The heroines had to go out to try and find [[Yukari Yakumo]] to fix the barrier, but she never did.

;''Phantasmagoria of Flower View''
The Barrier of Life &amp; Death appeared as a [[stage]] location in ''[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]'', in which the [[Prismriver Sisters]] are dedicated to this location, specifically [[Lunasa Prismriver]], [[Merlin Prismriver]] and [[Lyrica Prismriver]]. It is mostly dedicated to Lyrica because she is not with her sisters. The location is generally dedicated to stages 2, 3 or 4, but may appear as stage 1 on [[Medicine Melancholy]]'s scenario and it doesn't appear [[Komachi Onozuka]]'s scenario. Various characters will come here to look for leads towards the flower incident (even though flowers don't grow here), only to find and defeat Lyrica.

The {{nihongo|'''Canal of Willows'''|柳の運河|Yanagi no Unga}} is a canal near the [[Human Village]], where willow trees can be found. It is presented as a vaguely ominous location, though in actuality, the heroine seems genuinely surprised to find that there are actually [[youkai]] running rampant there after so many years, implying that it is supposedly intended to be peaceful. 

==General Information==
As the name implies, it is a water canal strewn with willows, and due to its close proximity to the [[Human Village]], as well as the in-game assumption that rampaging youkai wouldn't be near it, it can be safely assumed that it serves a regular purpose for the village and that [[human]]s visit it frequently. In spite of the heroines' assumptions, however, [[Sekibanki]] implies that several youkai do in fact come to the canal as well, and that like herself, some even reside in the Human Village, presenting themselves as humans. The title of ''[[Double Dealing Character]]'' Stage 2's theme song, "Humans and Youkai, Coming and Going at the Canal", seems to corroborate this assertion.

Sekibanki herself, of course, can also be found roaming about here now and then. [[Marisa Kirisame]] does also state that "the seats under the the willows" have a reputation as being the homes of [[phantom]]s.

==Canal of Willows's Appearances==
===Games===
;''Double Dealing Character''
In ''[[Double Dealing Character]]'', the canal was used as the location for Stage 2. The heroine continues to investigate the rampaging youkai after coming from the [[Misty Lake]], and is surprised to find them so close to the village. An irritable Sekibanki then approaches, seeming miffed that humans are getting "big heads" lately because the youkai have been quiet for a while, and attacks. However, she's quick to second-guess her attempts when it turns out that the heroine was far more powerful than she expected. After here, the heroine will travel to the [[Bamboo Forest of the Lost]] on Stage 3.

The {{nihongo|'''Deep Road to Hell'''|地獄の深道|Jigoku no fukadō}} is a gloomy hole that continues from the [[Fantastic Blowhole]] that leads further into the [[Underworld]], where the next layer after here is the [[Former Capital]] in [[Former Hell]]. Apart from the known fact that [[Parsee Mizuhashi]], the bridge princess, is known to lurk around here, there is not much known about this place, nor is its location in [[Gensokyo]] as a whole. Parsee describes this place as an "underground skyscraper". A bridge is known to be located here, as both described in-game and shown on ''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'' Chapter 2.

==Blowhole's Appearances==
===Games===
;''Subterranean Animism''
The road first appeared on [[Stage]] 2 in ''[[Subterranean Animism]]''. After going through the [[Fantastic Blowhole]], [[Reimu Hakurei]] or [[Marisa Kirisame]] will continue to fly through here, fighting various [[Fairy|fairies]] and [[flying yin-yangs]]. [[Parsee Mizuhashi]] is the midboss and [[boss]] of the stage, and she attacks because she is easily jealous. The heroine will defeat her and continue to travel to the [[Former Capital]] in [[Former Hell]], going deeper into the [[Underworld]].

===Spin-offs===
;''Double Spoiler''
The road appears in ''[[Double Spoiler]]'' on [[stage]] 2, where [[Aya Shameimaru]] and [[Hatate Himekaidou]] encounters [[Parsee Mizuhashi]] and [[Hina Kagiyama]] to try and take photos of their [[danmaku]]. It is not explained why Hina is lurking around this area. The previous stage is at the Foot of the [[Youkai Mountain]] (the same one from ''[[Mountain of Faith]]'', whilst the next stage is at the [[Fantastic Blowhole]] back in the [[Underworld]]. There are 6 scenes total on this stage.

The {{nihongo|'''Dream World'''|夢の世界|Yume no Sekai}} is a world that is visited via dreaming and is ruled by [[Doremy Sweet]].

==General Information==
The Dream World is normally accessed via dreams, where the dreamer exists as their "dream self".

In ''[[Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom]]'', the Dream World is mysteriously accessed physically through a secret passageway that [[Reisen Udongein Inaba]] calls "{{nihongo|Kaian Passageway #4|第四槐安通路}}", and is said to be used as a method of travel between the [[Lunar Capital]] and [[Gensokyo]] by the [[moon rabbit]]s&lt;ref&gt;[[Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom/Story/Reisen's Scenario#Stage 3]]&lt;/ref&gt;. The passageway seems to resemble outer space somewhat, as [[Sanae Kochiya]] exclaims "I'm flying through space!", and both the Moon and the Earth are visible, seen in Stage 3 and the Extra Stage respectively.

There is no information suggesting the {{nihongo|[[Fantasy World]]|夢幻世界}} in ''[[Lotus Land Story]]'', the {{nihongo|[[World of Fantasies]]|幻夢界}} in ''[[Story of Eastern Wonderland]]'', or [[Unnamed Dream World|Mugetsu's world]], are at all related.

==Appearances==
;''Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom''
Prior to the game's events, ordered by [[Sagume Kishin]], [[Doremy Sweet]] creates a fake [[Lunar Capital]] within the Dream World that the residents of the Lunar Capital temporarily live in while the Hell [[fairies]] run rampant on the Moon.

After [[Ringo]]'s defeat, she tells the heroine to go through the secret passageway in the Dream World to get to the [[Lunar Capital]]. They are stopped by Doremy, who is surprised to find they are in their physical body while in a dream, and ultimately allows them to get the true Lunar Capital instead of the fake one, contrary to Sagume's instruction.

;''Antinomy of Common Flowers''
The "Perfect Possession" phenomenon is affecting the Dream World and its inhabitants are being expelled into the real world. When someone is being perfectly possessed, their partner remains in the Dream World. Also because of this phenomenon, [[Sumireko Usami]] is stuck in the Dream World while her dream self is rampaging in the real world. There, she encounters the dream versions of [[Reimu Hakurei]] and [[Marisa Kirisame]] and interact with [[Doremy Sweet]] who was keeping an eye on her. She is finally freed from the dream world by [[Yukari Yakumo]], who was trying to put a stop to the rampage of Sumireko's dream self.

;''Violet Detector''
The whole premise of [[Violet Detector]] happens in the Dream World. The dream dwellers are ganging up against [[Sumireko Usami]]'s dream self, jealous that one of them is able to have a flesh in the real world.

==Additional Information==
*In ''[[Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom]]'', there appears to be [[flying yin-yangs]] and [[Makai]]-types of [[Fairy|fairies]] and [[Sunflower Fairy|sunflower fairies]] also flying around this world. [[ZUN]] states that these are "just things in each dream," but are still mischievous of them to spread barrages of [[danmaku]] despite being in a dream.
*It is the third time a sort of dream world was used as the [[stage]] 3 of a particular game, the other two coming from ''[[Lotus Land Story]]'' and ''[[Story of Eastern Wonderland]]''.

{{nihongo|'''Eientei'''|永遠亭|lit. "House of Eternity"}} is the name of a large, old-fashioned Japanese mansion hidden deep within the [[Bamboo Forest of the Lost]]. It has hallways that lead out into the far reaches of the sky. It was created by [[Eirin Yagokoro]] for [[Kaguya Houraisan]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Cage in Lunatic Runagate/First Chapter|Cage in Lunatic Runagate Chapter 1]] "Deep within that forest I prepared a special mansion for the princess where no one could easily come across it. That is this place, Eientei."&lt;/ref&gt;

==General Information==
Eientei is currently occupied by a large group. [[Kaguya Houraisan]] and [[Eirin Yagokoro]] have been hiding there since their exile from the [[Moon]]. Other occupants include [[rabbit]]s, lots of them, all under the command of [[Tewi Inaba]] and [[Reisen Udongein Inaba]], who protect Kaguya and Eirin from intruders.

It is unknown to the majority of Gensokyo that the residents of Eientei are from the moon.&lt;ref&gt;[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]] Eirin, Kaguya, and Reisen's entire articles. Also, [[Curiosities of Lotus Asia/Chapter_23|Curiosities of Lotus Asia Chapter 23]]. "the bamboo forest physician is likely an intellectual that started their practice here after lamenting over the condition of medical care in Gensokyo. She may even be from the outside world."&lt;/ref&gt; Eientei's residents&lt;ref&gt;{{BAiJR|Page|Kaguya}} Kaguya: "Regarding the Lunarians descending to the surface, does it matter if it really happened?" Aya: "To begin, the part where I felt was kind of fake wasn't that....Um, was that fake?"&lt;/ref&gt; and the few nonresidents who do know are keeping it a secret.&lt;ref&gt;{{PMiSS|Page|Reimu Hakurei}} "Although she claims that she also solved this incident, if one asks her about the cause or the perpetrator, she'll only respond with ambiguous answers."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Youkai]] are apparently aware that Reisen is from the [[Moon]] (who proclaims it)&lt;ref&gt;{{BAiJR|Page|Reisen}} "(Moon Rabbit. Self-proclaimed) and [[Touhou Hisoutensoku/Translation/Suwako%27s_Script|Touhou Hisoutensoku Suwako's Victory quote to Reisen]] "I heard that there are all kinds of gods where you come from."&lt;/ref&gt;, but the [[human]]s from the [[Human Village]] may not be.&lt;ref&gt;{{PMiSS|Page|Reisen Udongein Inaba}} (entire article)&lt;/ref&gt; The average human and youkai know Kaguya as the princess of Eientei and its mistress.

Every month on the night of the full moon, the residents of Eientei hold a {{nihongo|Moon Festival|例月祭|Reigetsusai}}, offering mochi with medicinal herbs pounded into them. Making mochi is thus the main occupation of the Earth rabbits. Eientei has also hosted a lunar expo at least twice, showcasing objects from the Moon. Items include the American flag placed on the moon (confiscated from the [[Three Fairies of Light]]),&lt;ref&gt;As seen in [[Eastern and Little Nature Deity]] Chapter 3 and [[Silent Sinner in Blue]] [[:File:SSIBCH2USAFlag.jpg|Chapter 2]].&lt;/ref&gt; moon rocks, an ox cart used to be able to fly long ago (but now is pulled by an actual ox), a kimono that shines, a lunar rover and many other relics.&lt;ref&gt;{{BAiJR|Page|Kaguya}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both [[human]]s and [[youkai]] may come to Eientei for Eirin's medical services. [[Fujiwara no Mokou]] often provides escort through the [[Bamboo Forest of the Lost]]. In [[Alternative Facts in Eastern Utopia]], Eientei group's service providing medicines is called "Hourai Pharmacy".

==Eientei's Appearances==
===Windows===
;''Imperishable Night''
Eientei is where the incident of ''[[Imperishable Night]]'' is coming from. It is the [[stage]] location for stage 5, 6A and 6B. After the heroines fly through the [[Bamboo Forest of the Lost]] fighting either [[Reimu Hakurei]] or [[Marisa Kirisame]], they find Eientei. After invading the building down a long corridor, they encounter [[Eirin Yagokoro]], who is the one that replaced the [[Moon]] with a fake one to try and hide the "princess", [[Kaguya Houraisan]]. She gets [[Reisen Udongein Inaba]] to fight the heroines, but fail. They're then given a choice to go though the correct door: if they go the wrong way, they'll face Eirin with the fake moon, but go trough the correct door that wasn't sealed correctly, they'll face Kaguya with the real Moon. One they're defeated, the Moon is finally put back in its place.

;''Phantasmagoria of Flower View''
Eientei is a stage location in ''[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]'', dedicated to [[Reisen Udongein Inaba]]. Various characters in the game will come here and wander through a hallway, wondering why there are so many flowers blooming. They'll also face Reisen, only to defeat her. In [[Eiki Shiki, Yamaxanadu]]'s scenario, she'll come here to see if Reisen has been keeping up with what she (supposed to have) learnt by the [[yama]].

;''Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom''
Eientei is presented in the [[Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom/Story/Prologue|prologue]] of ''[[Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom]]''. [[Eirin Yagokoro]] and [[Kaguya Houraisan]] are discussing on what to do about the [[moon rabbit]]s coming to [[Gensokyo]] and [[Purity|purifying]] the Earth. Eirin states that she made a medicine that'll help see the heroine the future, helping them to defeat the enemy. She gives them to [[Reisen Udongein Inaba]] to have her give them to the heroines.

;''Urban Legend in Limbo (PlayStation 4)''
Eientei appears in ''[[Urban Legend in Limbo]]'' as a stage exclusive to the PS4 version of the game as the stage of [[Reisen Udongein Inaba]].

The {{nihongo|'''Fantastic Blowhole'''|幻想風穴|Gensō Kazaana}} is a gloomy cave that leads further into the [[Underworld]], where the next layer after here is the [[Deep Road to Hell]]. Apart from the known fact that [[Kisume]] and [[Yamame Kurodani]] are known to lurk around here, there is not much known about this place, nor is its location in [[Gensokyo]]. Apparently, the hole is soaking wet, and the wind that comes through here is strong. [[Rock]]s are also known to tumble down here.

==Blowhole's Appearances==
===Games===
;''Subterranean Animism''
The Blowhole first appeared on [[Stage]] 1 in ''[[Subterranean Animism]]'', where [[Reimu Hakurei]] or [[Marisa Kirisame]] will fly through here, fighting various [[Fairy|fairies]] and [[Sunflower Fairy|sunflower fairies]], but also destroying various [[rock]]s that fall down on them. [[Kisume]] is the midboss, and [[Yamame Kurodani]] is the [[boss]] of the stage. The heroine will defeat these two with little reason, since it made Yamame think that the heroine was talking to themselves, but they were actually talking to a [[youkai]] from above ground via communication. The heroine will travel to the [[Deep Road to Hell]] after here, going deeper into the [[Underworld]].

===Spin-offs===
;''Double Spoiler''
The hole appears in ''[[Double Spoiler]]'' on [[stage]] 3, where [[Aya Shameimaru]] and [[Hatate Himekaidou]] encounters [[Yamame Kurodani]], [[Kogasa Tatara]] and [[Kisume]] to try and take photos of their [[danmaku]]. It is not explained why Kogasa is lurking around this area. The previous stage is at the [[Deep Road to Hell]], whilst the next stage is at the [[Untrodden Valley]] on the [[Youkai Mountain]]. There are 8 scenes total on this stage.

The {{nihongo|'''Fantasy World'''|夢幻世界|Mugen Sekai}} is an intermediary world that only appears on [[stage]] 3 of and ''[[Lotus Land Story]]''. There is little information of this place.

==General Information==
The world is known to be under the [[Lake of Blood]], itself on a mountain behind the [[Hakurei Shrine]]. The place appears to have unusual, non-[[humanoid]] creatures, such as [[Evil Eye]]s and [[Electric orb]]s. The entrance has a red background that looks like rocks and further on there's darkness in resemblance to outer space. There are floating blue tiles making the shape of a pixelated diamond and various coloured small stars. Despite its space appearance, it's still possible to breathe. At the end of the world, there is [[Mugenkan]] that lies on the boundary of [[Gensokyo]] and the Fantasy World, a mansion owned by [[Yuuka Kazami]] and guarded by [[Elly]].

==Appearance==
;''Lotus Land Story''
In ''[[Lotus Land Story]]'', [[Reimu Hakurei]] and [[Marisa Kirisame]] pass through here to get to [[Mugenkan]] after defeating [[Kurumi]], where they meet [[Elly]] and [[Yuuka Kazami]].

The {{nihongo|'''Forest of Magic'''|魔法の森|Mahou no Mori}} is location name in [[Gensokyo]] that's a focal point for all things evil, ominous and repulsive, located not far from the [[Human Village]]. It's the home to both [[Marisa Kirisame]] and [[Alice Margatroid]].

==General Information==
Since [[Gensokyo]] isn't a huge place, if you say {{nihongo|"forest"|森|Mori}}, it refers to the Forest of Magic. It's called the "Forest of Magic" because of the wide number of hallucinogenic mushrooms that grow here. Many magicians live in this forest for the sake of increasing their magical powers with these hallucinogenic mushrooms. The forest has areas of ground where the sun never shines, thus making them dark and damp for mushrooms to endlessly grow there. 

It's a place whose true nature is clouded by strange rumours and weird happenstance. The forest's environment is extremely hazardous to both [[human]]s and [[youkai]] and both kinds typically also find the place uncomfortable. The spores of monstrous mushrooms dance about in mid-air and a normal human's health would worsen simply by breathing here, putting aside the [[human]]-eating plants and inevitable, horrible misfortune that will surely befall all who even think of trespassing into the forest. However, if one could stand the noxious gases that the monstrous mushrooms emit, then it would be both a safe and secretive place to seclude oneself, or a fairly nice place to live for people who don't like to be disturbed. 

===Geography &amp; People===
[[Marisa Kirisame|Marisa]] and [[Alice Margatroid|Alice]]'s houses are located somewhere within the forest near to each other. Near both their houses is the tree where the [[Three Fairies of Light]] used to live, but they have now moved behind the [[Hakurei Shrine]]. Rounding out the main attractions is [[Kourindou]], [[Rinnosuke Morichika]]'s shop of odds and ends (including many objects from the [[outside world]]), which is found on the very border of the forest itself.

In ''[[Oriental Sacred Place]]'' Chapter 10, a radio tower that appeared in the forest from the outside world was converted into a fairy shrine by the [[Three Fairies of Light]].

In ''[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]]'', it is known that the forest is one of [[Mamizou Futatsuiwa]]'s and [[Shizuha Aki]]'s main places of activity.

===Marisa's House===
:[[Marisa Kirisame]] has her own home located in the forest that's used as her storage and filled with dangerous items and generally odd things due to Marisa's mania for collecting. Apparently her house doubles as the "Kirisame Magic Shop", which doesn't have many customers due to its location.

:It's unknown how Marisa got her home, but she tells [[Tenshi Hinanawi]] that her "house wasn't built for earthquakes" and says in her ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]'' ending that if her house is destroyed, she can always build a new one. There doesn't seem to be anything particularly special about her house and she was probably around when it was originally built. At the time of ''[[Curiosities of Lotus Asia]]'' [[Curiosities of Lotus Asia/Chapter 07|Chapter 7]], it was still new enough that Marisa referred to it as "my new house", at least in comparison to living with her parents.

===Alice's House===
:[[Alice Margatroid]] also has her own home located in the in the forest filled with dolls. It's a white European-style building that's small in size. It's unknown how she got her home. If consistent with [[PC-98]] [[canon]], she lived in [[Makai]] before moving here.

===Kourindou===
{{main|Kourindou}}
:Kourindou is an antique store seated between the [[Human Village]] and the forest, run by [[Rinnosuke Morichika]].

The {{nihongo|'''Former Capital'''|旧都|Kyuuto}} is a large village in [[Former Hell]], deep within the [[Underworld]]. It is situated between the [[Deep Road to Hell]], guarded by [[Parsee Mizuhashi]], and the [[Palace of the Earth Spirits]], where the sisters [[Satori Komeiji]] and [[Koishi Komeiji]] live.

==General Information==
The buildings appear to be modelled after traditional Japanese houses, and the streets appear to be lit with fiery hanging lanterns. Although the city is built underground, it is still able to receive snowfall.

The capital is populated primarily by [[oni]], who moved underground long ago as part of a deal with the [[yama]]s. After promising to keep a lid on the [[vengeful spirit]]s that remained there after the yama relocated [[Hell]], the oni were given permission to stay there. As such, many oni, such as [[Yuugi Hoshiguma]], can easily be found partying in the streets here. [[Suika Ibuki]] most likely lived here before moving to [[Gensokyo]], and may at times visit here. Aside from the oni, many other subterranean [[youkai]] can probably be found here on occasions, as [[Yamame Kurodani]] mentions that the city doesn't turn away visitors.

==Capital's Appearances==
===Games===
;''Subterranean Animism''
The capital first appears on [[Stage]] 3 of ''[[Subterranean Animism]]''. After [[Reimu Hakurei]] or [[Marisa Kirisame]] passed [[Parsee Mizuhashi]] at the [[Deep Road to Hell]], they'll travel through the streets here. They'll fight [[Fairy|fairies]] and [[flying yin-yangs]] will emerge from the distance at the start of the stage. [[Yuugi Hoshiguma]] will come and fight the heroines as a midboss, and after a [[spell card]], she'll wander in front of the heroine down the street. She was surprised when she found out that [[vengeful spirit]]s were leaking out to the above from the [[Underworld]]. After she was defeated, she'll point the heroine towards the [[Palace of the Earth Spirits]].

===Spin-offs===
;''Double Spoiler''
The capital appears in ''[[Double Spoiler]]'' on [[stage]] 6, where [[Aya Shameimaru]] and [[Hatate Himekaidou]] encounters [[Yuugi Hoshiguma]] and [[Suika Ibuki]] to try and take photos of their [[danmaku]]. The previous stage is at the [[Palanquin Ship]], whilst the next stage is in [[Makai]], above [[Hokkai]]. There are 8 scenes total on this stage.

{{nihongo|'''Former Hell'''|旧地獄|kyuu-jigoku}} is a region in the [[Underworld]] that was inhabited by many souls long ago that once used to be [[Hell]] itself, hence the name. The region itself formed by the bridge guarded by [[Parsee Mizuhashi]] at the [[Deep Road to Hell]], the [[Former Capital]] of Hell, and the [[Palace of the Earth Spirits]].

==General Information==
Many oni used to work here. Eventually, because of overpopulation, the [[Yama]]s decided to move Hell to another place, so everyone moved out; thus the place became known as Former Hell. It has become a forgotten prison for [[vengeful spirit]], left over from before the move. Other oni that had been living above-ground then moved into Former Hell, and other subterranean [[youkai]] are also known to lurk around here, making it their paradise. The oni were given permission by the [[yama]] to live here. It's also a place where the youkai from above can't interfere with. It's said that the [[Palace of the Earth Spirits]] was constructed here after the [[Underworld]] was separated from Hell. 

It is not revealed as to when [[Hell]] moved from this location to make this place "Former Hell". The event in question seems to have took place before ''[[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]]'' in 2003, the starting point of the current ''[[Touhou Project]]'', since [[Suika Ibuki]] was the first oni to appear in [[Gensokyo]] for a long while in ''[[Immaterial and Missing Power]]''. It's also unknown whether this place is connected to the [[Hell]] of ''[[Highly Responsive to Prayers]]'' as there is confusion with the [[canon]]icity of the [[PC-98]].

==Former Hell's Appearances==
===Games===
;''Subterranean Animism''
Former Hell first appears on [[Stage]] 3 and 4 of ''[[Subterranean Animism]]''. After [[Reimu Hakurei]] or [[Marisa Kirisame]] passed [[Parsee Mizuhashi]] at the [[Deep Road to Hell]] on Stage 2, they'll travel through Former Hell, going through the streets of the [[Former Capital]]. They'll fight [[Fairy|fairies]] and [[flying yin-yangs]] will emerge from the distance at the start of the stage. [[Yuugi Hoshiguma]] will come and fight the heroines as a midboss, and after a [[spell card]], she'll wander in front of the heroine down the street. She was surprised when she found out that [[vengeful spirit]]s were leaking out to the above from the [[Underworld]]. After she was defeated, she'll point the heroine towards the [[Palace of the Earth Spirits]]. They'll roam through the palace on stage 4, where they'll encounter [[Rin Kaenbyou]] in her [[cat]] form twice as a midboss. After more roaming, the heroine, will encounter [[Satori Komeiji]]. After they've had a battle, Satori will point the heroines towards the courtyard that leads to the [[Remains of Blazing Hell]] for the cause of geysers and [[vengeful spirit]]s in [[Gensokyo]].

;''Touhou Gouyoku Ibun''
The taotie [[Yuuma Toutetsu]] discovers the Sea of Petroleum within Former Hell and attempts to seize control of it for herself. The Sea of Petroleum is, in truth, the Abandoned Hell of Blood Pools, a gigantic sea of blood made up of condemned souls overflowing with avarice. As souls were condemned to the sea of blood, its size and avarice grew, and eventually even the oni became so horrified by it that they stopped sending the condemned into it. When Hell was relocated, the oni were pleased to leave the sea of blood behind and forget about its existence.

The {{nihongo|'''Garden of the Sun'''|太陽の畑|Taiyō no Hata}} is a field full of sunflowers that is home to numerous [[Fairy|fairies]] and [[youkai]], including [[Yuuka Kazami]] and [[Eternity Larva]].

==General Information==
The threat level to this location is 'medium' and [[Fairy|fairies]] are easily encounterable. The garden is filled with dazzling yellow sunflowers, and it is said that it is located in the heart of [[Gensokyo]], from the opposite side of a mountain. It's apparently shaped a bit like a south-facing bowl, so it's hard to find it from a distance. It is also located not far from the [[Human Village]], where some [[human]]s may come here to look at its beauty. However, this field can become a concert venue for spirited [[youkai]] during the night. If a human carelessly got caught in one, you'll likely be surrounded by a great number of youkai; however, it might not be a big issue, but escaping would be difficult. The [[Prismriver Sisters]] often perform here.

The sunflowers seem quite ordinary, so the field is a popular sunbathing spot for fairies in the day. Even if humans came during the day, they'd be mocked by a great number of fairies. Therefore, [[Hieda no Akyuu]] says she hides somewhere whilst viewing the field.

[[Yuuka Kazami]] can be found here due to the number of sunflowers, having it her most active area. An anonymous person stated that they saw her here with a terrifying smile, making them run away. However, it's unknown if she actually lives here. In the [[PC-98]] [[canon]], she lives in [[Mugenkan]] within the [[Fantasy World]], located behind the [[Hakurei Shrine]].

==The Garden's Appearance==
;''Phantasmagoria of Flower View''
The Garden of the Sun appeared as a stage location in ''[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]'', in which [[Yuuka Kazami]] is dedicated to this location. The location is generally dedicated to stage 7 on [[Medicine Melancholy]] and [[Komachi Onozuka]]'s scenario, but on stage 8 (penultimate stage) on [[Cirno]], [[Lunasa Prismriver]] and [[Mystia Lorelei]]'s scenario. Most of the cast will come here looking for an area where they can enjoy themselves away from the incident where everyone is, but unfortunately end up being encountered by Yuuka. Usually, when the a character "defeats" Yuuka, it is instead that they flee from Yuuka for being too powerful.

;''Hidden Star in Four Seasons''
This place is not referenced directly in the main game, but according to [[Kasen]] in [[Wild and Horned Hermit]] and [[Cirno]] in [[Visionary Fairies in Shrine]] this is the main location of the summer season during the Four Seasons incident and the location of Stage 1 should be in the surroundings. Though, it's possible that this location is simply the epicenter of the summer season, having managed to spread over to what is implied to be the Youkai Mountain's foothills. &lt;ref&gt;"So above the forests in the foothills, it's midsummer. Even though it was autumn over at the mountain..." - ''[[Hidden Star in Four Seasons]]: [[Hidden Star in Four Seasons/Story/Aya's Scenario|Aya's Scenario]] (Stage 1)''&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo||鯢呑亭|'''Geidontei'''|roughly "whale drink pavilion"}} is a traditional Japanese style bar located somewhere in the [[human village]].

==Name==
Geidontei makes reference to the Japanese word {{lang|jp|鯨呑}} (Geidon), with the kanji for male whales ({{lang|jp|鯨}}) replaced with the one for female whales ({{lang|jp|鯢}}). "''Geidon''" refers to when a powerful existence swallows up a small creature in one gulp, like how a whale swallows up its prey. It is commonly used to describe powerful countries invading and taking smaller countries's land.

The Sanshoku ({{lang|jp|蚕食}}) in Sanshoku Geidontei is signify as "Encroaching". It can also be read as "three meals" or "three colors".

==General information==
The bar is owned by an [[Minor_Characters#Geidontei.27s_Owner|old man]]. Although [[Miyoi Okunoda]] is the poster girl of Geidontei, she is also a [[Zashiki-warashi]] that lives and works there, something the owner doesn't seem to know about, and that Miyoi herself wants to keep a secret.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lotus Eaters]] - Chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt; Accoring to [[Marisa Kirisame]] the owner is famous for the stewed vegetables he makes, but since it's mostly frequented by old men, it seems she has never been there prior to the events of ''[[Lotus Eaters]]''.&lt;ref name="LE1&gt;[[Lotus Eaters]] - Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt;

An agreement was made by Miyoi, Suika, and Mamizou to allow Geidontei to open to only Youkai on after-hours.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lotus Eaters]] - Chapter 7&lt;/ref&gt; The late night gathering was named Sanshoku Geidontei. Its current members are Miyoi Okunoda, [[Suika Ibuki]], [[Mamizou Futatsuiwa]], and [[Aya Shameimaru]], though [[Yukari Yakumo]] also knows about its secret activities.

{{nihongo|'''Genbu Ravine'''|玄武の沢|Genbu no Sawa}} is a ravine named after the legendary tortoise [[wikipedia:Black Tortoise|Genbu]] ({{lang|ja|玄武}}). Formed when [[Youkai Mountain]] was still an active volcano. The bottom is covered with hexagonal cracks so it looks like a turtle shell, and it is surrounded by six-sided cliffs. This [[wikipedia:Columnar jointing|bizarre rock formation]] was made when lava flowing from Youkai Mountain cooled and hardened.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cage in Lunatic Runagate]]: [[Cage in Lunatic Runagate/Fourth Chapter|Chapter 4]]&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Symposium of Post-mysticism]], it is home to some of the [[kappa]], including [[Nitori Kawashiro]]. Recently, pipes have been shown to be running though the walls of the ravine.

==Genbu Ravine's Appearances==
===Spin-offs===
The ravine made an appearance as stage location in ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]'', making it a location for many characters to fight. If connecting ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]'' to this game, then the stage can be selectable on arcade mode. It then re-appeared again in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'' and ''[[Urban Legend in Limbo]]'' as a stage location dedicated to [[Nitori Kawashiro]], having a completely different appearance from the previous games.

{{nihongo|'''Gensokyo'''|幻想郷|gensoukyou{{ref|romanization}}|"Land of Illusions" or "Land of Fantasy"}} is the setting of ''[[Touhou Project]]''. Its culture vaguely resembles that of feudal Japan, heavily embellished with folkloric elements.

==General Information==
Gensokyo was originally a desolate, haunted region of Japan ages ago. The [[youkai]] that lived there began to terrorize the surrounding lands, because of this, powerful and heroic [[Human|humans]] were sent to exorcise and exterminate them. As time passed, the technology and population of humans increased greatly, which lead to an increase in human influence. Due to this, [[Yukari Yakumo]] implemented a plan roughly 500 years ago to restore the power of [[youkai]] in Gensokyo by creating a "Barrier that divides Reality and Fantasy" (the plan was called "妖怪拡張計画, "Youkai Expansion Project"). From that day, Gensokyo became a place where it brought in things that have become fantasy outside; in other words, things that were forgotten in the [[Outside World]] such as [[youkai]], lost items, and such are transported into Gensokyo.&lt;ref name="PMiSS_Yukari"&gt;''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'': [[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Yukari Yakumo|Yukari Yakumo]]&lt;/ref&gt; It's said that it's hard for things that have become fantasy to leave Gensokyo, but beings that are powerful enough possesses the ability to leave Gensokyo at their will. In 1885 A.D., Gensokyo was sealed off from the increasingly scientific world once again with the creation of a second barrier, which was called the [[Great Hakurei Barrier]]. There has been little contact with the outside world ever since. It's known that the language spoken in Gensokyo is modern [[wikipedia:Japanese language|Japanese]]&lt;ref name="INR&amp;Y"&gt;[[Imperishable Night]]: [[Imperishable Night/Story/Barrier Team's Scenario|Barrier Team's Scenario]]&lt;/ref&gt;.

Gensokyo is populated by youkai, humans, and animals. Some of its inhabitants went there to hide, to escape, to find shelter when no-one and nowhere else would accept them. Many of them just like the natural darkness.

===Geography===
{{Main|Locations|l1=Locations}}

Gensokyo, the area encompassed by the [[Great Hakurei Barrier]], is a landlocked territory comprised mainly of forested mountains. Notable geographic features include the [[Youkai Mountain]] with communities of [[kappa]] at its base, [[tengu]] at its peak, and the [[Moriya Shrine]] at a lake near the top; the [[Forest of Magic]]; the [[Bamboo Forest of the Lost]] where [[Eientei]] is located; the [[Misty Lake]] next to the [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]]; the [[Human Village]] and adjacent [[Myouren Temple]], which are assumed to be in a fertile valley; the [[Sanzu River]] separating Gensokyo from [[Higan]]; and the [[Hakurei Shrine]] at the east of Gensokyo.

Although passing through the Hakurei Barrier to the [[Outside World]] is normally impossible for weaker people, stronger entities can pass through. It's also significantly easier for Gensokyo denizens to access domains of [[god]]s, [[demon]]s, and [[spirit]]s which aren't strictly part of Gensokyo itself. These include [[Higan]], the [[Netherworld]], [[Makai]], [[Heaven]], [[Senkai]] and the [[Underworld]].

The [[Cage in Lunatic Runagate/Fourth Chapter|fourth chapter]] of ''[[Cage in Lunatic Runagate]]'' reveals that the Youkai Mountain preserves the original appearance of Mount Yatsugatake before [[Konohana-Sakuyahime]], the goddess of Mount Fuji, tore it down out of jealousy. In the [[outside world]] today, the remnants of the mountain can be seen as the [[Wikipedia:Yatsugatake Mountains|Yatsugatake mountain range]] in [[Wikipedia:Yatsugatake-Chūshin Kōgen Quasi-National Park|Yatsugatake-Chūshin Kōgen Quasi-National Park]] between Nagano and Yamanashi Prefectures, providing a possible indication of where Gensokyo would be located in Japan. {{nihongo|[[Wikipedia:Lake Suwa|Lake Suwa]]|諏訪湖|Suwa-ko}} and Mount Moriya, which [[Suwako Moriya]] was named after, are located nearby.

===Creatures===
{{Main|:Category:Bestiary|l1=Category: Bestiary}}
Creatures of all shapes and sizes inhabit the world of Gensokyo, most drawing inspiration from Japanese legends and folklore.

[[Human]]s are one of the major populations in Gensokyo. [[Youkai]] essentially make up the rest, though "youkai" tends to be an umbrella term, and essentially can be used to encompass everything non-human. Many youkai are sub-classified into other races, such as [[devil]]s, [[magician]]s, [[vampire]]s, [[Fairy|fairies]], [[kappa]], [[oni]], and many more.

Many types of spirits also inhabit the world, such as [[Ghost]]s, [[Poltergeist]]s, [[Evil spirit]]s, [[Divine spirit]]s, a number of [[Tsukumogami]], and [[apparition]]s.

===Items===
{{Main|:Category:Objects|l1=Category: Objects}}
Many unusual items exist in Gensokyo, of which quite a few are based in Japanese mythology in one way or another. However, given Gensokyo's nature as a "land of that which is forgotten", even more modern items that have fallen out of style for a long time (such as the Game Boy) have occasionally turned up. Many of these "new" items appear near [[Muenzuka]], and both [[Rinnosuke Morichika]] and [[Nazrin]] are said to have picked up various objects there.

In addition to the unusual items floating in, many goods are the same as those from old Japan. Goods like black tea and coffee are considered to be a luxury.&lt;ref name="cola4"&gt;[[Curiosities of Lotus Asia]] - Chapter 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media===
{{Main|Bunbunmaru Newspaper|Kakashi Spirit News}}
There are two known sources of media in Gensokyo: the [[Bunbunmaru Newspaper]], written and edited by [[Aya Shameimaru]]; and the [[Kakashi Spirit News]], by [[Hatate Himekaidou]]. The former seems to be far more popular, however, with its sometimes loose depictions of reality.

===Timeline===
{{Main|Gensokyo Timeline}}
Gensokyo exists roughly parallel to the real world. As the inhabitants of Gensokyo, however, have developed their spiritual lives instead of following the trend of technological advancements in the real world, Gensokyo itself can appear to be a Japan from hundreds of years ago.

==Gensokyo's Appearances==
[[File:Th075Gensokyo.jpg|thumb|200px|The 'Gensokyo' [[stage]] in ''[[Immaterial and Missing Power]]'']]
===Windows Games===
;''Immaterial and Missing Power''
There is a [[stage]] in ''[[Immaterial and Missing Power]]'' associated with [[Suika Ibuki]], simply titled 'Gensokyo', appearing as a floor of mist through which [[Hakurei Shrine]] may be seen below. In the background, a giant [[moon]] hangs in the sky. It is the final stage in each [[character]]'s scenario.

==Gensokyo in other Canon works==
===PC-98===
{{Main|Canon#Canonicity and comparison between windows and PC-98|l1=Canon: Canonicity and comparison between windows and PC-98}}

The setting of the PC-98 games was initially called {{nihongo|'''The Eastern Country'''|東の国|Azuma no kuni}}. The name ''Gensokyo'' first appeared in Lotus Land Story as part of the game's title, ''Touhou Gensokyo'', and it has garnered a few mentions in the [[Mystic Square/Music|Mystic Square Music Room]]&lt;ref name="MS Music room"&gt;Sara's theme&lt;/ref&gt;, albeit most likely as a reference to the music of Lotus Land Story itself. However, ZUN has confirmed the Eastern Country in the PC-98 games to be the same world as Gensokyo as in the Windows games.&lt;ref name="ZUN's AWA Q&amp;A Panel"&gt;[[ZUN's AWA Q&amp;A Panel]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The PC-98 world isn't as clearly defined, but it has some notable locations - including the [[Human Village]] and the [[Hakurei Shrine]]. Other worlds bordering the Eastern Country include [[Makai]], the [[Fantasy World]], [[Mugenkan]] and [[Reimaden]], with their borders set behind the mountain which the Hakurei Shrine sits at the foot of. Oddly, there's also a modern American diner.&lt;ref&gt;[[Story of Eastern Wonderland]] – Reimu A's Ending&lt;/ref&gt;

===Seihou===
{{Seihou note|section}}
It's never stated what kind of world [[Reimu Hakurei]] and [[Marisa Kirisame]] are from, as it's referred to as simply {{nihongo|"the East"|東}}. From there, it's presumed that [[VIVIT]] travelled down the [[Seihou World#Silk Road|Silk Road]] towards the [[Hakurei Shrine]] to find the [[Holy Grail]], where she bumps into the said two characters.

It was shown that a large amount of vegetation existed in the East compared to the extinct vegetation on [[Seihou World#Earth|Seihou World's Earth]]'s apart from cacti. In respect to this, Touhou's ''[[Dolls in Pseudo Paradise]]'' had a statement that may indicate that the [[Great Hakurei Barrier]] also existed during this game as it does in the Windows canon of the ''Touhou Project''. It also has a statement that may indicate VIVIT saying "Oh, that girl... doesn't look like a human nor a youkai."

===Uwabami Breakers===
{{Uwabami note|section}}
In ''[[Uwabami Breakers]]'', [[Isami Asama]] heard a story that if you drink at the [[Twilight Bar Room]] until morning, you'd see "A mysterious world of curtain fire," referring to Gensokyo. Also, it's presumed that the Twilight Bar Room is located in the [[outside world]].

===Project Blank===
{{Project blank note|section}}
Gensokyo may have been referenced in ''[[Project Blank]]'''s first game ''[[Samidare]]'', where [[C23]] encounters [[Yuki]] and [[Mai]] in the 3rd area of the Extra stage, with normal enemies as [[bakebake]] and the background has a resemblance of a [[Shinto]] theme.

==Notes==
{{note|romanization}} Though "Gensoukyou" or "Gensōkyō" are considered correct, it is spelled "Gensokyo" in ''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Phantasm Stage while "Gensoukyo" is used on The ''[[Grimoire of Marisa]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s back cover.

The {{nihongo|'''Giant Toad's Pond'''|大蝦蟇の池|Oo-gama no Ike}} is a small, mysterious pond that can be found halfway up the [[Youkai Mountain]].

==General Information==
It is rather difficult to get to this place due to being in the middle of the mountain. The pond's water is said to have divine properties necessary for Shinto rituals, and lotus flowers can be seen growing on its surface.&lt;ref name="PMiSSToadPond"&gt;[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]: [[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Giant Toad's Pond|Giant Toad's Pond]]&lt;/ref&gt; The lotus flowers in the pond are beautiful and lotus leaves and flowers floating on the surface lit by sunbeams filtered through the surrounding foliage further emphasize the mysteriousness of the pond. There is a small shrine located near to the pond about which not much is known. It was built so long ago that no one knows who it was built by or for whom any more. Humans sometimes leave offerings here.&lt;ref name="PMiSSToadPond" /&gt; The offering left here immediately disappear, believed to be taken by the [[tengu]].

The threat level of this place is 'medium', and it is home to the [[Giant Toad]], the protector of the pond. It is said to violently attack those who desecrate the pond, but be otherwise passive. It is said that he protects those who leave it offerings, and that a sign of its protection is to be trailed by toads.&lt;ref name="PMiSSToadPond" /&gt; This is also the location where [[Cirno]] [[Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red/Cirno|was eaten by the Giant Toad]].

==The Pond's Appearance==
===Games===
;''Phantasmagoria of Flower View''
The pond appeared in ''[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]'' as a [[stage]] location associated with [[Aya Shameimaru]].  The stage generally appears on stage 7 in some of the scenarios of the game. Some characters end up here because they cannot find the source to the cause of the flower incident in the game, getting fed up of going to the same old locations, but may end up spotting Aya and fighting her here. In [[Eiki Shiki, Yamaxanadu]]'s scenario, she'll come here to see if Aya has been keeping up with what she (supposed to have) learnt by the [[yama]], to which she hasn't.

===Spin-offs===
;''Shoot the Bullet''
The pond appears on [[stage]] 3 of ''[[Shoot the Bullet]]'', where [[Aya Shameimaru]] encounters [[Alice Margatroid]] and [[Keine Kamishirasawa]] to try and take photos of their [[danmaku]]. The previous stage is at the [[Misty Lake]], whilst the next stage is at the [[Hill of the Nameless]]. There are 8 scenes in this stage.

The {{nihongo|'''Great Hakurei Barrier'''|博麗大結界|''Hakurei Dai-Kekkai''}} is the barrier that hides [[Gensokyo]] away from the [[Outside World]], and which allows [[youkai]] to survive within even when outside humans no longer believe in them. It is known that the [[Hakurei Shrine]] is located on the border and believed that [[Yukari Yakumo]] lives somewhere along the border as well (though not near the shrine).

== History ==
Sometime in the 15th century, the youkai now known as [[Yukari Yakumo]] set the groundwork for the barrier with her "Youkai Expansion Project", turning Gensokyo into a haven for youkai by enchanting it to attract the fantastic and repel the mundane.&lt;ref name="PMiSS_Yukari"&gt;''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'': [[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Yukari Yakumo|Yukari Yakumo]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'': [[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Monologue|Monologue]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SCoOW"&gt;''[[Strange Creators of Outer World]]'' vol. 1: [[Strange Creators of Outer World/Basic Knowledge of Fantastic Words 2015|Basic Knowledge of Fantastic Words 2015]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Barrier was proposed by Yukari and the other [[Sages of Gensokyo]] and erected later in Meiji 18 (CE 1885). Although the Gensokyo Record states that it was made by [[human]] priests and later reinforced by [[youkai]],&lt;ref name="PCB_prologue"&gt;''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]'': [[Perfect_Cherry_Blossom/Story/Prologue|Prologue]]&lt;/ref&gt; ZUN has commented that the Gensokyo Record is unreliable&lt;ref&gt;[[ZUN's E-mails]]&lt;/ref&gt; and that Yukari is widely acknowledged as the creator of the Barrier&lt;ref&gt;''[[Curiosities of Lotus Asia]]'' - '''Chapter 26:''' Prologue and Rinnosuke's monologue&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PMiSS_Yukari" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wahh 25"&gt;''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'' - Chapter 25&lt;/ref&gt; One doubter of this is [[Yuyuko Saigyouji]], who doubts that even Yukari could form such a strong barrier)&lt;ref&gt;''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]''— Ending 5 Reimu B. "I don't think even SHE can form such a strong barrier."&lt;/ref&gt;. While the idea was at first highly controversial among youkai and led to much infighting between them, it is now almost universally accepted.

The barrier is so important to Gensokyo that the year of its formation is now marked as the year 0 in the [[Gensokyo Timeline|Gensokyo Calendar]].

== Modern Era ==
The [[Hakurei Shrine]], which exists on both sides of the border, is ''supposed'' to be its only gateway. However, the phenomenon of "spiriting away" can also cause objects and even living beings to slip through the border at random, particularly if they have started to be forgotten by the outside world. For instance the [[wikipedia:crested ibis|crested ibis]] started to become more common in Gensokyo after the Japanese variety were recognised as extinct, and paper started showing up more frequently with the rise of digital storage. Outside humans are not protected by the [[Spell Card]] rules and thus can be freely preyed on by youkai, but they may choose to become citizens of the [[Human Village]] or request for the Hakurei shrine maiden to send them home.

Even in modern times, it is still possible for youkai, gods and even entire locations (such as the [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]] and [[Moriya Shrine]]) to pass through the border and enter Gensokyo.

While some youkai (most notably [[Yukari Yakumo]], [[Nue Houjuu]] and the [[zashiki-warashi]]) have shown the ability to exit Gensokyo and travel to the outside world, it appears that this requires uncommon knowledge, abilities and/or conditions, as other characters seem to think of it as nigh-impossible. It is believed that youkai go on "hunting trips" through the border to gather humans from the outside world as food, disguising the kidnappings as stories of people running away from home,&lt;ref name="PCB_prologue" /&gt; but it is unclear how and when these are performed.

== Structure ==
[[File:SaBND_Hakurei_Barrier_ch25.png|200px|thumb|left|A tear in the barrier, from ''[[Strange and Bright Nature Deity]]'': Chapter 25.]]
As a "boundary of common sense" the barrier is designed to affect only living things and their creations, while allowing natural forces to pass through (hence the barrier is permeable to sunlight, and Gensokyo's rivers are connected to those of the Outside World). The space on the edges of the barrier is [[wikipedia:non-Euclidean geometry|non-Euclidean]] - humans who attempt to leave the barrier will find themselves encountering the same landmarks over and over, without ever getting any further from where they started.&lt;ref name="wahh 25" /&gt;

''[[Urban Legend in Limbo]]'' describes two ways of travelling through the Barrier. True, complete passage can be achieved by punching a hole in the barrier and walking through. However, beings may also enter or leave Gensokyo by being "spirited away", a method which is often only temporary and allows only certain items to be brought inside or outside Gensokyo.&lt;ref&gt;[[Urban Legend in Limbo]] - Mamizou's ending&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these spirited away travellers have little physical presence (sometimes to the point of appearing only as a shadow) and will eventually be pulled back home, remembering their trip as if it were only a dream. In fact at least some of these trips have taken the form of literal dreams, with the traveller's mind returning to their body when they awake. However, it is still possible for a dreamer in the Outside World to bring some objects from Gensokyo to the Outside World and viceversa. Yukari is known for being the one who purposedly spirits away humans by causing fluctuations in the barrier.&lt;ref&gt;[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]] - Yukari Yakumo's profile&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Wild and Horned Hermit]] - Chapter 35&lt;/ref&gt;

The barrier is weaker around objects which carry the spiritual energy of the Outside World. Usually this effect is barely noticable, outside of concentrated sources like the [[Occult Ball]]s. However, when one of the trees around the Hakurei Shrine was killed, a tree from the Outside World was drawn in to replace it, causing the surrounding area to become distorted.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Strange and Bright Nature Deity]]'': Chapters 23-25&lt;/ref&gt; On another occasion [[Rinnosuke Morichika]] was briefly drawn into the Outside World due to concentrating on an MP3 player while Reimu was nearby tampering with the barrier.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Curiosities of Lotus Asia]]'': [[Curiosities of Lotus Asia/Chapter 11|Chapter 11]]&lt;/ref&gt;

As shown in ''[[Touhou Bougetsushou]]'', the similarity of the Great Hakurei Barrier to the barrier which surrounds the [[Lunar Capital]] means that it is possible to travel between them with a [[Lunar Veil]], or even a specially-constructed rocket, without ever passing through the [[Outside World]].  As Yukari's first attempt at invading the Moon predates the barrier's construction, it is possible that Gensokyo's barrier was at least partially based on that of the Lunar Capital.

{{nihongo|'''Hakugyokurou'''|白玉楼||lit. "Tower of White Jade"}} is a [[ghost]] shrine overlooking the [[Netherworld]]. It is well known among the afterlife realms for its cherry blossom gardens, and many ghosts come to see them every spring.

The term Hakugyokurou comes from Chinese legends of the Tang Dynasty ({{lang|ja|唐朝}}). It was said to be the place where artists go after death. Li He ({{lang|ja|李賀}}), a poet from the Tang Dynasty, heard a voice in a dream he had as he was dying; the voice said, "Hakugyokurou has been completely built, so come and write down its details." The story is the beginning of Hakugyokurou.

[[Yuyuko Saigyouji]] is the lady of Hakugyokurou, and [[Youmu Konpaku]] acts as its gardener. The massive [[youkai]] cherry tree, the [[Saigyou Ayakashi]], can also be found lying dormant in the gardens of Hakugyokurou.

Hakugyokurou was the location for stages 5 and 6 of ''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]'', and several fights in ''[[Immaterial and Missing Power]]'' and ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]''.

The {{Nihongo|'''Hakurei Shrine'''|博麗神社|Hakurei Jinja}} is a small, run-down [[wikipedia:Shinto shrine|Shinto shrine]] located on the [[Great Hakurei Barrier]] on the east side of [[Gensokyo]]. It's a key location that has appeared in many of the official games' prologues, [[stage]]s, in character endings and in other official literature by [[ZUN]]. It's the home of the ''[[Touhou Project]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s protagonist: [[Reimu Hakurei]].

The shrine has become a popular hangout for all sorts of [[youkai]] who Reimu and company defeat in the course of the games. However, because of this, very few (normal) [[human]]s come to the shrine, and even fewer (if any at all) leave donations, but because it is a place where human faith gathers, [[Aunn Komano]] tends to guard the place without being asked.

The Hakurei Shrine was once the only shrine in Gensokyo, but the [[Moriya Shrine]] has since settled on the [[Youkai Mountain]]. Also adding to religious competition is the [[Myouren Temple]] and the [[Hall of Dreams' Great Mausoleum]]; the former is a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] temple led by [[Byakuren Hijiri]] and the latter is held by [[Taoism|Taoists]] run by [[Toyosatomimi no Miko‎]].

From ''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'' chapter 8, it's known that there is money scattered around the shrine. Although the ones found by Reimu may have been planted there by the [[Unnamed Kuda-gitsune]]. It's later seen that like all shrines, the Hakurei Shrine offers omamori. Although with [[The Hakurei God|the Hakurei Shrine's god]] in question, it's unknown if the omamori would even provide anyone with divine power.

==General information==
The Hakurei Shrine existed long before the [[Great Hakurei Barrier|sealing of Gensokyo]] in 1885,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]''—P.113.&lt;/ref&gt; and is known in the outside world as well.&lt;ref name="gfc"&gt;[[Ghostly Field Club]] - Story.&lt;/ref&gt; The generations of Hakurei [[Shrine maiden]]s have lived here for centuries.

The very existence of both Reimu Hakurei and her shrine ensures the continued existence of Gensokyo by protecting and maintaining the Great Hakurei Barrier, thus making it one of the most important locations in the ''[[Touhou Project]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]: [[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Reimu Hakurei|Reimu Hakurei]] &amp;mdash; ''"The Hakurei shrine maidens control the Great Hakurei Boundary and protect Gensokyo. ... Gensokyo relies on the Hakurei Shrine and its shrine maidens to continue to exist as it does today.''"&lt;/ref&gt; However, even with its high status, the shrine has been attacked and destroyed by [[youkai]] several times over the course of the games. It's able to serve its function as a shrine even when destroyed, but not as a place to live.&lt;ref&gt;[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]] Reimu's ending &amp;mdash; "It still serves its purpose as a shrine, but not as a place to live."&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory of the Hakurei Barrier, Reimu Hakurei and the survival of Gensokyo that many of the residents like [[Hieda no Akyuu]] who explained this in ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'' believe may be rather sketchy. Aside from the destroyed shrine, when Reimu Hakurei didn't come back from the [[Moon]] in ''[[Silent Sinner in Blue]]'', [[Aya Shameimaru]] talks about finding a new shaman for the Hakurei Shrine in a rather suspicious look. Although it isn't strange for some of the older characters to know a lot about the Hakurei Shrine, Aya seemed to know something important that wasn't made clear in Akyuu's article. Regardless of whether this is true or not, the shrine and shrine maiden appear to have more secrets than what is presently known.

Though the shrine has [[The Hakurei God|a patron god of its own]], not much is known about it other than it has been steadily losing faith, power and prestige due to the lack of worshippers&lt;ref&gt;[[Mountain of Faith]]: [[Mountain of Faith/Translation/Prologue|Prologue]] &amp;mdash; ''"The seldom-visited Hakurei shrine god's power had steadily diminished, until its opinion was completely ignored in conference by its myriad colleagues.''"&lt;/ref&gt; and that it's angry about this situation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Undefined Fantastic Object]] Reimu A ending &amp;mdash; [[Byakuren Hijiri]] knows just by visiting the shrine that it has very few followers because she can sense its god is angry.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Structure and premises===
[[File:SaBNDHakureiWarehouse.png|thumb|150px|Warehouse of Hakurei Shrine in ''[[Strange and Bright Nature Deity]]''.]]
Structurally, the shrine is old-fashioned and offers poor protection from the cold.&lt;ref&gt;[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]: [[Perfect Cherry Blossom/Translation/Prologue|Prologue]] &amp;mdash; ''"The shrine is old-fashioned, so it's easily penetrated by wind and other elements. It's as cold inside as it is outside."''&lt;/ref&gt; The grove of cherry trees behind the shrine is a particularly popular spot for flower viewing in spring.

There's a large donation box for visitors to leave money in, but since visitors are scarce, it's usually empty.&lt;ref&gt;[[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]]: [[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil/Translation/Reimu's Scenario#Stage 4|Reimu's Scenario]] &amp;mdash; ''"Reimu: My shrine rarely has any visitors during the year."''&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Yin-Yang Orb]], a powerful weapon usable only by blood members of the Hakurei clan, is also kept here. It was said in the [[PC-98]] that the orb is the greatest treasure of the shrine.

Since the events of ''[[Mountain of Faith]]'', Reimu has constructed a small shrine (about the size of a birdhouse) to [[Kanako Yasaka]] and [[Suwako Moriya]] at the edge of the Hakurei Shrine's grounds in an attempt to gather more faith. Despite its extremely small size, it does get an occasional visitor from the [[Human Village]]. Its blessings include a plentiful harvest and luck in [[danmaku]] battle.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mountain of Faith]] Reimu C Ending. The small bird-house shrine is confirmed to still exist at the Hakurei Shrine in Chapter 5 of ''[[Silent Sinner in Blue]]'', and it's mentioned it can be used to summon both Kanako and Suwako.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography and people==
[[File:PMiSS hakureishrine.jpg|thumb|150px|left|The Hakurei Shrine, as illustrated in ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]''.]]
[[File:Th105HakureiShrineBird'sEye.jpg|thumb|200px|A bird's-eye view of the shrine in ''[[SWR]]''.]]
The shrine exists on the [[Great Hakurei Barrier]] between the [[outside world]] and [[Gensokyo]], but is located in neither.&lt;ref&gt;[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]: [[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Hakurei Shrine|Hakurei Shrine]] &amp;mdash; ''"This shrine exists on the border between the outer world and Gensokyo. To be accurate, the place where this shrine exists is not in Gensokyo."''&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the shrine's only real purpose these days is to maintain the barrier that separates both worlds.&lt;ref&gt;[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]: [[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Reimu Hakurei|Reimu Hakurei]] &amp;mdash; "''The Hakurei Shrine exists to watch over the Great Boundary which ensures Gensokyo's existence...''"&lt;/ref&gt; It's simultaneously accessible from both sides, but some unknown circumstances must be met in order to travel from one side to the other. In addition, though the shrine exists on both sides of the border, the shrine reachable from the outside world is allegedly old and uninhabited,&lt;ref&gt;[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]: [[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Reimu Hakurei|Reimu Hakurei]] &amp;mdash; ''"Since the Hakurei Shrine stands on the boundary of Gensokyo from the outside world, one can go to the shrine from either world. But the two worlds can't be crossed between in this way. People from Gensokyo can go only to Gensokyo's Hakurei Shrine, and people from the outside world can go only to the outside world's Hakurei Shrine. It's said that the Hakurei Shrine seen from outside is a desolate, uninhabited shrine which no one visits.''"&lt;/ref&gt; as far as those in Gensokyo know.&lt;ref&gt;[[Curiosities of Lotus Asia]]: [[Curiosities of Lotus Asia/Chapter 11|Chapter 11]] &amp;mdash; ''"...My eyes were becoming accustomed to the light. This archway here was something I recognized... Is this a shrine? And there are are great number of people here too...''" Rinnosuke sees the outside world. Logically, he would still be near the border and this is thus the Hakurei Shrine, but this is unconfirmed, and the people there weren't speaking Japanese.&lt;/ref&gt;

Physically, the shrine is high in the mountains to the east from which all of Gensokyo is visible.&lt;ref&gt;[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]: [[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Hakurei Shrine|Hakurei Shrine]] &amp;mdash; ''"The only shrine on the eastern edge of Gensokyo. ... All of Gensokyo can be seen from this shrine, and it is famous for having the most beautiful cherry blossoms.''"&lt;/ref&gt; The path up from the [[Human Village]] is not difficult except in heavy snow, and even then the trip doesn't take more than an hour on foot.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'' - Chapter 38&lt;/ref&gt; Its location in the outside world is unknown (besides being in Japan), but it's near a city.&lt;ref&gt;[[Strange and Bright Nature Deity]] &amp;mdash; Chapter 25 shows the shrine overlooking a city with cars driving by. It's implied to be the outside world.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because it's located on the barrier, items from the outside world are known to sometimes appear near the shrine. Their use and purpose cannot usually be understood by the residents of Gensokyo, yet these items are still wondrous to both [[youkai]] and [[human]]s. Humans from beyond the border are also known to appear from time to time. As a result of these appearances, youkai and collectors keep a close eye on the shrine.&lt;ref&gt;[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]: [[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Hakurei Shrine|Hakurei Shrine]] &amp;mdash; ''"It has other special traits, often such as items from the outside world appearing within the proximity of the shrine or people from the outside world being spotted. ... The goods of the outer world are wondrous and popular among humans and youkai alike. For this reason, many collectors surround the shrine.''"&lt;/ref&gt;

The following characters are residents of the Hakurei Shrine:
*[[Reimu Hakurei]], the resident [[shrine maiden]], is the only character currently living inside the shrine.
*[[The Hakurei God]], which is enshrined within the [[Yin-Yang Orb]]s.
*The [[Three Fairies of Light]] have taken up residence behind the shrine premises as of ''[[Oriental Sacred Place]]''.
*[[Genjii]], although he's from the [[PC-98]] era and has yet to make a reappearance in a [[Windows]] game, [[ZUN]] has stated in at least two interviews that he imagines Genjii living in a pond behind the shrine.&lt;ref&gt;[[Meiji University talkshow "Dawn of Touhou"]] &amp;mdash; '''''Q.''' Where's Genjii (the turtle in PC-98 series) now? '''A.''' Probably living in the lake at the back of the shrine... at least he's not consumed.''&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Mima]], an [[evil spirit]] that haunted the shrine premises throughout the PC-98. As she has yet to make an appearance in the Windows Touhou games, it's unknown if she's still at the shrine, if she has been [[Wikipedia:retcon|retconned]] from the Touhou canon, or if she left the shrine by the present day.&lt;ref&gt;[[Curiosities of Lotus Asia]]: [[Curiosities of Lotus Asia/Chapter 25|Chapter 25]]  &amp;mdash; ''"There really aren't many records left that say. Although we did get taken over by an evil spirit in the past..."''&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Clownpiece]] is currently living underneath the shrine as of ''[[Visionary Fairies in Shrine]]''.&lt;ref name="VFiS1"&gt;[[Visionary Fairies in Shrine]] - Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Hakurei Shrine's appearances==
The Hakurei Shrine has made an appearance or been mentioned in most of the official games. It's commonly referenced in game prologues as the starting point from which new incidents are observed, and it has even been featured as a [[stage]] in a few of them.

===PC-98 games===
[[File:Th01Shrine.png|thumb|180px|The shrine in ''HRtP'']]
;''Highly Responsive to Prayers''
The shrine's very first début in the ''[[Touhou Project]]'' is in ''[[Highly Responsive to Prayers]]''. In the [[Highly Responsive to Prayers/Translation/Prologue|prologue]], [[youkai]] were trying to get the [[Human Village]] to destroy it, but also the shrine was initially destroyed by the final [[boss]] of whichever route the player chose (either the [[Hell]] or [[Makai]] route), thus [[Reimu Hakurei]] must go and exterminate these enemies. [[Stage]]s 1 to 5 of the game take place at the shrine, simply titled {{nihongo|'''Shrine'''|神社|Jinja}}. The stages are sort of a way as a tutorial to how the game's mechanics work. On Stage 5, Reimu shall encounter [[SinGyoku]], who is the [[boss]] of this stage. After Reimu defeated SinGyoku, the player now shall choose which route to take: Makai or Hell. Depending their chosen route, the rest of the game shall take place at one of these locations. All endings of the game also take place at the shrine, where in one ending the [[Yin-Yang Orb]] turned into a joyful spherical creature and started wrecking the shrine for unknown reasons.

;''Story of Eastern Wonderland''
In ''[[Story of Eastern Wonderland]]'''s [[Story of Eastern Wonderland/Story/Prologue|prologue]], [[Reimu Hakurei]] returns from the mountains to find that the shrine's overrun by [[bakebake]] and [[youkai]]. Consequently, stage 1 also takes place here.

;''Phantasmagoria of Dim.Dream''
In ''Phantasmagoria of Dim.Dream'''s [[Phantasmagoria of Dim.Dream/Story/Prologue|prologue]], the plot-centric [[Probability Space Hypervessel]] appears a short distance away from the shrine gateway. In Reimu's ending, she was shown to own [[Ruukoto]] who suppose to do chores at the shrine, but she isn't very good at doing them.

;''Lotus Land Story''
In ''[[Lotus Land Story]]'''s [[Lotus Land Story/Story/Prologue|prologue]], a group of [[bakebake]]s come barging into the shrine after Reimu wishes out loud for something to do.

;''Mystic Square''
In ''[[Mystic Square]]'''s [[Mystic Square/Story/Prologue|prologue]], Reimu was constantly exterminating [[demon]]s who were coming from [[Makai]] at the shrine. She then decided to go to Makai and give their [[Shinki|boss]] a lesson. Even though Reimu solved this, in her ending demons are still shown coming to the shrine anyway.

===Windows games===
;''Embodiment of Scarlet Devil''
In the [[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil/Story/Prologue|prologue]] of ''[[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]]'', the shrine is where Reimu first encountered the Scarlet mist caused by [[Remilia Scarlet]]. In the [[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil/Story/Extra Story|Extra Story]], Reimu, [[Marisa Kirisame]] and Remilia gather at the shrine.

;''Perfect Cherry Blossom''
In the [[Perfect Cherry Blossom/Story/Prologue|prologue]] of ''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]'', Reimu complains how it's cold at May in the shrine. In the [[Perfect Cherry Blossom/Afterword|Extra Story]] , Reimu, Marisa, [[Yuyuko Saigyouji]], [[Sakuya Izayoi]] and [[Youmu Konpaku]] gather at the shrine. It's revealed that many [[ghost]]s from the [[Netherworld]] have been visiting the shrine as a sight-seeing attraction (without leaving donations) due to the weakened barrier.

;''Imperishable Night''
In ''[[Imperishable Night]]'''s [[Imperishable Night/Story/Prologue|prologue]], it said that [[Yukari Yakumo]] went to the shrine to meet Reimu about the incident. In the [[Imperishable Night/Afterword|Extra Story]], [[Kaguya Houraisan]] appears before Reimu, Marisa, Sakuya and Youmu to challenge them to a "trial of guts" (the Extra Stage).

;''Phantasmagoria of Flower View''
The shrine only appears in various endings of ''[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]''.

;''Mountain of Faith''
In ''[[Mountain of Faith]]'''s [[Mountain of Faith/Story/Prologue|prologue]], Reimu and Marisa discuss the mysterious visitor that showed up that morning to demand she shut down the shrine. The [[Mountain of Faith/Translation/Extra Story|Extra Story]] has them once again discussing things at the shrine as they get suspicious on whether there is a second [[god]] at the [[Moriya Shrine]].

;''Subterranean Animism''
In ''[[Subterranean Animism]]'''s [[Subterranean Animism/Translation/Prologue|prologue]] a geyser spewing out Earth Spirits along with water appeared near the shrine grounds. During [[Subterranean Animism/Translation/Reimu and Yukari's Scenario|Reimu and Yukari's scenario]], Yukari remains at the shrine sipping Reimu's tea. In the [[Subterranean Animism/Story/Extra Story|Extra prologue]], [[Rin Kaenbyou]] and [[Utsuho Reiuji]] were invited to the shrine eating eggs boiled in water, where Utsuho told Reimu and Marisa that she was given power by two gods [[Youkai Mountain|from a mountain]], them been [[Kanako Yasaka]] and [[Suwako Moriya]].

;''Undefined Fantastic Object''
In ''[[Undefined Fantastic Object]]'''s [[Undefined Fantastic Object/Story/Prologue|prologue]], Reimu, Marisa and [[Sanae Kochiya]] gather at the shrine and discuss the appearance of the mysterious flying ship. The [[Undefined Fantastic Object/Story/Extra Story|Extra Story]] once again gathers them to discuss things, this time the [[Seed of Unknown Form|UFO-shaped objects]]. 

;''Ten Desires''
In ''[[Ten Desires]]'''s [[Ten Desires/Story/Prologue|prologue]], Reimu and Marisa are once again at the shrine attempting to enjoy the cherry blossoms, but the abundance of [[divine spirit]]s bothers them and spurrs them to head out to investigate. The [[Ten Desires/Story/Extra Story|extra story]] once again places both at the shrine, where they are joined by Sanae Kochiya and Youmu Konpaku to discuss the recent news and the appearance of the so-called [[Mamizou Futatsuiwa|youkai trumpcard]].

;''Double Dealing Character''
In the [[Double Dealing Character/Story/Prologue|prologue]] for ''[[Double Dealing Character]]'', the shrine is where Reimu discovered that her [[purification rod]] was moving on its own like its a [[tsukumogami]].

;''Hidden Star in Four Seasons''
In the [[Hidden Star in Four Seasons|prologue]] for ''[[Hidden Star in Four Seasons]]'', the shrine area is completely covered in cherry petals. Reimu and Marisa discuss about the sudden change in the weather that appears to be localized in different areas when Aya appears to give a brief summary of what's going on around [[Gensokyo]] after leaving in the same quickly manner she appeared. When Reimu and Marisa decided to take action, Gensokyo was already awash in the colors of the changing seasons.

===Spin-offs===
[[File:HakureiShrine.jpg|thumb|230px|The Hakurei Shrine as seen in ''[[IaMP]]'', ''[[SWR]]'' and ''[[Soku]]'']]
The shrine is a [[stage]] location in the fighters ''[[Immaterial and Missing Power]]'', ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]'', ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]'' and ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'', in which they all are dedicated to Reimu. Only in the third said game that the location does not appear in a scenario.

;''Immaterial and Missing Power''
All the feasts that occurred prior and after the events of described in the [[Immaterial and Missing Power/Translation/Prologue|prologue]] were held at the shrine. In addition, all character scenarios featured the shrine itself as a fighting stage.

;''Scarlet Weather Rhapsody''
During [[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody/Translation/Reimu's Scenario|Reimu's Scenario]] in ''Scarlet Weather Rhapsody'' the shrine's destroyed twice; the first time by an earthquake caused by [[Tenshi Hinanawi]], and the second by [[Yukari Yakumo]]. It was later rebuilt with the help of Sakuya, [[Alice Margatroid]] and [[Suika Ibuki]].

;''Gold Rush''
The shrine made an appearance as a [[stage]] location on the one-[[stage]] [[danmaku]] minigame ''[[Gold Rush]]'', where [[Seija Kijin]] somehow acquired the ultimate 10th "rule-breaking" item the Miracle Mallet (Real). It's capable of destroying danmaku, so she decides to make use of it by robbing the shrine before its power runs out. There, she fights Reimu, who is defeated after three [[spell card]]s. On a strange note, even though Seija fights Reimu at the shrine, the stage's background appears to be more towards the [[Moriya Shrine]] from ''[[Subterranean Animism]]''.

;''Urban Legend in Limbo''
The Hakurei Shrine once again appears as a stage location in ''[[Urban Legend in Limbo]]'', re-using the image from ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]''. This is where a hidden aura of [[Sumireko Usami]] first appeared, where Reimu attacks and ends up forgetting what happened after. On various scenarios such as Marisa's or Kasen's, if the player character has collected 7 [[Occult Ball]]s, then a gap will open outside the shrine before the final stage, leading to the [[Outside World]]. There's even a selectable stage to this event, titled {{nihongo|"Shrine During Incident"|異変の神社}}.

===Literature===
[[File:WaHHCh02HakureiShrinecolor.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The Hakurei Shrine as seen in ''Wild and Horned Hermit'' chapter 2.]]
The shrine's a common setting in the official manga. ''[[Strange and Bright Nature Deity]]'' and ''[[Oriental Sacred Place]]'' in particular often feature the shrine as a target of mischief by [[Three Fairies of Light]]. In ''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'', the shrine is primarily a location for talk between characters, and [[Kasen Ibaraki]] frequently comes to pay Reimu a visit.

===Music CDs===
The Hakurei Shrine is mentioned in the 11th track (''[[Illusionary Eternal Festival]]'') of [[ZUN]]'s second official Touhou music CD, ''[[Ghostly Field Club]]''. In the [[Ghostly Field Club/Story|story]], [[Renko Usami]] pulls out a photograph of what's presumably the shrine and proposes to [[Maribel Hearn]] that they pay it a visit. It's assumed they found their way to the Hakurei Shrine of the [[outside world]].

===Seihou Project===
{{Seihou note|section}}
;''Shuusou Gyoku''
The shrine made an appearance as the setting of the extra stage in ''[[Seihou Project]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s first work ''[[Shuusou Gyoku]]'', a [[danmaku]] game series by the junior doujin circle "[[Shunsatsu sare do?]]", where [[ZUN]] also contributed music and art to the game. It seems like ZUN used this location so [[Marisa Kirisame]] and [[Reimu Hakurei]] are still in their place of origin.

[[VIVIT]] travelled down the [[Seihou World#Silk Road|Silk Road]] towards the shrine in search for the [[Holy Grail]] where she encountered Reimu and [[Marisa Kirisame]]. There, she defeats Marisa and then Reimu, asking if they knew anything about the [[Holy Grail]], to which it confused Reimu, but not Marisa. However, due to the nature of the relationship between the two projects, the [[canon]]icity of this appearance is questionable. However, this story continues into the Extra stage of ''[[Samidare]]''.

The {{nihongo|'''Hall of Dreams' Great Mausoleum'''|夢殿大祀廟|Yumedono Daishibyou}} lies directly underneath the [[Myouren Temple]], and is the setting of stage 4, 5 and 6 of ''[[Ten Desires]]''. Within the [[Myouren Temple Cemetery]] next to the temple lies a cave, which leads to the Mausoleum. It holds many spirits such as [[Soga no Tojiko]]. Further inside lies the {{nihongo|'''Divine Spirit Mausoleum'''|神霊廟|Shinreibyō}}, in which the tomb of [[Toyosatomimi no Miko]] is located, but it's presumed that the temple was later re-located to [[Senkai]] based on details from [[Hopeless Masquerade]]. 

==General Information==
In the past, Miko's mausoleum was constantly sealed by Buddhists preventing her from resurrecting. As time passed legends like Toyosatomimi no Miko faded away transporting her mausoleum and everyone within it to [[Gensokyo]].

The Buddhist [[monk]] [[Byakuren Hijiri]]'s Myouren Temple originally was settled on top of where Toyosatomimi no Miko's mausoleum was located; as a [[saint]] of humans, the two would naturally be at odds. This choice ended up causing the seal to be broken. In Reimu's ending and Sanae's alternate ending of ''[[Ten Desires]]'', because they were opposed to living in a place under a temple of [[youkai]], Toyosatomimi and her followers relocated to a dōjō in another world called [[Senkai]]. 

As of [[Hopeless Masquerade|''Hopeless Masquerade'']], Miko had constructed a Taoist temple within [[Senkai]] known as the '''Divine Spirit Mausoleum''' (神霊廟). It welcomes humans aspiring to become hermits, but most of them fail the necessary training. It shares its name with the area in Stage 6 of Ten Desires. Based on Futo's Ending in Hopeless Masquerade, while not specifically called a Senkai, Miko and Futo's realm are described as "a space created by hermit arts, it's unclear if it's actually in Gensokyo." is extremely similar to the other descriptions of [[Senkai]].

Miko and her followers were also shown residing in Senkai in [[Wild and Horned Hermit]] Chapter 18.

==Background Information==
The Hall of Dreams' Great Mausoleum is based on the {{nihongo|[[wikipedia:Hōryū-ji#Yumedono (Hall of Dreams)|Hall of Dreams]]|夢殿|Yume-dono}} of [[wikipedia:Hōryū-ji|Houryuu-ji]]. It stands in a half area of the temple, {{nihongo|''Touin''|東院|lit. "Eastern Yard"}}, and the other area is {{nihongo|''Sai'in''|西院|lit. "Western Yard"}}. In the Hall of Dreams, there is [[wikipedia:Hōryū-ji#Yumedono (Guze) Kannon|Guze Kannon]], which is said to have the same height as [[wikipedia:Prince Shōtoku|Prince Shoutoku]], who [[Toyosatomimi no Miko]] is based on.

The Hall of Dreams stands on the ruins of Shoutoku's Palace. More precise explanation: Touin didn't exist yet when Sai'in was built. The original Houryuuji was made up by [[wikipedia:Prince Shōtoku|Prince Shoutoku]] and his aunt [[wikipedia:Empress Suiko|Empress Suiko]] for the completion of the Buddism project of his uncle or the [[wikipedia:Emperor Sushun|ex-Emperor Sushun]], who had been killed by the most famous man of Soga clan, [[wikipedia:Soga no Umako|Soga no Umako]]. Shoutoku was appointed regent of Suiko, governing well along with Umako. After Shoutoku died, the confrontation got worse between the Soga clan and the anti-Soga faction. Umako's grandson Soga no Iruka killed Shoutoku's son, [[wikipedia:Prince Yamashiro|Prince Yamahiro]] After a while, Iruka was assassinated, then the clan got far weaker, and disappeared after a little time. But Shoutoku's lineage had got a downfall. Then Touin was built later on the ruins of {{nihongo|''Ikaruga no Miya''|斑鳩宮|lit. "Palace of Ikaruga"}}, the former home of Shoutoku and his son, for the memorial monument of Shoutoku's good ethical personality and political skill. The central facility is the Hall of Dreams.

The entrance of the mausoleum is based on the gates of the Hsiahai Cheng-Huang Temple ({{lang|tw|霞海城隍廟}}) in Taipei, Taiwan. &lt;ref&gt;http://maps.google.ca/maps/place?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;cid=7596797163613549522&lt;/ref&gt; The image itself, however, is part of the stock photos that ImageFolio provides in its Oriental set. &lt;ref&gt;http://ifc.imagefolio.com/ImageFolio4_files/gallery/Stock_Photography/Oriental_Life/ORIENTAL082.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearances==
===Windows===
;''Ten Desires''
The mausoleum first appeared on stages 5 and 6 of ''[[Ten Desires]]''. Due to Toyosatomimi's ability to listen to ten desires at once, many divine spirits which were the manifestations of human desire became attracted to the mausoleum, causing [[Reimu Hakurei]], [[Marisa Kirisame]], [[Sanae Kochiya]], and [[Youmu Konpaku]] to investigate. Due to various misunderstandings and a general worry of someone weird or dangerous being resurrected, combat broke out, but afterwards there were no hard feelings and Toyosatomimi and her followers found that they enjoyed the thrilling combat. The now-revived "residents" of the Mausoleum appear to have been pacified for the moment.

===Spin-offs===
The mausoleum was used as a [[stage]] location in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'' and ''[[Urban Legend in Limbo]]'', associated with [[Mononobe no Futo]].

{{nihongo|'''Heaven'''|天界|Tenkai|lit. Celestial World}} is a collection of separate realms existing above the Earth. One of them, {{nihongo|Bhavaagra|有頂天|Uchouten|lit. Summit of the existent world}}, is the setting of most final battles in ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]'', and can be reached by climbing the [[Youkai Mountain]]. Bhavaagra is also where [[Tenshi Hinanawi]] and her family live. [[Suika Ibuki]] may occasionally be seen there as well.

==General Information==
Those who have achieved nirvana in the cycle of reincarnation or are judged worthy by the [[Yama]] may ascend to Heaven. In recent times, access via nirvana has been put on hold, with the official statement from Heaven being that the realm has become overcrowded and can no longer hold any more people.&lt;ref&gt;[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]: [[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Yuyuko Saigyouji|Yuyuko]] — "As the heavens receive all those who have broken from the cycle of transmigration, they've reached their capacity."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Immaterial and Missing Power]]: [[Immaterial and Missing Power/Story/Sakuya's Scenario|Sakuya's Scenario]] — [[Youmu Konpaku|Youmu]]: "Nirvana is currently forbidden. Heaven is saturated now."&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Yukari Yakumo]] has stated that this a lie, and that there is still plenty of free space in Heaven.&lt;ref&gt;[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]: [[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody/Story/Yukari's Scenario|Yukari's Scenario]] — "The heavens use the lands too luxuriously. They say the heavens is too saturated so nirvana is forbidden... What a big lie. They just hate small spaces, that's all... The [[celestials]] being people who left their worldliness behind is also a big lie. Heaven is, in fact, the hive for these sly people."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Celestial]]s, Angels, and other heavenly beings reside there. These residents generally live carefree lives filled with fishing, song, dance, sake, and peaches. They may also find enjoyment in viewing events that unfold on the Earth.

===History===
It's claimed by [[Eirin Yagokoro]] that long ago, Heaven itself was a giant [[keystone]] on Earth. When the keystone was pulled out, the planet was devastated and all life on it perished as a consequence.&lt;ref&gt;[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]: [[Reisen Udongein Inaba|Reisen]]'s Ending — Eirin: "When that keystone was pulled out to create heaven, all creatures on earth perished."&lt;/ref&gt; This event occurred so long ago that even some of the oldest known beings such as Eirin had not yet been born.&lt;ref&gt;[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]: Reisen's Ending — "Master, did you see that happen...?" "Of course not. This was a very long time ago." The keystone was pulled out before Eirin's time. Eirin has been even alive before [[Lord Tsukuyomi]]. Lord Tsukuyomi was the founder of the Moon capital hundreds of millions of years ago. (Note: the statement that the lunar capital was founded hundreds of millions of years ago was made while ZUN was drunk, so this there does remain some doubt about it)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Terminology===
In Buddhist terminology, "Bhavaagra" has pretty much the same meaning as "Sphere of Neither Perception nor Non-perception". The characters {{lang|ja|有頂天}} is a translation from Sanskrit of "Bhavaagra" ({{lang|sa|भवाग्र}}), and literally means "summit of the existent world." (Furthermore, the transliteration of Sanskrit generally does not use hyphens, so "Bhava-agra" is not quite correct even though it is used often, and "Bhavāgra" is not accurate either.) Furthermore, since it is a summary saying "the highest", this word is frequently colloquially used to mean "to reach the summit and forget the self, riding with the flow" (Japanese-English dictionaries commonly list this as "ecstasy").

According to the [[wikipedia:Buddhist cosmology|cosmology of Buddhism]], in the worlds known as the "three realms", the highest is the "formless realm", and even higher is the territory called the "sphere of neither perception nor non-perception". The three realms, in the order of abandoning desire, are split into the desire realm, the form realm, and the formless realm.
*The [[wikipedia:Desire realm|desire realm]] (kāmadhātu) is the world in which live those who have still not arrested their appetite, lust and other ordinary desires.
*The [[wikipedia:Buddhist cosmology#Form Realm (Rūpadhātu)|form realm]] (rūpadhātu) is the world in which live those who are at the stage of having abandoned ordinary desires, but are still bound by the general physical notions of time and body.
*The [[wikipedia:Formless Realm|formless realm]] (ārūpyadhātu) is the world in which live those who have broken out of the bounds of physical things like body etc. and exist only in thought and spirit.

This "formless realm" is the world of those who operate only by thought and spirit, but since thoughts remain, it does not mean that they have abandoned all worldly desires. It is further split into stages according to differences in the condition of abandoning worldly desires, and have pretty much completed the abandonment of all worldly desire (non-perception), but since just a little remains, it also indicates that it is not perfect (non-non-perception). Although it is not perfect, it is, for once, the highest.

Furthermore, it can be known as it is seen, but even as [[Tenshi Hinanawi]] has abandoned worldly desire, it does not mean she has abandoned her body. That said, in [[Gensokyo]], as there is only power to remove interference from flying [[youkai]] and [[celestial]]s, it is possible to break in with one's own power in living flesh.

Incidentally, in the cosmology of Buddhism, the phrase {{nihongo||非想非非想処|hisou-hihisou-sho}} is generally more used than {{nihongo||非想非非想天|hisou-hihisou-ten}} in its Japanese translation, and when written out in Sanskrit where it came from, it is "{{lang|sa|नैवसंज्ञानासंज्ञायतन}}" (''naivasaṃjñānāsaṃjñāyatana''). Meanwhile, even as the Han characters ({{lang|ja|非想非非想天}}) are freely used on the internet, it may just be something that propagated through the countries that use Han characters and then translated back into its original language, but if written out in Sanskrit, it would be "{{lang|sa|नैवसंज्ञानासंज्ञादेवलोक}}" (''naivasaṃjñānāsaṃjñādēvalōka'').

}}{{Distinguish|Former Hell}}
{{nihongo|'''Hell'''|地獄|Jigoku}}, also {{nihongo|'''New Hell'''|新地獄|Shin Jigoku}}&lt;ref name="HSTSSui" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SoPmPrt4" /&gt;, is a collection of realms seperate from [[Gensokyo]] where sinful souls are imprisoned.&lt;ref name="SoPmPrt4" /&gt; It is not to be confused with [[Former Hell]], the previous location of Gensokyo's own Hell, or [[Makai]], a similarly hellish realm filled with [[demon|demons]]. 

==General Information==
Hell is a collection of different realms of the afterlife where one's soul is condemned to be imprisoned and tortured. [[wikipedia:Avīci_|Avici]] is one of many such realms, as was [[Former Hell]] in the past. Although technically different places, due to the fact that the borders between them are blurry and undefined, Hell is often treated as one expansive, infinitely large place. Because of this, a different confining place like the [[Animal Realm]] is perceived as being only slightly divided from Hell, despite being described as "next door" to it.&lt;ref&gt; [[Strange Creators of Outer World/Wily Beast and Weakest Creature Interview with ZUN|Strange Creators of Outer World]] - Wily Beast and Weakest Creature Interview with ZUN&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, each world has it's own Hell and every Hell is managed by a coalition of [[yama]] and [[kishin]] called [[Perfect_Memento_in_Strict_Sense/Yama#The_Ministry_of_Right_and_Wrong|The Ministry of Right and Wrong]]. Hell is one of many realms of the afterlife one may go to after being judged by a yama at [[Higan]], with the other two major realms being [[Heaven]] and the [[Netherworld]]. 

===Basis===
The hell of Japanese mythology (地獄 ''Jigoku'' lit. "Earth Prison") is based on the Chinese mythological realm of the same name, pronounced "[[wikipedia:Diyu|Diyu]]" and is not to be confused with the [[Shinto]] underworld, [[wikipedia:Yomi]]. Both hells are syntheses of the Buddhist [[wikipedia:Naraka_(Buddhism)|Naraka]], itself based on the Hindu [[wikipedia:Naraka_(Hinduism)|Naraka]], with traditional, pre-Buddhist beliefs. In Japan's tradition, souls must cross the [[wikipedia:Sanzu_River|Sanzu River]] to be judged at Higan. Souls are judged by ten judges known as the [https://www.onmarkproductions.com/html/sai-no-kawara.html#10kings Ten Kings of Hell] and are accordingly sent to whatever realm their lives' actions deserved. The main paths of the afterlife one may be sent to are called the [https://www.onmarkproductions.com/html/six-states.shtml Six Realms]. Hell is the lowest realm, being succeeded by the [[wikipedia:Preta|Preta]] Realm, Animal Realm, Human Realm, [[wikipedia:Asura_(Buddhism)|Asura]] Realm and [[wikipedia:Deva_(Buddhism)|Deva]] Realm, also known as Heaven. There are many Hells within Hell in Buddhism, with each having a specialized torture suited for every particular kind of sinner. One's time in Hell, as in the other five realms, is not eternal, however. It may take many millennia but souls eventually burn up all their negative karma and are reincarnated in a new realm, as is the eternal cycle of [[wikipedia:Samsara_(Buddhism)|Samsara]].

===Gensokyo's Hell===
Gensokyo's Hell was originally located in the [[Underworld]], in what is now called [[Former Hell]]. At an unknown time (possibly before the events of ''[[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]]''), Gensokyo's Hell moved into a new location due to over-population. [[Rin Kaenbyou]] stated that she's lived in Former Hell ever since it really was Hell.&lt;ref name="SARei&amp;Sui" /&gt; Because of the existence of Former Hell, the Gensokyo's current Hell is sometimes referred to as "New Hell".&lt;ref name="HSTSSui" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SoPmPrt4" /&gt; The New Hell is now located beyond Sai no Kawara, which is near the [[Sanzu River]].&lt;ref name="WBaWC" /&gt;

Gensokyo's current [[yama]] is a former [[Jizou|Jizo statue]] named [[Eiki Shiki]].&lt;ref name="PMiSSYama"&gt;''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'': [[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Yama|Yama]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shinigami]], who serve yama, are also known to operate in Hell and guide and explain the afterlife's details to the souls who are unfamiliar with its workings&lt;ref name="PMiSSShinigami"&gt;''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'': [[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Shinigami|Shinigami]]&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the [[Netherworld]], Hell is smaller,&lt;ref name="PMiSSYuyuko"&gt;''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'': [[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Yuyuko Saigyouji|Yuyuko Saigyouji]]&lt;/ref&gt; but apparently extremely spacious.&lt;ref name="SoPmSatori"&gt;''[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]]'': [[Symposium of Post-mysticism/Satori Komeiji|Satori Komeiji]]&lt;/ref&gt; It is also desolate and far from being calm.&lt;ref name="PMiSSNetherworld"&gt;''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'': [[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Netherworld|Netherworld]]&lt;/ref&gt; A wide array of torture devices are used to torture sinful souls, but there are current economic conditions that left many of these contraptions in serious need of maintenance and repair.&lt;ref name="PMiSSYama" /&gt;

Hell's facilities naturally must be expanded in order to accommodate the increasing population.&lt;ref name="PMiSSKomachi"&gt;''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'': [[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Komachi Onozuka|Komachi Onozuka]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to financing issues, Hell has reached the point where it could no longer sustain itself merely from the ferrying fees levied on the departed.&lt;ref name="PMiSSRoL"&gt;''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'': [[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Road of Liminality|Road of Liminality]]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the primary sources of income are fares from those crossing the Sanzu River, as well as concession stands and food carts operating on the [[Road of Liminality]] in an attempt to earn some more money.&lt;ref name="PMiSSYama" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PMiSSRoL" /&gt; Hell can receive some money even from both the dead who aren't going there and from the living. However, those who run the stands are all criminals who were sentenced to Hell, so it's said many fall victim to their tricks. But as soon as they're discovered, they're sent back to Hell. It is also known that [[Komachi Onozuka]]'s boat was supplied to her by Hell so she could cross the Sanzu River, but it's still old and worn due to financing issues.&lt;ref name="PMiSSKomachi" /&gt;



====Process====
Once a soul has finally made it across the [[Road of Liminality]] and the [[Sanzu River]] to [[Higan]], they'll wait there to be judged. Once they've been finally judged by the yama and are sent to Hell, the soul will fall outside the cycle of reincarnation temporarily. On their journey, the [[kishin]] chiefs will take charge as the souls fall down to Hell and will command the lesser [[oni]] to torment them.&lt;ref name="PMiSSYama" /&gt; [[Komachi Onozuka]] mentions that the oni of Hell are disciplined and injustices is quite rare, while the oni of [[Former Hell]] have too many close relationships with the ghosts of sinners, making them forgo their jobs Hell and choosing to stay in Former Hell.&lt;ref name="HSTSKomachi"&gt;''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]'': [[Touhou Hisoutensoku/Translation/Komachi's Script|Komachi's Script]]&lt;/ref&gt; Every hundred years, [[assassin]]s from Hell will come to the surface to try and assassinate impious [[hermit]]s and [[celestial]]s. This is because extending life past normal mortality is considered a sin. It's necessary for those extending their lives to perform pious acts to compensate for it.&lt;ref name="PMiSSHermits"&gt;''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'': [[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Hermits|Hermits]]&lt;/ref&gt; This happened to [[Seiga Kaku]] in ''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'' chapter 12, where a kishin chief named [[Suiki]] was sent to assassinate her.

In order to avoid going to Hell in the afterlife, one must simply not commit sin during their life. Even committing suicide will send you to Hell.&lt;ref name="BAiJRHakugyokurou"&gt;''[[Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red]]'': [[Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red/Hakugyokurou|Hakugyokurou]]&lt;/ref&gt; Even in her free time, Eiki has an habit of lecturing people in the hopes that they will change for the better so she won't have to send them to Hell, as shown in ''[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]''. It's suggested from the game that even though you've sinned, you can still redeem yourself by changing your lifestyle, thus not going to Hell. Eiki says that Hell doesn't exist to punish sinners, but to ensure that nobody sins.&lt;ref name="PoFVMarisa"&gt;''[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]'': [[Phantasmagoria of Flower View/Story/Marisa's Scenario|Marisa's Scenario]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yuyuko Saigyouji]]'s ability to manipulate departed souls enables her to control [[ghost]]s and spirits, making her able to let those from Hell stay eternally in the Netherworld. However, Yuyuko could also send a soul from the Netherworld to Hell by commanding her servant [[Youmu Konpaku]] to sever the circle of transmigration with her sword, sending it back to [[Higan]], making it very likely that the soul will go to Hell.&lt;ref name="PMiSSYuyuko" /&gt;

According to Hecatia Laspislazuli, Hell wasn't always a place that served to rehabilitate human criminals. It was originally created by ''people unaccustomed to living virtuously, people with hearts of pure evil, and valorous people who seek true freedom'', and was meant to be a place for them to live however they wanted, with no concept of being a bother to others. Things like the Lake of Blood or the Sea of Fire were used for personal pleasures like drinking and roasting meat rather than as a punishment. This changed when the [[yama]] and kishin took over, trying to create order in such a chaotic world, saying they'd bring Hell back to its former glory. Despite this, Hell continues to be what can be considered a world of pure freedom run by an absolutely meritocratic system, where it doesn't matter who one is as long as they have the power to back it up, making it possible for even fairies to become important if they get the job done. Likewise, this also makes it possible for even kishin to become irrelevant with just one failure.&lt;ref&gt; [[Alternative Facts in Eastern Utopia]] - Interview with Hecatia Lapislazuli&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-Gensokyo Hells===
According to [[Hecatia Lapislazuli]]'s official profile in ''[[Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom]]'', she is the [[God|Goddess]] of Hell and there's a Hell for Earth, the [[Moon]] and the Otherworlds, and she governs all of them, being at the top of the Ministry of Right and Wrong. Not much is known about these Hells. She holds a grudge against [[Chang'e]] because her husband, Houyi, shot down her suns, taking away the light Hell needs to exist, because without it, there would be no shadows and the place would become weak. [[Fairy|Fairies]] are known to be found anywhere and Hell is not an exception. They, along with [[Clownpiece]], originally come from Earth's Hell and were, under Hecatia's orders, immigrated to the [[Sea of Tranquility]] on the Moon in order to threaten the [[Lunar Capital]]. The Capital then temporarily became a fairy paradise that was said to be more comfortable than Hell, suggesting how awful the environment in Hell is. These fairies were transformed into pure lifeforce by [[Junko]] in order to accomplish this. According to Clownpiece, these refined fairies' energies exceeds even that of a [[kishin]].&lt;ref name="LoLKReisen"&gt;''[[Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom]]'': [[Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom/Story/Reisen's Scenario|Reisen's Scenario]]. It is currently unknown if Earth's Hell is the same as Gensokyo's Hell.&lt;/ref&gt;

===PC-98 games===
;''Highly Responsive to Prayers''
Hell first appeared in ''[[Highly Responsive to Prayers]]'', with a gate located not far from the [[Hakurei Shrine]] that leads to it. Hell serves as the location of the second route of the game (the first being [[Makai]]), choosable after defeating [[SinGyoku]], the [[Stage]] 5 [[boss]]. The game shows three places - {{nihongo|Hokora&lt;ref name="HRtPEnding"&gt;''[[Highly Responsive to Prayers]]'': Endings&lt;/ref&gt;|祠}}, where [[Mima]] presumably originated as an [[evil spirit]], the {{nihongo|Rotting World of Flames&lt;ref name="HRtPEnding" /&gt;|炎の腐界|Honoo no Fukai}} where [[Kikuri]] appears, and the {{nihongo|Silent Temple&lt;ref name="HRtPEnding"/&gt;|静かなる神殿|Shizukanaru Shinden}} where [[Konngara]] resides.

===Windows games===
;''Wily Beast and Weakest Creature''
Hell serves as one of the focal points of the game's story, due to Hell's internal strife, the animal spirits were able to reach the surface from the Animal Realm by going through Hell. Hell is where [[Yachie Kicchou]] directed the protagonists towards the animal realm as a part of her scheme to defeat [[Keiki Haniyasushin]]. The protagonists also fought [[Saki Kurokoma]] in a particularly stormy area in Hell in an attempt to prevent her from conquering the surface.

==Additional Information==
*Even though a vast amount of information is provided about Hell that's spread throughout the ''[[Touhou Project]]'', it was not given a centred article in ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]''.
*The [[Dragon (Species)|dragon deities]] can freely travel to Hell, the Netherworld and the Outside World.&lt;ref name="PMiSSDragon"&gt;''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'': [[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Dragon|Dragons]]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Sakuya Izayoi]] suggests that [[Makai]] is scarier than Hell,&lt;ref name="PCBSakuyaEX"&gt;''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]'': [[Perfect Cherry Blossom/Story/Sakuya's Extra|Sakuya's Extra Scenario]]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Remilia Scarlet]] claims that not even the fires of Hell could burn her body,&lt;ref name="SaBNDCh15"&gt;''[[Strange and Bright Nature Deity]]: Chapter 15&lt;/ref&gt; even though she's a [[vampire]].
*[[Hieda no Akyuu]] once worked for the [[yama]] for a hundred years in Hell when one of her next reincarnations was preparing.&lt;ref name="PMiSSMonologue"&gt;''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'': [[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Monologue|Monologue]]&lt;/ref&gt;
*It should be noted that recurringly in the ''[[Touhou Project]]'', primarily in ''[[Subterranean Animism]]'', various characters will make use of the proper noun "Hell" when they actually mean "[[Former Hell]]". This was pointed out by Akyuu in ''[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]]'' [[Symposium of Post-mysticism/Part 4|Part 4]].&lt;ref name="SoPmPrt4" /&gt;

'''Higan''' ({{lang|ja|彼岸}}) is the far side of the [[Sanzu River]], where deceased souls wait for their turn to be judged by the [[Yama]]. As a [[Pure Land]], it has no weather, no seasons, and no night and day-- just an endless flower garden with a gentle warmth. It is strictly not part of [[Gensokyo]].

==General Information==
Souls of the deceased will wait at the Shigan ({{lang|ja|此岸}}) (''the shore of the living world'') of the Sanzu River for a [[Shinigami]] to ferry them one at a time. As one gets to the Higan side, there is nothing to do but silently wait and contemplate death until the [[Yama]] is ready to pass judgement. The yama, who can see the souls' past, will judge whether they should go to the [[Netherworld]], [[Heaven]], [[Hell]], or be reincarnated. If it's Hell, then the soul will fall outside the cycle of reincarnation temporarily.

The word "Higan" is composed of the kanji for ''that'' or ''over there'' ({{lang|ja|彼}}) and ''shore'' ({{lang|ja|岸}}), so its literal meaning is "that shore" or "the shore on the other side". The Shigan ({{lang|ja|此岸}}), which is located on the opposite end to the Higan, can literally mean ''this shore'' or ''the shore on this side'' as well. Both of these term originate in Japanese Buddhism. 

===Basis===

==Higan's Appearances==
;Wily Beast and Weakest Creature
''[[Wily Beast and Weakest Creature]]'' marked Higan's first in-game appearance, as the protagonist crosses through it to reach [[Hell]]. They're warned of the danger ahead and fought by [[Kutaka Niwatari]], though only as a precaution, as she was already authorized to let them pass.

The {{Nihongo|'''Hill of the Nameless'''|無名の丘|Mumei no Oka}} is a meadow full of purple and white [[wikipedia:Lily of the Valley|lilies-of-the-valley]] on a mountain opposite [[Youkai Mountain]]. In the past, it was used as a place to abandon children who then later either died from the poison of the lilies or were abducted by [[youkai]]. It is somehow hidden away from the [[Human Village]].

==General Information==
Not much is known about the location. The {{nihongo|"Nameless"|無名}} part is derived from the nameless children who were abandoned at the hill to be killed by the flowers there, only to be collected later by [[youkai]]. However, there are legends that some of the children were abducted and raised by mischievous youkai. Stories have been told that parents who did not want to see their own children die left them here in the hope that they can live with the youkai. It's believed that, because of these stories, people don't come here, not even youkai. It is believed to be the place where [[Medicine Melancholy]] came into being. The threat level of this place is 'Medium' and [[Fairy|fairies]] and [[phantom]]s can typically be encountered here. The place seems to not get much direct sunlight and is fairly windy, so this place may not be warm at times.

==The Hill's Appearance==
===Games===
;''Phantasmagoria of Flower View''
The hill appeared as a stage location in ''[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]'', in which it's the location for [[Medicine Melancholy]]. The stage generally appears on stage 7 in some scenarios of the game. Various characters will come here to look for leads towards the flower incident, only to find and defeat Medicine.

===Spin-offs===
;''Shoot the Bullet
The hill appears on [[stage]] 4 of ''[[Shoot the Bullet]]'', where [[Aya Shameimaru]] encounters [[Reisen Udongein Inaba]], [[Medicine Melancholy]] and [[Tewi Inaba]] to try and take photos of their [[danmaku]]. There are 9 scenes in this stage, and it is the only stage in the game, apart for the Extra stage, to contain an extra character. The previous stage was at the [[Giant Toad's Pond]] at the [[Youkai Mountain]], whilst the next stage is at the [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]].

{{nihongo|'''Former Hell's Hot Spring Town'''|旧地獄温泉街|Kyū-jigoku onsen-gai}} is a resort district in [[Former Hell]], deep within the [[Underworld]]. It is accessible from the [[Rainbow Cavern of Earth Spirits]], and managed by [[Yuugi Hoshiguma]].

==General Information==
The buildings are tall and densely-packed, and appear to be modelled after traditional Japanese houses. What appears to be steam or hot water continually pours down from above. The buildings are interspersed with large hot springs, in which [[oni]] and [[vengeful spirit|vengeful spirits]] can be seen bathing.

==Town's Appearances==
===Games===
;''Touhou Gouyoku Ibun''
The town first appeared in ''[[Touhou Gouyoku Ibun]]'', where it serves as the location of [[Reimu Hakurei]] and [[Marisa Kirisame]]'s third [[Stage]]. Both encounter [[Yuugi Hoshiguma]], who informs them that a large deposit of petroleum is located below the town, but proceeds to engage them in combat to ward them away from it.

The {{nihongo|'''Human Village'''|人間の里|Ningen no Sato}} is where most of [[Gensokyo]]'s [[human]]s live. Even though some [[youkai]] also visit here to shop, this is the safest place in all of Gensokyo to live. Humans from the [[outside world]] that stumble into Gensokyo and decide to stay often have no choice but to live here as they would be unable to handle the youkai outside the village. The village itself has a powerful protector in [[Keine Kamishirasawa]], who is capable of "hiding" the history of the village's existence for its protection.

==General Information==
[[File:PMiSS humanvillage.jpg|thumb|left|175px|The village in ''[[PMiSS]]'']]
When people talk about a "village", the word refers to the Human Village because there is only one in [[Gensokyo]].

===Geography and People===
Among the people living at the village are [[Keine Kamishirasawa]] and [[Hieda no Akyuu]]. The village has an as of yet unnamed leader, a florist, a woodcutter, a teahouse, a tofu shop, youkai exterminators, and more.&lt;ref&gt;''{{PMiSS|Perfect Memento in Strict Sense}}'' Eyewitness reports: Keine Kamishirasawa, Luna Child, Ran Yakumo, Human village&lt;/ref&gt; There's also the Kirisame-ya second-hand shop here which is owned by [[Marisa Kirisame|Marisa]]'s [[Marisa's unnamed father|father]]. Some stores stay open late into the night to cater exclusively to youkai&lt;ref&gt;{{PMiSS|Page|Human Village}} "many stores are kept open late at night, but that is when they are for the exclusive use of youkai"&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Most of the furniture in the [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]] was made by humans in this village, and [[Sakuya Izayoi]] comes to shop often. [[Yuuka Kazami]] has come to shop at the flower shop on at least one occasion. [[Ran Yakumo]] is a frequent customer of the village tofu shop, and also checks up on the village occasionally for her master [[Yukari Yakumo]]. [[Reisen Udongein Inaba]] travels to the village to sell medicine, though she is forced to do so in human disguise.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Forbidden Scrollery]]'' chapter 21&lt;/ref&gt; It is said that [[Medicine Melancholy]] once tried to spread poison across the village. [[Kogasa Tatara]] is often sighted in the village, where she is disliked by adults but loved by children (to her dismay).

A number of households possess resident [[zashiki-warashi]], who are adored by humans but secretly act as spies for the other youkai. They were briefly replaced by [[hobgoblin]]s during the events of ''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'', who failed to achieve the same level of popularity.

[[Myouren Temple]] was constructed near the village after the events of ''[[Undefined Fantastic Object]]''.

According to [[Sanae Kochiya]], the village has a relatively central geographical location in [[Gensokyo]]

===The Village and Youkai===
Officially, [[youkai]] do not meddle in village affairs, and villagers tend to be uncomfortable with youkai walking the streets unless they have good reason to be there. Below the surface there are many youkai who visit the village in disguise, or compete to gain influence over it ([[Mamizou Futatsuiwa]] being a notable example), but anything which would actually cause the villagers trouble is out of bounds. Some disguised youkai, like [[Sekibanki]], actually live in the village. Youkai seek to avoid anything which would cause Gensokyo's human population to rally around a strong leader and directly challenge their authority over Gensokyo.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Forbidden Scrollery]]'' chapter 32&lt;/ref&gt;

Humans from the village mostly avoid involving themselves in youkai actvities, although some humans have become uneasy with the dominance of youkai in Gensokyo. In the recent past, a secret society was rumored to have existed, intending to learn secrets from research into the beginnings of human and youkai residence in Gensokyo with a goal of asserting human control and expelling youkai from the land.

==Sub-Locations==
[[File:HV School.png|thumb|200px|Hieda Temple School in the Human Village as seen in ''[[Forbidden Scrollery]]''.]]
Some notable locations within the Human Village:

===Dragon Statue===
A statue of the [[Dragon God]] serves as one of the village's more notable landmarks. Built by [[kappa]], its eyes can predict the weather by changing colour, and are said to turn red before an [[incident]].

===Hieda House===
[[Hieda no Akyuu]] lives here, recording everything that she has seen in her life. Her family appears to be one of the wealthiest in the village, with several house-servants&lt;ref&gt;''[[Memorizable Gensokyo]]''&lt;/ref&gt; and a sizable vegetable garden&lt;ref&gt;''[[Forbidden Scrollery]]'' chapter 13&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Kappa Warehouse===
An abandoned building at the edge of the village was once used by the [[kappa]] for storage while their normal warehouse was frozen over.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Forbidden Scrollery]]'' chapters 14-15&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kirisame-ya Second-Hand Shop===
[[Marisa's unnamed father|Marisa's father]] is the owner of this shop. [[Rinnosuke Morichika]] was his former apprentice here, but nothing much is known here beyond that it does not deal in magic items.&lt;ref&gt;{{PMiSS|Page|Marisa Kirisame}} "As this is a private matter the details are unclear, but it may be related to the fact that the Kirisame family doesn't deal in magical items."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roadside Shrines===
The village possesses a ''hokora'' dedicated [[wikipedia:Inari shrine|to the Shinto god Inari]], which an [[Unnamed Evil Dragon]] claims to have constructed long ago.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Forbidden Scrollery]]'' chapters 8-9&lt;/ref&gt; During the events of ''[[Forbidden Scrollery]]'' chapter 23, the [[Moriya Shrine]] erects a number of its own ''hokora'' around the outskirts of the village, encouraging villagers to leave offerings in order to ward off a recent series of snake attacks.

===Hieda Temple School===
There is a [[wikipedia:terakoya|Terakoya]] somewhere in the village, where Keine works as a history teacher. Planning for its construction began in the [[Gensokyo Timeline|117th Season]]&lt;ref&gt;{{BAiJR|Page|Keine}} The 117th Season, Nagatsuki 2. "If dangerous ideas are formed from this society because the humans have not passed on their history to their descendants, she said she has considered opening a history school."&lt;/ref&gt;. Known students include the village chief's son, the florist's daughter, and [[Minor Characters#Unnamed_Fox_student|a disguised Kitsune]]&lt;ref&gt;''[[Forbidden Scrollery]]'' Chapters 18-19&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Suzunaan===
:''Main article: [[Suzunaan]]''
The book renting shop where [[Kosuzu Motoori]] works.

===Geidontei===
:''Main article: [[Geidontei]]''
A traditional Japanese-styled bar. [[Miyoi Okunoda]] works here.

==The Human Village's Appearances==
===PC-98===
;''Highly Responsive to Prayers''
The Human Village was first referenced in the [[PC-98]] game ''[[Highly Responsive to Prayers]]'', where [[youkai]] and [[demon]]s were after the village to destroy it. In the game, it had the kanji "{{lang|ja|人里}}" (''Hitozato'') and was set in the [[Eastern Country]]. There hasn't been any evidence however that the Human Village in the PC-98 and [[Windows]] era are the same location.

===Windows===
;''Imperishable Night''
After many years since it was first mentioned, the Human Village became the setting for [[stage]] 3 of ''[[Imperishable Night]]''. Fearing that youkai would take advantage of the endless night to launch an attack, [[Keine Kamishirasawa]] hid away the village's history, disguising it as a patch of uninhabited wilderness.

;''Hopeless Masquerade''
The village appears as a [[stage]] location in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]''. The events started off by [[Hata no Kokoro]] losing control of her component masks, causing her to leech emotions from the Human Village. In response, Gensokyo's religious leaders set out to restore the villagers' hope through spirituality and exciting battles. Two playable stages are set in the village: a daytime stage featuring a variety of human and youkai spectators, and a night stage used for the final battle against Kokoro.

;''Urban Legend in Limbo''
The village returns as a stage location associated with [[Hata no Kokoro]]. Only the night version from the previous game is shown.

;''Antinomy of Common Flowers''
The village returns once again as a stage location associated with [[Hata no Kokoro]]. Both the day and night versions from ''Hopeless Masquerade'' are shown.

The {{nihongo|'''Komakusa Gambling Den'''|駒草の賭場}} is a casino owned by [[Sannyo Komakusa]].


==General Information==
The gambling den is located on [[Youkai Mountain]] cliffs such as the [[False Heaven Shelf]],  and it only opens on specific days. The den constantly rotates locations among the various abandoned buildings found there, with its current location being signified by a dragon pipe hanging in front of it. &lt;ref&gt;[[Lotus Eaters]] - Chapter 29&lt;/ref&gt; Regular patrons of the den are mountain youkai such as [[kappa]], [[tengu]], and [[yamawaro]].

Sannyo constantly fills the place with smoke produced by 100-percent natural Youkai Mountain tobacco, in order to influence to behavior of its guests and prevent the kinds of frenzies that tend to break out in other gambling dens. It's because of this smoke that the den is considered a fine and gentlemanly recreational spot.&lt;ref&gt;[[Unconnected Marketeers]] - Sannyo Komakusa's profile&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearances== 

===Literature=== 
;[[Lotus Eaters]]
[[Mamizou Futatsuiwa]] heads to the den after having heard about it from [[Aya Shameimaru]], once inside the den, dozens of [[Tengu]], [[Kappa]], and [[Yamawaro]] can be observed gambling via various games.
Mamizou decides to play a game of [[Wikipedia:Cee-lo|Cee-lo]] with a group of yamawaro, she wins every round through cheating. Sannyo, suspecting this, invites Mamizou to play a game of Odds-or-evens, in which she ends up losing due to her being unable to cheat at that.

{{nihongo|'''Kourindou'''|香霖堂}} is an antique store seated between the [[Human Village]] and the [[Forest of Magic]], run by [[Rinnosuke Morichika]]. 

==General Information==
[[File:PMiSS kourindou.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Kourindou in ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'']]
The store is Rinnosuke's home. Although it's a somewhat well-known establishment for the residents of [[Gensokyo]], Rinnosuke rarely (if ever) actually sells anything, despite keeping an exhaustive inventory; he mostly trades and/or puts up with "creative borrowing" from [[Reimu Hakurei]] and [[Marisa Kirisame]]. The store doesn't get very many customers aside from the usual noisy ones. Mold often grows in the store, as well, which may contribute to this.

On occasion, the store is used for completely non-business ventures, such as cooking and combat. The store has also taken quite a bit of damage over time, thanks to conflicts that involve the store's occupants.

The inventory of Kourindou is (presumably) its main draw, as it mostly includes items from the [[outside world]]. Teacups, feather pillows, computing magazines, [[wikipedia:Kerosene heater|kerosene/paraffin heaters]], and even an [[wikipedia:iPod|iPod]] have made their way there over time.

==Kourindou's Appearances==
===Windows===
[[Marisa Kirisame]] has mentioned the shop to [[Reimu Hakurei]] in the Match Mode of ''[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]''. Also, in [[Undefined Fantastic Object/Story/Sanae B's Scenario|Sanae B's scenario]] in ''[[Undefined Fantastic Object]]'', [[Nazrin]] mentions a second-hand shop where she acquired the jeweled pagoda, which is likely Kourindou.

===Spin-offs===
;''Urban Legend in Limbo''
For the first time, the shop is a [[stage]] location in ''[[Urban Legend in Limbo]]'', associated to [[Marisa Kirisame]]. Even though it's in this game, Rinnosuke does not appear.

The '''Lake of Blood''' is a lake in the mountains that appears to be filled with pure blood, rather than water. It appears in the second stage of [[Lotus Land Story]]. Within it lies the entrance to [[Mugenkan]].

==General Information==
[[Kurumi]] is the [[gatekeeper]] of the entrance to the lake. [[Elly]] stands guard within the lake, at the border between [[Gensokyo]] and the [[Fantasy World]], protecting the entrance to Mugenkan. On stage 2 of ''[[Lotus Land Story]]'', a whole lake appears to be made of blood. It even has rocks in it. After [[Kurumi]] made her appearance as the midboss of that stage, the background then appears to be black and several rocks wrapped in shimenawa ropes have lined up. The manual states that stage 3 is within the lake after its water has drained out.

==Lake's Appearance==
;''Lotus Land Story''
[[Reimu Hakurei]] and [[Marisa Kirisame]] must pass the Lake of Blood to get to [[Mugenkan]], defeating [[Kurumi]] in the process.

The {{nihongo|'''Land of the Back Door'''|後戸の国|Ushirodo no Kuni}} is an extradimensional location ruled by [[Okina Matara]] which first appeared in ''[[Hidden Star in Four Seasons]]''.

The area is a seemingly endless plane of floating doors which lead to different locations in [[Gensokyo]]. Not much is known about the place other than that it seems to have been created by Okina.

===Games=== 

;[[Hidden Star in Four Seasons]]
During the four seasons incident, the protagonist ends up in the Land of the Back door after climbing through a backdoor on [[Narumi Yatadera]]'s back, or as in Cirno's case, climbed through a back door on her own back. They are attacked by [[Satono Nishida]] and [[Mai Teireida]].
After the protagonist defeats both, they proceed even further until they meet [[Okina Matara]], after shortly which a fight ensues, and all the protagonists end up losing to Okina Matara due to a trap that she has laid, which expelled them back into Gensokyo.

After their defeat against Okina Matara, they return for a rematch in the Extra Stage.

The {{nihongo|'''Lunar Capital'''|月の都|Tsuki no Miyako}}, or {{nihongo|'''Lunatic Kingdom'''|ルナティックキングダム|Runatikku Kingudamu}}, is a thriving, ancient metropolis and currently the only known one on the [[Moon]], located on the far side of it.&lt;ref name="PMiSSCapital"&gt;[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Lunar Capital|Perfect Memento in Strict Sense: Lunar Capital]]&lt;/ref&gt; With its civilisation mostly having [[lunarian]]s and [[moon rabbit]]s, its technology and weaponry is known to be far more advanced than that of the [[Outside World]]. The founder and lord of the capital is [[Lord Tsukuyomi]]. The Lunar Capital is also the legendary {{nihongo|'''Dragon Palace'''|竜宮|Ryūgū}},&lt;ref&gt;[[Symposium of Post-mysticism/Interview|Symposium of Post-mysticism - Interview]] - '''ZUN:''' Oh yeah, Iku's species is not written as "Messenger of the Dragon Palace" in katakana, but in kanji, and the Dragon Palace really does exist. Although it's actually the Lunar Capital.&lt;/ref&gt; also called the {{nihongo|'''Dragon King's Palace'''|竜宮城|Ryūgū-jō}}, that [[Mizue no Uranoshimako]] managed to reach,&lt;ref name="CiLRCh3"&gt;[[Cage in Lunatic Runagate/Third Chapter|Cage in Lunatic Runagate: Third Chapter]]&lt;/ref&gt; but it doesn't seem to be common knowledge since characters such as [[Rinnosuke Morichika]] still think of the Dragon Palace as a completely different place on the bottom of the sea.&lt;ref&gt;[[Curiosities of Lotus Asia/Chapter 15|Curiosities of Lotus Asia - Chapter 15]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==General Information==
[[File:SSiB7 MoonPalace.jpg|thumb|left|120px|The Moon Palace Gate in ''[[Silent Sinner in Blue]]'']]
The capital is protected by a barrier that hides its existence.&lt;ref name="CiLRCh3"/&gt; This barrier blocks outside access, but can be bypassed through the seas of the Moon. The Lunar Capital's relationship to the [[Moon]] is like [[Gensokyo]]'s to the Earth, also known as the [[Outside World]]&lt;ref name="SSiBCh6"&gt;[[Silent Sinner in Blue]] Chapter 6. "The Lunar Capital has the same relationship to the rest of the Moon as Gensokyo has to Earth.&lt;/ref&gt;, presumably because of this barrier. Like Gensokyo, it thus could effectively be considered another world. The capital is shown to have skyscrapers&lt;ref name="PMiSSCapital" /&gt; and traditional Japanese buildings.&lt;ref name="SSiBCh6"/&gt;

The majority of Gensokyo's inhabitants are well aware of the existence of the Lunar Capital. It's even recorded that the two used to have relations, although they ended long ago at an unknown point in time&lt;ref name="PMiSSKaguya"&gt;[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Kaguya Houraisan|Perfect Memento in Strict Sense: Kaguya Houraisan]]&lt;/ref&gt; Some records from the Genso-Lunar War are still intact which even go so far as to detail the weapons the lunarians had back then,&lt;ref name="PMiSSCapital" /&gt; and Lunar exhibitions from [[Eientei]] have kept the humans and [[youkai]] of Gensokyo updated a little on the Lunar Capital in the present day.

The majority of the Outside World, however, seem to be much less aware of it. As shown by the story of [[Mizue no Uranoshimako]], who was made to believe that he found the legendary Dragon Palace on the bottom of the sea,&lt;ref name="CiLRCh3"/&gt; the Lunarians are actively attempting to keep the existence of the Lunar Capital a secret to prevent the beings of the Earth from searching for it. There may, however, be some on Earth in the outside world in high places of authority who are aware of the Lunar Capital. The people from the Apollo missions were referred to as "[[assassin]]s" in ''[[Silent Sinner in Blue]]'', and there may have been ulterior motives to the cover up of the Earth's "defeat" in the Lunar War. However, for the public, any indication from the Earth's defeat in the Lunar War with the Apollo project that might have given clues to the Lunar Capital's existence were presumably covered up when only the successful landing on the Moon and not the "defeat" was reported to the public at large. For the second invasion (presumably the [[Wikipedia:Chang'e program|Chang'e program]]), allegedly either lunarians or moon rabbits made contact with the [[human]]s that landed on the Moon urging them to co-exist peacefully, but if so, it is likely this was concealed from the public too.&lt;ref name="INKaguyaProfile"&gt;''[[Imperishable Night]]'' Kaguya Houraisan's profile&lt;/ref&gt; Even in the near future of [[Maribel Hearn]] and [[Renko Usami]]'s time, the idea of a Lunar Capital is still just a legend,&lt;ref name="MAStory"&gt;[[Magical Astronomy/Story|Magical Astronomy's Story]]&lt;/ref&gt; although Maribel herself is able to see the Lunar Capital due to her ability to see through boundaries.

Although the Lunar Capital is protected by a barrier, things such as humans planting a flag on the Moon or colonizing it still presents a major problem for unspecified reasons. It is serious enough that humanity planting a flag and simply attempting to establish bases on the moon is referred to as the "Lunar War" and their failure to do so considered a "defeat". For both that past invasion and the one taking place in the present day, actual combat is being heavily considered due to humanity's attempts to establish bases on the Moon.&lt;ref name="INKaguyaProfile" /&gt; In the future, Maribel Hearn believes it's important she see the Lunar Capital before humanity manages to colonize the moon.&lt;ref name="MAStory" /&gt; The lunarians consider the Earth to be a residence for the corrupted, and it's said that they use the Earth as a prison for those who commit serious crimes, a prime example being [[Kaguya Houraisan]].

==Sub-Locations==
===Moon Palace===
The Moon Palace is the home of [[Watatsuki no Toyohime]], [[Watatsuki no Yorihime]] and [[Reisen]], having the [[Moon Capital Gate Guards]] guarding the entrance.

==Lunar Capital's Appearances==
===Games===
;''Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom''
A completely frozen Lunar Capital is the location of the Stage 4 of this game. This is due to [[Junko]] trying to siege the capital by adding the "Life and Death" concept to it, something that wasn't present on the Moon, making it ''pure''. This forced every resident of the Lunar Capital to flee to the [[Dream World]] and the Lunar Sages to take the decision to freeze it while [[Sagume]]'s plan was being executed.

===Literature===
[[File:SSiBCh6LunarCapital.jpg|thumb|220px|The capital in ''[[Silent Sinner in Blue]]'']]
;''Touhou Bougetsushou''
The Lunar Capital had an important role in the ''[[Touhou Bougetsushou]]'' series. After [[Reisen]] returned to the capital after meeting [[Eirin Yagokoro]], she wasn't allowed into the Moon Palace by the [[Moon Capital Gate Guards]], but [[Watatsuki no Toyohime]] jumps in and allows her access. Along with [[Watatsuki no Yorihime]], they were both given a letter by the rabbit with shocking news that Earthlings, particularly [[Reimu Hakurei]], [[Marisa Kirisame]], [[Remilia Scarlet]] and [[Sakuya Izayoi]], will invade the [[Moon]] at the sea. Yorihime left for their time of arrival. Also, Toyohime went and found [[Yukari Yakumo]] at the [[Bamboo Forest of the Lost]] to punish her, but had to go back to the Moon to take care of the intruders. During this event, it left their home empty, and thus [[Yuyuko Saigyouji]] and [[Youmu Konpaku]] managed to get to the Lunar Capital to steal something from their home, which turned out to be some sake. However, they cannot return to Earth until it's a full moon again after a month, but they were capable of going into hiding until Yukari can allow them access home.

{{nihongo|'''Makai'''|魔界||lit. "Demon World"}} is a world that exists seperate to [[Gensokyo]]. In the past works of [[PC-98]], it, along with all the beings that live here, were created by [[Shinki]]. It is not to be confused with {{nihongo|[[Hell]]|地獄|jigoku}} as it is not a place for the afterlife when [[phantom]]s are judged by the [[yama]] for their guilt, but instead it is merely a place where [[demon]]s and strong [[youkai]] live.

==General Information==
Makai's first initial appearance in the ''[[Touhou Project]]'' was in the first [[PC-98]] game ''[[Highly Responsive to Prayers]]'', where it is one of the main locations of the game. It then appeared as the prime location of ''[[Mystic Square]]'', where the player character will have an adventure through here. After many years of absence, Makai once again made a return in the [[Windows]] era as the location of Stages 5 and 6 in ''[[Undefined Fantastic Object]]'', and again a target location on Stages 7 and 12 in ''[[Double Spoiler]]''.

Due to the [[canon]]icity between the [[PC-98]] and the [[Windows]] era, Makai has somewhat mixed information. ZUN has stated that he wanted a "clean sweep" from the PC-98 when he was creating new games for Windows, but he also explicitly stated that the settings for the PC-98 and Windows are essentially the same,&lt;ref name="ZUNAWAQ&amp;AP"&gt;[[ZUN's AWA Q&amp;A Panel]]&lt;/ref&gt; thus Makai from both the PC-98 and Windows ought to also be the same. However, he does also say to take reference from the Windows era of the ''[[Touhou Project]]'' to consider what is canon. Hence, information is split into two as followed:

*In the [[PC-98]], the entrance to Makai is located in the mountains behind the [[Hakurei Shrine]],&lt;ref name="MSManual"&gt;[[Mystic Square]]: [[Mystic Square/Translation/Manual|Manual]]&lt;/ref&gt; called the {{nihongo|"Cave in Which the Door to Makai is Said to Be"&lt;ref name="MSManual" /&gt;|魔界の扉があるといわれる洞窟|Makai no Tobira ga Aru to Iwa reru Dōkutsu|actual name}}, where [[Reimu Hakurei]] wondered if there's a way to open its door. Passing through here will lead you to a border between Makai and the [[Gensokyo|Eastern Country]], which it's rather easy to cross. However, it was once said by [[Genjii]] that the [[World of Fantasies]] is the border between the Eastern Country and Makai,&lt;ref name="SoEWScenario"&gt;[[Story of Eastern Wonderland]]: [[Story of Eastern Wonderland/Story/Regular Stages|Main Scenario]]&lt;/ref&gt; and a portal appeared at the [[Hakurei Shrine]] in ''[[Highly Responsive to Prayers]]''.

:Makai was shown to have many [[demon]]s and even [[spirit]]s, where it was said that everything within Makai (including the residents) was created by [[Shinki]], the [[God]] of this world.&lt;ref name="MSReimu"&gt;[[Mystic Square]]: [[Mystic Square/Story/Reimu's Scenario|Reimu's Scenario]]&lt;/ref&gt; It is filled with gloom and darkness, where flying through here can give the feeling of being outer space, but there are also extensive fields of crystalline forests and frozen fields. There appears to be no natural material such as flowers. [[Louise]], a resident here, describes Makai as a "nice place".&lt;ref name="MSReimu" /&gt; It is unknown how big Makai really is, but there is known to be an end at the Pandæmonium, the fortress of Shinki.

*In the [[Windows]] canon, Makai has a barrier that makes it difficult to immigrate across; the [[Palanquin Ship]], [[Byakuren Hijiri]] and [[Nue Houjuu]] are the only known thus far to pass it. It is an unstable land with a harsh and unearthly nature that makes it difficult to survive in,&lt;ref name="UFOSanaeB" /&gt; but [[youkai]] and some [[human]]s live and/or train their powers here regardless.&lt;ref name="UFOSanaeB"&gt;[[Undefined Fantastic Object]]: [[Undefined Fantastic Object/Story/Sanae B's Scenario|Sanae B's Scenario]]&lt;/ref&gt; It is filled with a toxic [[wikipedia:Miasma theory|miasma]] that's physically harmful that makes it impossible to get to Makai, but it strengthens magical spells and seals, and it can also make learning magic easier for a human.&lt;ref name="UFOMarisaA"&gt;[[Undefined Fantastic Object]]: [[Undefined Fantastic Object/Story/Marisa A's Scenario|Marisa A's Scenario]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UFOMarisaB"&gt;[[Undefined Fantastic Object]]: [[Undefined Fantastic Object/Story/Marisa B's Scenario|Marisa B's Scenario]]&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from Byakuren formerly, no known [[character]] from the Windows era lives here. There is no history about this place, and it is unknown where it's located.

:Much of Makai's terrain is a deep red color. Various items also exists that cannot be found in [[Gensokyo]], such as a magic stone, "Makai mushrooms", and a stand that sells "Makai crackers".&lt;ref name="UFOMarisaAEnding"&gt;[[Undefined Fantastic Object]]: Marisa A's Ending&lt;/ref&gt; Many materials in Makai contain their own will, an example being the materials Byakuren used to make her sutra scroll, which the scroll and other materials is considered "cursed" by the people of [[Gensokyo]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]]: [[Symposium of Post-mysticism/Byakuren Hijiri|Byakuren Hijiri]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sakuya Izayoi]] suggests that Makai is scarier than [[Hell]],&lt;ref name="PCBSakuyaEX"&gt;[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]: [[Perfect Cherry Blossom/Story/Sakuya's Extra|Sakuya's Extra Scenario]]&lt;/ref&gt; and even [[Reimu Hakurei]] finds it creepy.&lt;ref name="UFOReimuAEnding"&gt;[[Undefined Fantastic Object]]: Reimu A's Ending&lt;/ref&gt; It was mentioned that there's a sub-location called Hokkai that is, as [[Minamitsu Murasa]] puts it, in "a corner of the infinite area of Makai".&lt;ref name="UFOMArisaB"&gt;[[Undefined Fantastic Object]]: [[Undefined Fantastic Object/Story/Reimu B's Scenario|Reimu B's Scenario]]&lt;/ref&gt; No [[demon]]s were actually presented in the modern era, but they were stated to live here.&lt;ref name="UFOSanaeB" /&gt; There are also dark-coloured [[Fairy|fairies]] and [[Sunflower Fairy|sunflower fairies]] that lurk around in Makai that blend in to the dark scene, as well as [[flying yin-yangs]].

:[[Marisa Kirisame]] has been given special permission to use Byakuren's Palanquin Ship to travel to and from Makai whenever she wants, but this has yet to happen.&lt;ref name="UFOMarisaAEnding" /&gt;

===Geography===
These are a some of the known settlements within Makai:
*The {{nihongo|'''Ruins of Vina'''&lt;ref name="HRtPEnding"&gt;[[Highly Responsive to Prayers]]: Endings&lt;/ref&gt;|ヴィナの廃墟|Vina no Haikyo}} is only seen in Makai route stages 11-15 of ''[[Highly Responsive to Prayers]]''. [[Reimu Hakurei]] encounters [[Elis]] here on the fifteenth stage. Nothing else is known about this place other than its name.
*The {{nihongo|'''Fallen Temple'''&lt;ref name="HRtPEnding" /&gt;|堕ちたる神殿|Ochitaru Shinden}} appears somewhere in Makai and it is the setting of stages 16-20 of ''[[Highly Responsive to Prayers]]'' where [[Sariel]] is. Nothing is known about it, but there appears to be a [[Wikipedia:Crucifix|crucifix]] in the background.
*{{nihongo|'''Makai City'''|魔界の街|Makai no Machi}} is what appears to be a settlement for [[demon]]s. It is the location of Stage 3 ''[[Mystic Square]]''. There appears to be a diagonal brick path, which contain two signs that read "Romantic", then "Children!" Buildings that give the appearance of a city also appear on the Final Stage when fighting Shinki, and in ''[[Undefined Fantastic Object]]'' before encountering [[Byakuren Hijiri]], as shown in the box on the right.
*{{nihongo|'''World of Ice and Snow'''&lt;ref name="MSManual" /&gt;|氷雪世界|Hyousetu Sekai}} appears on Stage 4 of ''Mystic Square'' where the heroine encounters [[Yuki]] and [[Mai]] who tried to prevent then from proceeding. It is a blue, frozen field that appears to have a river flowing through it, shown in a dark blue. Beyond here, there is Pandæmonium.
*{{nihongo|'''Pandæmonium'''&lt;ref name="MSManual" /&gt;|パンデモニウム|Pandemoniumu|also '''Pandaemonium''' or '''Pandemonium'''}} is the fortress of [[Shinki]], the creator of Makai. It seems to be constructed from a sort of crystalline material. The player visits the fortress on Stage 5 and the Final Stage of the game. Although it's not confirmed that the Final Stage ''is'' Pandæmonium, Shinki states that "there is no 'next'" when confronting [[Marisa Kirisame]], since she thought there'd be another area to go to if she defeated Shinki. Also, there appears to be the shape of the [[Wikipedia:Rubin vase|Rubin vase]] in the background of Stage 5.
*The {{H:title|'''Wonderland'''|This name is unofficial}}, implied to exist within Makai, is a part of Makai that's presumably created by [[Alice Margatroid]]. It's the setting of the Extra Stage of ''Mystic Square''.
*{{nihongo|'''Hokkai'''|法界||lit. "Realm of Truth"}} is, as [[Minamitsu Murasa]] describes it, tucked away in "a corner of Makai" in ''[[Undefined Fantastic Object]]''. Not much is actually known about it, but the heroine travels there in Stage 6 of ''[[Undefined Fantastic Object]]'' where the entire region appeared to have been tucked away with a strong seal, along with the monk [[Byakuren Hijiri]]. The Flying Storehouse was used to break the seal, and it is not filled with miasma. On the floor above Hokkai on Stage 5, there seems to be bubbles coming out that would usually appear in lava. The name is also a Buddhist term that can translate to "dharmadhātu", which is suppose to be a realm of [[Wikipedia:Dharma|Dharma]]. It was described as the "The Red and Black Seal of Makai" on Stage 5.

==Makai's Appearances==
[[File:Th01Gate.png|thumb|250px|The Gate to Makai in ''[[HRtP]]'']]
===PC-98 Games===
;''Highly Responsive to Prayers''
Makai first appeared ''[[Highly Responsive to Prayers]]'' and it is one of the main locations of the game. [[Reimu Hakurei]] discovered a portal that had opened in her shrine. A being from either here or [[Hell]] came and destroyed the [[Hakurei Shrine]], so Reimu has to go out and put a stop to their reckless nature. After beating the [[boss]] [[SinGyoku]] on [[Stage]] 5, the player will then decide which route to take: Makai or Hell. If they chose Makai, then the rest of the game will occur through here. Stages 6-10 seem to take place at the {{nihongo|'''Gate'''&lt;ref name="HRtPEnding" /&gt;|ゲート|Geeto}} to Makai, where the boss of Stage 10 is [[YuugenMagan]]. Once that enemy is defeated, Reimu shall now go through the Ruins of Vina on Stages 11-15. The Stage 15 boss is [[Elis]], who can turn into a [[bat]] and will try and put a stop to Reimu. Once she is defeated, Reimu will spend the final 5 stages at the Fallen Temple, where she'll meet [[Sariel]], the Final Boss, who must be defeated in order to clear the game.

;''Story of Eastern Wonderland''
On Stage 3 when [[Reimu Hakurei]] and [[Genji]] are travelling through the [[World of Fantasies]] in ''[[Story of Eastern Wonderland]]'', Genji references that they're on the border between [[Gensokyo]] and Makai.&lt;ref name="SoEWScenario" /&gt; Stages 4 and 5 take place at [[Reimaden]], but because of Genji's statement, it is unknown if the last two stages, or Reimaden itself, is part of Makai.

;''Mystic Square''
[[File:Th05Pandæmonium.png|thumb|200px|A part of Pandæmonium, as seen in ''[[Mystic Square]]'''s Stage 5]]
Makai was entirely the centre of the main events of ''[[Mystic Square]]'', because [[demon]]s from this world were coming to [[Gensokyo]] in great numbers as tourists due to a tourist agency that organises their travels,&lt;ref name="MSReimu" /&gt; which made [[Reimu Hakurei]], [[Marisa Kirisame]], [[Mima]] or [[Yuuka Kazami]] take a visit to Makai. Essentially, only Reimu goes to Makai for this very reason, whilst the other three will go for somewhat unrelated reasons, and thus do not resolve the actual incident. Although in Marisa's ending, she exterminates the demons. The heroine starts on Stage 1 that takes place at the "Cave in Which the Door to Makai is Said to Be", where they'll go through here fighting [[stage enemies]], specifically the [[bakebake]] and demons. The [[Wheel Demon]] is the midboss, whilst [[Sara]], the gatekeeper here, is the [[boss]]. The heroine will defeat them here and head towards Stage 2. Here, they'll fly through the border between the two worlds and fight unusual enemies. This midboss here is the [[Spirit Mirror]], and the boss is [[Louise]]. Again they're both defeated, with the latter because she was heading for Gensokyo.

Stage 3 is finally within Makai itself. The heroine will fly over Makai City fighting more demons and bakebake. Unusually, [[Hikariko]], the nameless [[fairy]]-like creature who originally appeared as the Stage 4 midboss of ''[[Lotus Land Story]]'' in [[Mugenkan]], re-appears as the midboss here. It is not explained why she's in Makai, but she is still defeated regardless of the player (that includes Yuuka). At the end of the stage, [[Alice Margatroid]] will appear for the first time in the series, who tries to prevent the heroine from going deeper into Makai. When the battle starts, the background will change into a scenery with a forest, a river and some mountains, which are all apparently made of crystal. Alice was eventually defeated.

[[File:Th05WorldOfIce&amp;Snow1.png|thumb|left|150px|World of Ice and Snow on Stage 4]]The heroine will then progress onto Stage 4 at the World of Ice and Snow. On this long stage, red and blue [[windmill]]s, as well as some other spirits and fairy-like demons will attack the player. It should be noted that blue-coloured windmills might be difficult to spot due to using the same colours as the background of the stage. A being that appears to be Louise will appear as the midboss of the stage, having a stronger attack. After more roaming, they'll encounter [[Yuki]] and [[Mai]], who too tries to prevent the heroine from going any further. They're the boss of the stage, who'll attack as a duo. Sometime after their third phrase of [[danmaku]], depending on who the player was shooting at, one of them will be defeated, and thus the other one will jump in and fight solo for the rest of the boss fight. Mai is considered easier to deal with than Yuki. Once one of these two are defeated, the heroine will move onto Stage 5.

On Stage 5, the heroine will now fly over Pandæmonium, where demons are exclusively the only stage enemy here, and that they use the same sprite as the Wheel Demon. The midboss of this stage is [[Ayana]], who is defeated, and thus the heroine will continue to roam and defeat more demons. Although, the stage can actually be skipped if you were to not defeat Ayana, where she'll be defeated by default before [[Shinki]] makes her cameo appearance on this stage. As Shinki was talking to the heroine, [[Yumeko]] will then jump in and interrupt their conversation and insists to fight the heroine, being the Stage 5 Boss. After she is defeated, the heroine will travel deeper into Pandæmonium and encounter Shinki, the Final Boss once more, where they'll discover that Shinki is the creator and ruler of Makai, and was also the one who let demons go to Gensoyko as tourist. The heroine will battle Shinki though a stages of phases in her [[danmaku]] that will change the background. One notable background is that there appears to be buildings on fire. Eventually, Shinki is defeated, and has stopped tourism to Gensokyo, although that doesn't seem to be the case in Reimu's ending.

For little reason, the heroine will return here to the Wonderland on the Extra Stage, where they'll fight stronger windmills and [[card soldier]]s, where the card soldiers will be standing on a platform, shooting danmaku only downwards. The [[Trump King]] is the midboss, but was defeated. After some more roaming fighting enemies, they will encounter Alice, who is the Extra Stage Boss. She fights using nine phases, and after a hard battle, she is finally defeated.

[[File:Th12Makai(AboveHokkai)1.jpg|thumb|200px|Makai (Above Hokkai) on Stage 5 of ''[[Undefined Fantastic Object]]'']]
;''Undefined Fantastic Object''
Makai makes a returning appearance on Stage 5 of ''[[Undefined Fantastic Object]]''. After collecting Flying Storehouse parts disguised as [[Seed of Unknown Form]]s, the heroine ended up being part of the [[youkai]] group who are trying to free [[Byakuren Hijiri]], thus travelling to Makai via the [[Palanquin Ship]] captained by [[Minamitsu Murasa]]. Once the ship lands in Makai, it runs out of fuel. The heroine then has to roam above Hokkai, fighting Makai-type [[Fairy|fairies]] and [[Sunflower Fairy|sunflower fairies]], as well as dodging the obstacles created by the [[flying yin-yangs]]. [[Nazrin]] will re-appear as the midboss of the stage, surprised that they managed to make it to Makai. She tests the [[Jeweled Pagoda of Bishamonten]] on the heroine before giving it to her master, to which she was defeated and flees once again. Off-screen, she meets with her master and gives her the pagoda. Once the heroine has done more roaming, they'll encounter [[Shou Toramaru]], Nazrin's master. The heroines want to fight her simply because she's a [[youkai]], to which she was defeated. After, the heroine will then break the seal to Hokkai with the [[Seed of Unknown Form]]s that they've been collection out of pure curiosity.

After the seal is broken, they'll enter Hokkai, the Final Stage. They'll face more fairies, where they seem to give an obvious reference to ''[[Wikipedia:Space Invaders|Space Invaders]]'' as they slowly fly down the screen. Then, Byakuren will appear, finally free thanks to the heroine. However, they discover that she is friend to all youkai, even though she wants equality with both youkai and [[human]]s, and thus they both go into battle, with Byakuren being the Final Boss. Once the heroine wins, it is implied that everyone leaves Makai thanks to Byakuren. In all the Bad endings, if the player got a continue whilst playing the game, the heroine will be trapped in Makai, trying to escape being their top priority.

===Spin-offs===
;''Double Spoiler''
Makai appears in ''[[Double Spoiler]]'' on [[stage]]s 7 and 12, with the latter stage specifically in Hokkai. On Stage 7, [[Aya Shameimaru]] and [[Hatate Himekaidou]] encounters [[Shou Toramaru]] and [[Nazrin]] to try and take photos of their [[danmaku]]. There are 7 scenes total on this stage. The previous stage is at the [[Former Capital]] in [[Former Hell]] of the [[Underworld]], whilst the next stage is at the [[Remains of the Blazing Hell]] back in the Underworld. On Stage 12, Aya and Hatate encounters [[Byakuren Hijiri]] and [[Nue Houjuu]] to try and take photos of their danmaku. There are 8 scenes total on this stage. The previous stage is at the [[Wind God's Lake]] on the [[Youkai Mountain]], whilst the next stage is at the [[Road of Lingering Snow]] on the Extra Stage. It is not explained why all these characters came back to Makai, and how Aya and Hatate managed to pass Makai's strong barrier.

==Additional Information==
===Inconsistencies===
There is a major inconsistency on what is the "true" entrance to Makai, or if there are multiple ways to enter it, even across the [[PC-98]] era. Firstly, there is a portal that leads to the gate to the Ruins of Vina in ''[[Highly Responsive to Prayers]]''. Secondly on Stage 1 of ''[[Mystic Square]]'', there is the "Cave in Which the Door to Makai is Said to Be" that leads to the border between Makai and [[Gensokyo]]&lt;ref name="MSManual" /&gt;. Thirdly on Stage 3 of ''[[Story of Eastern Wonderland]]'', the [[World of Fantasies]] is said by [[Genji]] to be the border between the two worlds.&lt;ref name="SoEWScenario" /&gt; Lastly in Reimu's Ending of ''Mystic Square'', a portal appears in front of the [[Hakurei Shrine]] that seems to come from Makai. It is unknown if any of these connect to each other. Additionally, the [[Palanquin Ship]] was used to pass over into Makai in ''[[Undefined Fantastic Object]]'' in an unknown way.

It is unknown if [[Alice Margatroid]] was a resident of Makai or not during the [[PC-98]] era. Due to Alice living in the [[Forest of Magic]] in the [[Windows]] era and being stated to be a [[magician]] who was formerly [[human]] however, there could be a potential inconsistency. [[Shinki]] is known to have created ''everything'', but it's unclear if this includes Alice. However, she does refer to [[Reimu Hakurei]] as a "human", implying that she isn't. (Youkai in PC-98 have also referred to Reimu and Marisa as "human" as well) It's unclear whether Alice was created by Shinki, was a normal magician who moved to Makai, or if her origins have been retconned by the Windows games. Due to new information in latter works and how Alice is "the same character" from PC-98, it could be said that she was in Makai to do magic training. 

Additionally, even though [[Shinki]] created ''everything'' in Makai, it is not entirely stated that this is also true for the Ruins of Vina, Fallen Temple, [[YuugenMagan]], [[Elis]] and/or [[Sariel]] in ''Highly Responsive to Prayers'' and, as already indicated, the Windows era.

===PC-98 References===
Makai made its first post-[[PC-98]] appearance in ''[[Undefined Fantastic Object]]'', but none of its known residents were seen during the game. However, various "PC-98" references was shown in within the [[Windows]] canon, such as [[fairy|fairies]] having their wings coloured similar to [[Shinki]]'s and that [[Byakuren Hijiri]] has this [[Undefined Fantastic Object/Spell Cards/Stage 6#Spell Card 90|spell card]] that's similar to one of Shinki's attacks. These dark-coloured fairies are still presented in the ''[[Touhou Project]]'' as of ''[[Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom]]''. The buildings seen over the horizon on Stage 6 of ''[[Undefined Fantastic Object]]'' seem to also reference one of Shinki's background attacks.

[[File:Th12InvaderTexture.png|thumb|150px|Texture of two lookalike Invaders in ''UFO'']]As Makai returned from the PC-98 in ''Undefined Fantastic Object'', both [[Reimu Hakurei]] and [[Marisa Kirisame]] appeared to be surprised when they heard [[Minamitsu Murasa]] said they were going to Makai, whereas [[Sanae Kochiya]] who appeared confused, wasn't. This may be another reference to the PC-98.

===Miscellaneous===
*On Stage 6 of ''Undefined Fantastic Object'' in Hokkai, fairies will fly down towards the player in a similar fashion to ''[[Wikipedia:Space Invaders|Space Invaders]]''. There is also a texture image in the background that resembles two Invaders.
*In the Phantasm stage of ''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]'', [[Sakuya Izayoi]] makes a reference to Makai stating "[[Hell]] is not as scary as Makai";&lt;ref name="PCBSakuyaEX" /&gt; this may hint that Sakuya has some relation with Makai, that she once visited here or she just happens to know about Makai.
*The girl you see on [https://onsen.touhouwiki.net/images/1/18/Th01FallenTemple.png Fallen Temple] on the Makai Route (Stages 16-19) of [[Highly Responsive to Prayers]] is a [https://onsen.touhouwiki.net/images/a/a8/TotG-Ghost.png sprite] of an enemy ghost from the game "[[w:Tournament of the Gods|Tournament of the Gods II]]".

{{nihongo|'''Mayohiga'''|マヨヒガ or 迷ひ家||lit. Lost House}} is a lost village somewhere around the [[Great Hakurei Barrier]]. It is abandoned by [[human]]s, but is home to many [[cat]]s that [[Chen]] has brought there.

==General Information==
"In an abandoned estate in the mountain recesses, in which a lost traveler, upon taking and returning with some daily necessities, received good luck," so to speak appeared as such in the ''[[Touhou Project]]''. Like the [[Hakurei Shrine]], it is located deep within the mountains near the [[Great Hakurei Barrier]]. It is unclear whether "mountain" refers to the [[Youkai Mountain]] or to some other. However, while the shrine is physically on both sides of the barrier, Mayohiga acts as the rest of the barrier separating [[Gensokyo]] from the [[Outside World]]. Humans who come near the barrier will start to become disoriented and lost, and if they continue onwards, they will find themselves spirited away to the almost dreamlike village of Mayohiga.

{{nihongo|The Village of Cats|猫の棲む里|Neko no Sumu Sato}} is believed to be located in Mayohiga, far away from the [[Human Village]], where it is a place that [[Chen]] can try to make the [[cat]]s here her servants. Chen brought the cats here because [[human]]s abandoned this village ages ago. 

It is a very likely that the explanation of [[Yukari Yakumo]] and [[Ran Yakumo]] living in Mayohiga is actually not true. Yukari's residence has been described as "A place of unknown location that no-one should ever be able to reach," but Mayohiga is occasionally stumbled upon by lost humans, from which it is also possible to return safely. Moreover, the presence of information on Mayohiga in the [[Gensokyo Chronicle]] show some awareness of its existence on the humans' part.

==Background Information==
===Name===
The spellings マヨヒガ, 迷ひ家, and ''Mayohiga'' are all archaisms based on the pre-WWII orthography and do not reflect the pronunciation of the name. Modernly, it is spelled マヨイガ in katakana, 迷い家 in kanamajiri, and ''Mayoiga'' in Romaji. In ''Perfect Cherry Blossom'', the old katakana spelling is used in the stage title while the modern kanamajiri spelling is used in the dialogue.

===Fokloric Basis===
The original source of Mayohiga appears to be from 1910 book {{nihongo||遠野物語|Tōno Monogatari|Tōno Legend}}, a collection of folk stories by [[Wikipedia:Kunio Yanagita|Kunio Yanagita]], known to be the founding father of [[Wikipedia:Japanese folklore|Japanese folklore]]. The tale, told mainly in the northeast of Japan, is about a strange house reached by people wandering into another world. 

Although there are unusually many variations of the story, the basic plot remains the same: a traveler lost among the mountain recesses stumbles upon a mansion with a beautiful door, and upon entering and leaving with some tableware and daily necessities, experiences good fortune. Some describe a lot of livestock living at the mansion and several kinds of flowers blooming out of season in its gardens, while other versions describe the place as completely deserted, with no sign of any living thing. Some versions definitely state that the traveler will be able to return, while others say that not all travelers will be able to do so. In some versions, the good luck brought by the items taken home is trivial, while in other versions the items bring the traveler's family great prosperity for many generations.

It was the version in ''Tōno Monogatari'' that became best-known internationally. In chapters 63-64 of the book, the appearance and circumstance of the Mayohiga is described thus:
*"At the house were many cows, horses, and chickens, and flowers of red and white were in bloom."
*"Likewise, entering through the foyer brought the visitor to a serving-room. In the parlor, a kettle of water was on to boil, as if someone were just about to make tea and had left for the lavatory."

In ''Tōno Monogatari'', Mayohiga exists on Mount Shiromi in Tōno, and in manuscripts of the book, was even indicated on a map. The fact that [[Wikipedia:Tōno, Iwate|Tōno]] was once a source of great wealth, seemingly from another world, perhaps contributed to the formation of this legend.

==Mayohiga's Appearance==
;''Perfect Cherry Blossom''
Mayohiga is the location of [[Stage]] 2 in ''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]'', and the stage theme is "The Fantastic Tales from Tono". The heroines travel here to look for the source as to who took spring from [[Gensokyo]], only to find the place deserted, except for some [[Fairy|fairies]]. [[Chen]] appears as the mid-boss of the stage and then again as the [[boss]]. She announces that whoever wanders into Mayohiga can never return, but she is easily defeated, and the heroine is able to leave without any trouble.

The {{nihongo|'''Misty Lake'''|霧の湖|Kiri no Mizuumi}} is a large lake located at the foot of the [[Youkai Mountain]]. Many [[fairy|fairies]] and [[youkai]] alike appear to gather here, especially during the summertime, given the abundant water. The lake and its environs appear to be the home of [[Cirno]], [[Daiyousei]] and [[Wakasagihime]].

==General Information==
Commonly, when someone says {{nihongo|"The lake"|湖|mizuumi}}, it usually refers to the Misty Lake. The water in the lake comes from a river originating from the [[Youkai Mountain]]. Near by the lake is the [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]], which is built on a ridge next to the lake itself, rather than on an island. At and around noon each day, a strange mist envelops the entire lake, making it difficult to see anything (hence the origin of the name). The origin of this mist is unknown, but it appears that because of the bad visibility, the lake isn't as big as one would think – it would take about an hour to walk the full length around the river&lt;ref&gt;[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]] - [[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Misty Lake|Misty Lake]]&lt;/ref&gt;, so one can estimate the circumference to be about 3.1 miles (5 km).

Extremely large monster fish live in the lake as well, and can occasionally be caught on nights of the new moon. This has led to the lake being popular amongst anglers who aim to catch such a fish. These fish range from 2 to 5 fathoms (in essence up to 9 meters), with the largest on recording as 10 fathoms (this is believed to be an exaggeration).

A '''Master of the Lake''' also lives there. However, his house is so deep down that only fish or amphibians may dive down there.&lt;ref&gt;[[Silent Sinner in Blue]] Chapter 16. "The master of the lake's house?" "No, only fish folk or mermaids could dive down that far," as said in the chapter is a mistranslation. Where "fish folk" and "mermaid" is used for {{lang|ja|魚類}} and {{lang|ja|兩生類}}, these words simply mean fish or amphibian.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Lake's appearances==
===Games===
;''Embodiment of Scarlet Devil''
The lake first appeared on [[stage]] 2 of ''[[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]]'' while the heroine was looking for the [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]]. The midboss and [[boss]] of the stage is [[Daiyousei]] and [[Cirno]] respectively.

;''Phantasmagoria of Flower View''
The lake appeared as a stage location in ''[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]'', in which it's the home location for [[Cirno]]. The stage generally appears on stage 1 or 2 in all scenarios of the game. During this event, there was no mist. Various characters will come here to look for leads towards the flower incident, only to find and defeat Cirno. In [[Eiki Shiki, Yamaxanadu]]'s scenario, she'll come here to see if Cirno has been keeping up with what she (supposed to have) learnt by the [[yama]], to which she hasn't.

;''Double Dealing Character''
The lake once again appeared on the first [[stage]] of ''[[Double Dealing Character]]'', where the heroine once again encounters Cirno and meets [[Wakasagihime]].

===Spin-offs===
;''Shoot the Bullet''
The lake appears in ''[[Shoot the Bullet]]'' on [[stage]] 2, where [[Aya Shameimaru]] encounters [[Cirno]] and [[Letty Whiterock]] to try and take photos of their [[danmaku]]. The previous stage is at the [[Youkai Trail]], whilst the next stage is at the [[Giant Toad's Pond]] on the [[Youkai Mountain]]. There are 6 scenes total on the stage.

;''Touhou Hisoutensoku''
It later made its appearance in ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]'' as a stage location, where [[Sanae Kochiya]] and Cirno both fight it first out at the edge of the lake as they look for their targets.

;''Fairy Wars''
The lake also appears in ''[[Fairy Wars]]'' on one side of it, where its stage number can be random and having the [[boss]] at the end of the stage is different.

;''Impossible Spell Card''
In the latest spin-off, the lake appears on the first day of ''[[Impossible Spell Card]]'', the starting point where [[Seija Kijin]] became a rebel who must defend herself from other [[youkai]] who are trying to capture her. It is here that she learnt that she'll be facing [[spell card]]s that are considered impossible to dodge. Scene 1 of the day is a tutorial to the mechanics of the game, where Seija will face [[Yatsuhashi Tsukumo]] and must dodge a wall of [[danmaku]] using the cheating item "[[Nimble Fabric]]". On the rest of the scenes, she'll fight against both Cirno and [[Wakasagihime]] as they try to capture her with their "impossible" [[spell card]]s. There are 6 scenes total in the day. The next day is located at the path towards the [[Myouren Temple]].

===Literature===
In ''[[Strange and Bright Nature Deity]]'' Cirno tried to freeze the whole lake, but while she was away the [[Three Fairies of Light]] destroyed her home, which led to the events of ''[[Fairy Wars]]''.

The {{nihongo|'''[[wikipedia:Moon|Moon]]'''|{{ruby-ja|月|つき}}|tsuki}} is a [[wikipedia:Natural satellite|natural satellite]] that orbits our Earth in outer space. It is in the [[Outside World]] and not located in [[Gensokyo]], but residents of Gensokyo can still see it in the sky every night. Despite it being a lifeless rock, there exists a world similar to that of Gensokyo.

==General Information==
[[File:SSiBCh12Cover.jpg|thumb|180px|left|The surface of the Moon in ''[[Silent Sinner in Blue]]'']]
In reality, the Moon is rocky and dusty, and about ¼ the size of the Earth. The gravity is about ⅙ of Earths, and it takes about 29·53 days for the Moon to both rotate on its axis and to orbit Earth. It's visible because sunlight reflects on its surface, and depending on the location of the sun and moon, we'll either see a full moon, half moon or no moon (new moon). There's also a faint atmosphere on the Moon, although giving no support of life, and there's known to be water. In relation to the ''[[Touhou Project]]'', some of these statistics aren't presented. As shown in ''[[Silent Sinner in Blue]]'', there's an atmosphere and has living beings on it, called [[Lunarians]]. The gravity seems to be the same as Earth and it has an actual sea with forests and a city, called the [[Lunar Capital]]. However, these Earth-like environments are inaccessible to humans of the [[Outside World]].

The Moon doesn't undergo changes in season like the Earth does. At the far side of the Moon, the climate is somewhere in between the four seasons of the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cage in Lunatic Runagate/Third Chapter|Cage in Lunatic Runagate Third Chapter]]. "There is no trace of the seasons which bring occasional discomfort to the living; it's a climate that combines the mildness of spring, the liveliness of summer, the plenty of autumn and the loneliness of winter year-round."&lt;/ref&gt;

The path between the Moon and the Earth only exists in Gensokyo during a full moon, which is why Eirin and Kaguya conspired to hide it during the events of [[Imperishable Night]]. This is possibly because the full moon resembles a mirror, and reflections are a key aspect of traveling to the far side of the Moon.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cage in Lunatic Runagate/Fifth_Chapter|Cage in Lunatic Runagate: Fifth Chapter]]. "The crescent moon a sword, the half moon a bow. What can the full moon be called? A mirror. A large mirror that reflects the sunlight, and at the same time illuminates the darkness of the Earth. The most light comes from the full moon.&lt;/ref&gt; It's difficult to get to the Moon from the Earth, but there are many possible ways to do it&lt;ref&gt;[[Cage in Lunatic Runagate/First_Chapter|Cage in Lunatic Runagate First Chapter]]. "There are many ways to travel between Earth and the moon, but as the lunar veil is the most primitive, it's fairly time-consuming. It's a method that's primarily used by the moon rabbits."&lt;/ref&gt;, such as manipulation of reflections and boundaries, rocket ships, use of a [[Lunar Veil]] or accessing the [[Dream World]]. Those who have become awakened to how the Earth consists of infinite possibilities may connect the Moon and the Earth, as well.

Staring at the true full moon is said to be able to induce insanity in humans, though if the series protagonists are any indication this is possible to resist. Also, it's known to make [[youkai]] stronger, or even change their form when it's a full moon, such as [[Keine Kamishirasawa]] turning into a [[Therianthrope|Were]]-[[hakutaku]], or [[Kagerou Imaizumi]] turning into a werewolf. The Moon is also an important heavenly body for youkai, holding festivals on days when the Moon is a full moon.&lt;ref name="CoLA22"&gt;[[Curiosities of Lotus Asia/Chapter 22|Curiosities of Lotus Asia: Chapter 22]]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, [[Luna Child]] has strong connections with the moon. In the [[PC-98]] [[canon]], it's said that [[Mima]]'s power is at its strongest when the moon is out.

===Geography and People===
[[File:PMiSS lunarcapital.jpg|thumb|left|140px|The [[Lunar Capital]], as illustrated in ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'']]
The Moon is the home to the [[lunarian]]s and [[moon rabbit]]s (including [[Eirin Yagokoro]], [[Kaguya Houraisan]], and [[Reisen Udongein Inaba]]), whose civilization is hidden from humans in a similar manner to [[Gensokyo]]. The moon has two main faces: the [[Wikipedia:Near side of the Moon|Near side of the Moon]] and the {{nihongo|[[Wikipedia:Far Side of the Moon|Far Side of the Moon]]|月の裏}}. The near side is the Moon that most of the [[Outside World]] and [[Gensokyo]] is familiar with.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cage in Lunatic Runagate/Third Chapter|Cage in Lunatic Runagate: Third Chapter]]. A barren mountain devoid of grass or trees, the remnants of machines from the humans' lunar expeditions, a black sky. And, a world without any air. The desolate near side of the moon. This is the lunar world that the humans discovered. It is an exceedingly cruel, lonely world.&lt;/ref&gt; It's inaccessible to ordinary [[lunarian]]s&lt;ref&gt;[[Silent Sinner in Blue]] Chapter 1. "The people from the Lunar Capital shouldn't have been able to touch the surface of the Moon."&lt;/ref&gt;, likely similar to how the Outside World is inaccessible to ordinary inhabitants of Gensokyo. The far side is known as the "true" Moon and it's the location of its only known metropolis; the [[Lunar Capital]], closed away by a barrier.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cage in Lunatic Runagate/Third Chapter|Cage in Lunatic Runagate: Third Chapter]]. The Lunar Capital is on the far side of the moon, protected by a barrier that hides its existence. As long as that barrier is in place, a human could never reach it.&lt;/ref&gt; It can't typically be seen directly under normal circumstances (but the heroine of ''[[Imperishable Night]]'' had the opportunity to look at it when Eirin unveiled it), but can be seen in reflections.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red/Suika|Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red: Suika Ibuki's Interview]]. "You can almost never see the real Moon, and its appearance is death to humans. You can only see the Moon when it's reflected in things."&lt;/ref&gt; Ordinary humans can't even look directly at it without going mad, although looking at it in reflections seems to give no ill effects.

In [[Shinto]] myth, it was instead many [[god]]s under Amaterasu who fought to unify Japan. However, given that the lord of the [[Lunar Capital]] is [[Lord Tsukuyomi]], who in Shinto myth was one of the main gods along with his sister Amaterasu, many of these gods and many Lunarians may be one and the same, but this isn't confirmed. It's highly likely, however, as in an interview in ''[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]]'', [[ZUN]] has stated that the Moon is where the noble types of gods live, and referred to Eirin as a god.

The true names of some Lunarians, including [[Eirin Yagokoro]] and [[Chang'e]], are unknown and unpronounceable to the people of Earth, so they use different given names on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;[[Silent Sinner in Blue]] Chapter 2. '''Reisen:''' "You know ____'s name, just who are..."
'''Eirin:''' "I had to call that name to determine whether you were really a moon rabbit or not."
'''Reisen:''' "How can an Earth person even say ____'s name correctly?"
'''Eirin:''' "You shouldn't say that name so lightly. ____ is known as Chang'e here on Earth. So please use that name from now on."
'''Eirin:''' "I am ____ Yagokoro."&lt;/ref&gt;

The moon is said to be a [[Pure Land]] similar to [[Higan]] where the impurity of life and death does not exist, and thus nothing can age or grow sick while on the moon. However, allowing either mortals or those who have drunk the [[Hourai Elixir]] to live on the moon for too long could result in it becoming [[purity|tainted]]. [[Kaguya Houraisan]]'s manipulation of eternity allowed her to recreate this environment in [[Eientei]].

Things such as insects don't appear to live on the Moon, but it has numerous peach and [[Udonge Tree|udonge]] trees.

The lunar seas exist on the "far side" as actual bodies of (lifeless) water - they're the closest point of the Moon to Earth and the usual arrival point for travelers, regardless of their means of travel.

====The Lunar Seas====
The far side of the Moon has several seas. These seas are the closest points to the Earth, and thus various beings from Earth may find their way to the far side of the Moon from there.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cage in Lunatic Runagate/Third Chapter|Cage in Lunatic Runagate: Third Chapter]]. "The moon's seas are its closest points to the Earth. As a result, living things from the Earth would occasionally find their way there."&lt;/ref&gt; It's implied that this is due to the reflections of the "True" Moon and the Earth, which can be viewed in the water. [[Watatsuki no Toyohime]] mentions the reflection of the Earth while musing how [[Mizue no Uranoshimako]] crossed into the far side of the Moon by chasing and riding a turtle into the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cage in Lunatic Runagate/Third Chapter|Cage in Lunatic Runagate: Third Chapter]]. "Over 1500 years ago, a human by the name Mizue no Uranoshimako appeared from the blue planet reflected in the ocean." The "blue planet" is Earth.&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Yukari Yakumo]] has opened a path to the Moon for both Genso-Lunar wars using its reflection on the surface of the water, and her destination point started over the sea. The way from the Moon to the Earth can be through the reflections of the Moon's seas, as well.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cage in Lunatic Runagate/Fifth Chapter|Cage in Lunatic Runagate: Fifth Chapter]]. "Correct, well done. The moon was covered with a very beautiful sea and the youkai knew instantaneously that the way back would be to go through the planet that was reflected on its surface."&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Remilia Scarlet]]'s [[Moon Rocket]] landed on the far side of the Moon during the second Genso-Lunar war, she landed near the sea of Prosperity. All of the seas have no [[impurity|impurities]], and no life.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cage in Lunatic Runagate/Fifth Chapter|Cage in Lunatic Runagate: Fifth Chapter]]. "That was because there was no life in the seas of the moon.".&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sea of Tranquility is the furthest sea from the Lunar Capital. It's on the other side of the moon from the Lunar Capital, so the citizens of the capital and the [[moon rabbit]]s seldom visited it.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cage in Lunatic Runagate/Third Chapter|Cage in Lunatic Runagate: Third Chapter]]. "The Sea of Tranquility was on the other side of the moon from the lunar capital, so the citizens of the capital and the moon rabbits seldom visited it."&lt;/ref&gt; By starting from here and following an invisible predetermined route through the various seas of the Moon, one can cross through the barrier around the Lunar Capital.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cage in Lunatic Runagate/Third Chapter|Cage in Lunatic Runagate: Third Chapter]]. "To make its way into that barrier, the crow would have to fly along a predetermined route, but somehow it was following the sea road that should have been invisible to it."&lt;/ref&gt; In order of furthest to closest, other seas of the moon are the Sea of Serenity, the Sea of Rains, and the Ocean of Storms (Oceanus Procellarum). These seas are aptly named, as depicted in ''[[Silent Sinner in Blue]]'' Chapter 16. After the Ocean of Storms, there's at least one more sea to cross before one can cross the barrier around the Lunar Capital.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cage in Lunatic Runagate/Third Chapter|Cage in Lunatic Runagate: Third Chapter]]. "I went on ahead to manipulate what was at the crow's destination to lay a trap over the final sea between it and the capital."&lt;/ref&gt;

The sages of the Moon (shown to be the Watatsuki sisters) have their living residence in a sea after the Ocean of Storms called [[wikipedia:Mare Ingenii|Mare Ingenii]] - The Sage's Sea&lt;ref&gt;[[Silent Sinner in Blue]] Chapter 16. "The entrance to the sea where the sages live should open soon." and [[Silent Sinner in Blue]] Chapter 17. "Mare Ingeni - The Sages' Sea."&lt;/ref&gt;, possibly because of the closer proximity to Earth and their duty to watch over it.

===History===
The moon's inhabitants once fought a "war" against the humans of Earth, beginning when the astronauts of the [[Wikipedia:Apollo program|Apollo program]] placed a flag on the moon (thus declaring it to be 'theirs'); however, although the Lunarians had mobilized for war and refer to the incident as the "Lunar War"&lt;ref&gt;[[Cage in Lunatic Runagate/First Chapter|Cage in Lunatic Runagate First Chapter]]. "She originally fled the Lunar War, but I hid the fact that she stumbled upon this house by accident." The terms "war" and "Lunar War" are used to refer to the incident elsewhere, as well.&lt;/ref&gt;, no known direct fighting took place, although it is said, that the Apollo crew was injured.&lt;ref&gt;[[Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom/Story/Sanae%27s_Scenario#Stage_6|Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom: Sanae's Scenario (Stage 6)]]. "After all, even the crew of Apollo 11 was covered with wounds, they say."&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the lunarians sabotaged the humans' attempts to establish a foothold on the Moon and their "invasion" was ultimately unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cage in Lunatic Runagate/First Chapter|Cage in Lunatic Runagate First Chapter]]. "But, if you know where to look, the moon's technological prowess was far beyond that of the Earth's. The humans had spoken of building a base on the moon, but in the end they ran back home before ever deciding on a place or even acquiring the means to do such a thing. It was a terrible defeat for the humans."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Cage in Lunatic Runagate/Third Chapter|Cage in Lunatic Runagate: Third Chapter]]. "For now, all that's happened is the launch of a primitive rocket to the side of the moon closest to them, but we can't afford to be careless."&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, a project named after the sun (Apollo), which was the opposite of the Moon, was doomed to never reach the Moon Capital.&lt;ref&gt;[[Silent Sinner in Blue]] Chapter 2. "Apollo was the name of the God of the Sun. The Sun and the Lunar Capital are incompatible, so the Capital was never found, and the danger passed.&lt;/ref&gt; Most humans of the [[Outside World]] are unaware of this failure, as those who are aware didn't report about it, presumably to keep spirits up and morale high.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cage in Lunatic Runagate/First Chapter|Cage in Lunatic Runagate First Chapter]]. "The humans' lunar landings were reported as a great success in the outside world, but their failures were not.&lt;/ref&gt; However, an escalation occurred a few decades later when humans attempted to build colonies on the moon via the [[Wikipedia:Chang'e program|Chang'e program]] which, being named after an actual prisoner on the moon, was much more threatening.&lt;ref&gt;[[Silent Sinner in Blue]] Chapter 2. "However, the name Chang'e belongs to a real person who is imprisoned in the Moon even now."&lt;/ref&gt; The results are unknown.

In the distant past the people of the moon tried regulating people of the Earth by creating monsters, according to Kaguya in ''[[Imperishable Night]]'', which may mean they were responsible for the creation of [[youkai]]. At the very least, according to [[Yukari Yakumo]], it was the dim light of the moon that indirectly gave birth to the youkai by causing human's fears and legends about them. Also according to Kaguya, things such as magic originated from the moon- "''The moon gave many powers to beings of the earth. Many of them, such as magic, were originally the moon's power.''"

The creation of magic and possibly youkai isn't the only way that the Lunarians have manipulated Earth and its history. Branches of the [[Udonge Tree]] were used by Lunarians to sow conflict on Earth, to keep the Earth from being stagnant. In this way, the Lunarians have manipulated the Earth's history as they saw fit.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cage in Lunatic Runagate/Second Chapter|Cage in Lunatic Runagate Second Chapter]]. "The history of Earth has progressed just the way the moon has wanted it."&lt;/ref&gt;. They have also indiscreetly used shimenawa ropes to bind those who could be a threat to them, such as Lord Daikoku, and it's implied they were the ones behind the great wars to unify Japan into one country, long ago.&lt;ref&gt;[[Silent Sinner in Blue]] Chapter 19. Yukari's conversation with Toyohime.&lt;/ref&gt;

More than a thousand years ago, Yukari Yakumo launched a failed invasion of the moon after gathering a youkai army. Her exact reasons are currently unknown.

==Background Information==
The English proper name is "the Moon". The word "moon" came from ''moone'' (which is from around 1380), which developed from "mone" (which is from 1135), which that came from [[Wikipedia:Old English|Old English]] "mōna" (dating from before 725), which came from the [[wikipedia:Proto-Germanic|Proto-Germanic]] word "mǣnōn". The modern English adjective to the word Moon is {{nihongo|''lunar''|ルーナ|Rūna}}, which came from the Latin word ''Luna''. Another less common adjective is ''selenic'', which came from the Ancient Greek word ''Selene'' ({{lang|el|Σελήνη}}), which is from the prefix "seleno-" (as in ''selenography''). In Japanese, the origin of the kanji {{lang|ja|"[[Wiktionary:月|月]]"}} (meaning 'Moon') comes from the shape of a crescent moon.

The concept of a Near Side of the Moon and Far Side of the Moon comes from how one half of the moon's hemisphere (the near side) is always facing (and viewable) from the Earth, while the other (the far side) isn't. To date, humanity hasn't set foot on the far side of the moon, although photographs of it were taken from certain Apollo ships. The Lunar seas are named and based after the lunar mares on the moon. Lunar mares are basaltic plains on Earth's Moon formed by ancient volcanic eruptions, and were commonly mistaken as actual seas by astronomers.

Having [[moon rabbit]]s living on the Moon is based on the Japanese folkfore that [[Wikipedia:Moon rabbit|rabbits live on the Moon]] because the markings on the Moon shows the appearance of a rabbit making mochi.

==Moon's Appearances==
On a frequent basis, the Moon will appear as a cameo in various ''[[Touhou Project]]'' games and manga.

===PC-98 Games===
The moon had some cameo appearances in the [[PC-98]] era, such as the background of the [[Probability Space Hypervessel]] within the cut-scene before stage 8 of ''[[Phantasmagoria of Dim.Dream]]'', [[Kana Anaberal]] and [[Mima]]'s ending of the same game, [[Reimu Hakurei]]'s ending of ''[[Lotus Land Story]]'', and Mima's ending of ''[[Mystic Square]]''. Specifically in Mima's ending of ''Phantasmagoria of Dim.Dream'', Mima wished for [[Yumemi Okazaki]] to always keep the moon in the sky. Thus, Yumemi changed the moon to [[Wikipedia:Geosynchronous orbit|geosynchronous orbit]], having Mima to always have strong power. It's presumed that the Moon goes back to normal orbit afterwards, as suggested in later games.

===Windows Games===
;''Embodiment of Scarlet Devil''
In ''[[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]]'', the Moon appeared on [[stage]] 6 before [[Remilia Scarlet]] made her début, as well as the background of her [[spell card]]s. Here, the Moon appears to be red, likely from the reflection of the scarlet mist that caused the events of the game.

;''Imperishable Night''
[[File:Th08BambooForestEx.jpg|thumb|180px|The Moon in ''IN'']]
Even though it only made a few physical cameos in ''[[Imperishable Night]]'' on stage 6B and the Extra, it had a major role to the story, because [[Eirin Yagokoro]] sealed Earth from the Moon and replaced it with a fake one because she didn't want [[Kaguya Houraisan]] to be captured by the [[Lunarian]]s, much to the [[youkai]]'s trouble. Thus, Eirin and Kaguya must be defeated to restore the true moon. A month later after the incident, the full moon was out, and it caused [[Keine Kamishirasawa]] to turn into a [[Therianthrope|Were]]-[[hakutaku]]. Also, it appeared on the background of [[Remilia Scarlet]]'s last word.

;''Mountain of Faith''
The Moon appeared in the background of stage 6 of ''[[Mountain of Faith]]'' at the [[Wind God's Lake]]. It appeared tiny above the screen, and it also appeared in the background of [[Kanako Yasaka]]'s [[spell card]]s.

;''Double Dealing Character''
The Moon had a cameo on stage 3 of ''[[Double Dealing Character]]'', where it can be seen reflected on the floor. Because it was a full moon, this caused [[Kagerou Imaizumi]] to turn into a werewolf, thus acting unusual as part of the game.

;''Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom''
The Moon is, for the first time, a major stage location in ''[[Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom]]''. [[Moon rabbit]]s were coming to [[Gensokyo]] to purify it because the [[Lunar Capital]] was under attack by [[Junko]]. To the heroine's trouble, they went to the Moon via the [[Dream World]] on Stage 3 to see why the [[Lunarian]]s were attacking Gensokyo. They arrived at the Lunar Capital on Stage 4, only to be attacked by [[flying yin-yangs]]. They encounter the [[stage]] [[boss]] [[Sagume Kishin]], who after testing their strength, told them that the capital was evacuating from Junko's threat. She then told them to go to the [[Sea of Tranquility]] to find her, the setting of Stage 5. The heroine will fly over a plain lunar mare only to be attacked by purified [[Fairy|fairies]] who migrated from [[Hell]], along with [[Clownpiece]], the stage boss. After she is defeated, she escorts the heroine to the underside of the mare, where the heroine will be attacked by some spirits, but then they'll finally encounter Junko, the Final Boss. After her defeat, the Lunarians (should've) stopped attacking Gensokyo and return to the Moon.

The Moon also makes a cameo on stage 2 at the [[Wind God's Lake]], and again on stage 3 of the Dream World.

;''Unconnected Marketeers''
The Moon appears in the background of Stage 6 in Unconnected Marketeers and becomes increasingly bigger during [[Chimata Tenkyuu]]'s fight.

===Spin-offs===
;''Shoot the Bullet''
The  Moon made a cameo on stage 7 of ''[[Shoot the Bullet]]'' when [[Aya Shameimaru]] faces [[Sakuya Izayoi]] and [[Remilia Scarlet]].

;''Double Spoiler''
The Moon made a cameo on stage 11 of ''[[Double Spoiler]]'' at the [[Wind God's Lake]].

;''Impossible Spell Card''
The Moon appears on a few occasions in ''[[Impossible Spell Card]]'', primarily the background of day 3 ([[Bamboo Forest of the Lost]]), [[Mamizou Futatsuiwa]]'s spell card background, [[Kanako Yasaka]]'s spell card background, the background of the Last Day at the [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]] and [[Remilia Scarlet]]'s spell card background.

;''Urban Legend in Limbo''
The Moon had a cameo appearance on a number of stages in ''[[Urban Legend in Limbo]]'', primarily on night versions of the [[Palanquin Ship]], the [[Youkai Tanuki Forest]], the [[Bamboo Forest of the Lost]] and the [[Shining Needle Castle]].

===Literature===
;''Curiosity of Lotus Asia''
The Moon makes a number of cameos in ''[[Curiosities of Lotus Asia]]'', as well as a few mentions. It makes a cameo on 1, 4, 17 and 24, and it was mentioned on chapters 18, 22, 24 and 26. On chapter 18, [[Rinnosuke Morichika]] compared the Moon to a colorful kappa shell and how the shell can be lucky to take [[Sakuya Izayoi]]'s mistress to the Moon, as staged below.

;''Touhou Bougetsushou''
[[File:SSiBpencilboard.jpg|thumb|150px|The Moon seen below Reimu, Marisa and Remilia]]
The Moon has a major role in the ''[[Touhou Bougetsushou]]'' series. [[Eirin Yagokoro]] talks with [[Kaguya Houraisan]] about the latest rumour from the moon that another lunar war may emerge. [[Yukari Yakumo]] asked [[Reimu Hakurei]] to train channelling gods and managed to get the inhabitants of the [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]] to create a [[Moon Rocket]] to take them to the Moon. [[Reisen]] came to the [[Hakurei Shrine]] then [[Eientei]] to be given a letter by Eirin Yagokoro for the Watatsuki sisters. Eirin also secretly places a [[Lunar Veil]] on the rocket so Reimu, [[Remilia Scarlet]], [[Marisa Kirisame]] and [[Sakuya Izayoi]] are guaranteed to arrive at the Moon safely. When they do, the rocket landed into the Sea of Prosperity and it was destroyed. They came across [[Watatsuki no Yorihime]], who threatened them as to why they came to the Moon, to which Remilia announces that she wants to conquer the Moon.

They were all defeated using the [[spell card]] rule and were sent back to Earth, minus Reimu. During the battle, Yuyuko and [[Youmu Konpaku]] entered the Moon via a reflexion on the Earth's surface, and headed towards the [[Lunar Capital]], and Yukari and [[Ran Yakumo]] tried to access the Moon via a [[gap]] from the [[Bamboo Forest of the Lost]], but ended up at the forest again, only to meet with [[Watatsuki no Toyohime]], who nearly took them to the Moon for punishment. Reimu had to stay on the moon to clear her name and demonstrate her power of channeling gods. Eventually, Reimu returned to Earth, and was invited to the Scarlet Devil Mansion for a swimming pool party with Marisa, Yuyuko and others. Because the Watatsuki sisters were occupied by the Earthlings, their home would be empty, leaving Yuyuko and Youmu to steal some sake and have it drank at the mansion. To Yukari's eyes, this occasion was a victory for the Earthlings.

===Uwabami Breakers===
The moon (presuming to be the same one judging that the setting of the game is in the [[Outside World]]) appears as a cameo on the title of ''[[Uwabami Breakers]]'' above the [[Twilight Bar Room]], colored in red.

==Additional Information==
*The ''[[Magical Astronomy]]'' CD liner notes depict tourism to the Moon being commonplace in the [[Outside World]], during the near-future time inhabited by [[Maribel Hearn]] and [[Renko Usami]]. How this affects relations between humans and Lunarians is currently unknown, but the Lunar Capital's existence doesn't appear to be public knowledge.
*Many of the tales of the mythical Dragon King's Palace are based on the Lunar Capital, due to the Watatsuki sisters lying to Mizue no Uranoshimako about his location when he found himself there.

The {{nihongo|'''Moriya Shrine'''|守矢神社|Moriya Jinja}} is a [[Shinto]] [[wikipedia:Shinto shrine|shrine]], originally from the [[Outside World]], that was transported to [[Gensokyo]] by the [[god]] [[Kanako Yasaka]] during the start of the events of ''[[Mountain of Faith]]''. It is now located somewhere near the top of [[Youkai Mountain]] beside a neighboring Divine Lake that was brought with it.

This shrine is home to the priestess [[Sanae Kochiya]] and its resident gods [[Kanako Yasaka]] and [[Suwako Moriya]]. Both the [[kappa]] and [[tengu]] have come to accept Kanako as a resident god and now live in peace. As the shrine gets few visitors, its primary source of income comes from selling bits of outside-world technology to the kappa.&lt;ref name="SoPmKanako"&gt;''[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]]'' - [[Symposium of Post-mysticism/Kanako Yasaka|Kanako Yasaka]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background Information==
[[File:Suwa Taisha Shimosha Akimiya Kaguraden.jpg|200px|thumb|left|The autumn shrine building of the real-life [[Wikipedia:Suwa taisha|Suwa Grand Shrine]], on which Moriya Shrine is based.]]
As noted in ''[[Silent Sinner in Blue]]'', a distinctively thick [[wikipedia:Shimenawa|shimenawa]] is hung across the entrance of the shrine building, bigger than the one at the [[Hakurei Shrine]]. As an aside, we can see the same design at [[Wikipedia:Suwa taisha|Suwa Grand Shrine]], the original inspiration of Moriya Shrine. The [[Outside World]] Moriya Shrine (with a different kanji, '''{{nihongo|洩}}'''{{nihongo|矢神社}}) also exists near the Suwa Grand Shrine.

In chapter 19 of ''[[Silent Sinner in Blue]]'', [[Yukari Yakumo]] accuses [[Watatsuki no Toyohime]] that the [[Lunarian]]s placed the two thick shimenawa at the front of the Moriya Shrine to seal in the war god, Take-Minakata, because they feared his retribution after conquering his father Daikoku's lands. According to Shinto legend, [[wikipedia:Amaterasu|Amaterasu]] (generally implied in the ''[[Touhou Project]]'' to be sister of [[Lord Tsukuyomi]], founder of the [[Lunar Capital]]) sent Take-Mikazuchi to conquer Take-Minakata while trying to unite [[wikipedia:Japan|Japan]]. After a sumo match, Take-minakata's arms were cut and he fled to Lake Suwa, where he married a Suwa goddess, Yasakatome. The conversation is interrupted before Yukari's claim can be confirmed. However, the fact that Toyohime decided to leave Yukari behind on Earth as opposed to taking Yukari prisoner to the [[Moon]] like she initially planned to do could imply there is some truth to Yukari's claim.

Moriya Shrine has a tiny branch shrine on the grounds of the [[Hakurei Shrine]]&lt;ref&gt;''[[Mountain of Faith]]'' Reimu-C Good Ending&lt;/ref&gt;, and a number of roadside shrines around the outskirts of the [[Human Village]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Forbidden Scrollery]]'' chapter 23&lt;/ref&gt;

After years of negotiation with the [[tengu]],&lt;ref&gt;''[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]]'' - [[Symposium of Post-mysticism/Bunbunmaru Newspaper 6|Bunbunmaru Newspaper: Opinions Divided On Mountain's Future Direction]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'' chapter 19&lt;/ref&gt; an [[wikipedia:aerial tramway|aerial tramway]] was opened in the spring of 2017,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'' chapter 39&lt;/ref&gt; directly connecting the shrine to the foot of the mountain and making it accessible to even normal humans.

==Moriya Shrine's Appearances==
===Games===
;''[[Mountain of Faith]]''
When [[Sanae Kochiya|a mysterious shrine maiden]] attempts to convince Reimu to shut down the [[Hakurei Shrine]], Reimu and Marisa climb [[Youkai Mountain]] to investigate. Along the way they learn that [[Kanako Yasaka|a new god]] has recently arrived from the Outside World with an entire shrine and lake in tow, and her ambition has brought her into conflict with the native [[kappa]] and [[tengu]]. The shrine itself is the setting for [[stage]]s 5, 6 and Extra.

;''[[Subterranean Animism]]''
In the Extra stage of ''[[Subterranean Animism]]'', Reimu and Marisa travel to Moriya Shrine after learning that [[Utsuho Reiuji]] received her nuclear powers from "two gods who came down from a mountain". Kanako and Suwako are not present at the time, but they do encounter [[Sanae Kochiya]] and [[Koishi Komeiji]].

===Spin-offs===
;''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]''
Moriya Shrine is [[Sanae Kochiya]]'s home stage in ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]'', set on a plain at the base of a hill with the shrine itself at its peak. While the shrine does not appear in Story Mode, it is where Sanae first saw the [[Hisoutensoku|mysterious giant figure]], and where [[Suwako Moriya]] explains its true nature in her scenario ending.

;''[[Impossible Spell Card]]''
The ninth day of ''[[Impossible Spell Card]]'' takes place at Moriya Shrine, where [[Kanako Yasaka]], [[Suwako Moriya]], [[Mononobe no Futo]] and [[Suika Ibuki]] try to capture [[Seija Kijin]] with their "impossible" [[spell card]]s. There are 8 scenes total in the day. The previous day was located at the [[Shining Needle Castle]], whilst the next day is located at the [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]].

{{nihongo|'''Muenzuka'''|無縁塚||lit. "Mound of the Nameless"}} is a small, wooded area located at the end of the [[Road of Reconsideration]], known for its poisonous, deep red-colored [[Wikipedia:Lycoris radiata|red spider lilies]]. It is the graveyard of [[human]]s who don't have relatives (and are usually from outside [[Gensokyo]]). Many treasures from the [[Outside World]] make their way to Gensokyo by floating here.

==General Information==
Muenzuka is the resting place for the nameless dead. In [[Gensokyo]], where [[human]] corpses are not neglected due to the [[youkai]], the nameless corpses are cremated and laid to rest here. Because it is a place for the dead, and because humans quite often become [[phantom]]s after death, it is quite close to the [[Netherworld]], as well as the [[Outside World]]. Normally, the barriers do not intersect, but that is happening here. For this reason, maintaining one's presence within one realm is difficult. However, apparently people are known to appear here from the Outside World as well, happening to fall into it by chance. It is also the home of purple [[Wikipedia:Cherry blossom|cherry blossom]] trees, some of the most beautiful flower in Gensokyo. When the flowers of these cherry blossoms fall, the deceased of Muenzuka will be released from their hesitation and will finally progress to the [[Road of Liminality]].

The purple cherry blossoms purify the soil of Muenzuka, and once per year, bloom to sever all hesitation. Even for Gensokyo, these are quite peculiar youkai cherry trees. Those flower petals that drop by ones and twos create a sight reminiscent of Muenzuka itself weeping, an illusion that will beguile any viewer. This might be the most perfect place for [[Wikipedia:Hanami|flower viewing]], or so one might think, but the sorrowful sights create such sadness that there is no one who is able to make merry while watching them.

It is the residence of [[Nazrin]], who lives there in search of treasure.&lt;ref&gt;[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]]: [[Symposium of Post-mysticism/Nazrin|Nazrin]]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[Rinnosuke Morichika]] is known to go there often to collect goods for his shop [[Kourindou]]. Despite being a small area enclosed by trees, it is known to be one of the most dangerous place in [[Gensokyo]] for both the humans and youkai. 

==Background Information==
It is named after a Japanese Buddhist term {{nihongo|"muen-botoke"|無縁仏}}, meaning "a dead person or soul lacking their relatives by blood and marriage who arrange their grave".

==Muenzuka's Appearances==
===Games===
;''Phantasmagoria of Flower View''
Muenzuka appeared as a stage location in ''[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]'', in which [[Eiki Shiki, Yamaxanadu]] is dedicated to this location. The location is generally the final stage for most of the casts' scenarios, having Eiki as the final boss of the game. Eiki, who is lacking any souls to judge upon due to [[Komachi Onozuka]] slacking off, is interrupted by a number of various residents because they were curious on the number of flowers blooming, where Eiki ends up lecturing them on what negative personalities they've got and threatens to them to be sinned. They defeat her, only to find that the incident has yet not being cleared. On Eiki's scenario, [[Reimu Hakurei]] comes back here wondering why there are still a lot of spirits and flowers, thus being the final boss of Eiki's scenario located at Muenzuka.

===Spin-offs===
;''Shoot the Bullet''
Muenzuka appears in ''[[Shoot the Bullet]]'' on [[stage]] 10, the Final stage, and Ex-7 &amp; 8. On Stage 6, [[Aya Shameimaru]] encounters [[Komachi Onozuka]] and [[Eiki Shiki, Yamaxanadu]] to try and take photos of their [[danmaku]]. The previous stage is at [[Eientei]]. There are 8 scenes total within the stage. Notice from the image that there isn't as many red spider lilies as there were from the previous game. Additionally on the Extra stage, after Aya met [[Fujiwara no Mokou]] at Eientei, she will come here again to encounter [[Suika Ibuki]], trying to take photos of her danmaku. By this point, Aya should've complete the whole game.

{{nihongo|'''Mugenkan'''|夢幻館|Mugenkan|"mansion of fantasies"}} is a mysterious mansion located within the [[Lake of Blood]]. It is the final destination for the player in ''[[Lotus Land Story]]''.

==General Information==

===Geography===
The mansion itself apparently lies on the boundary between [[Gensokyo]] and the [[Fantasy World]]. Physically, this boundary is located beneath the [[Lake of Blood]] somehow, which is in the middle of a lake on a mountain behind the [[Hakurei Shrine]].

According to ''Lotus Land story''&lt;nowiki&gt;'s&lt;/nowiki&gt; manual, the fifth stage of the game is set in the innermost part of Mugenkan. The background is shown to be largely pitch black, with big blue stars scrolling by and slightly illuminating it.

===People===
[[Yuuka Kazami]] appears to be the sole occupant of the mansion, though [[Elly]] does guard the entrance, and [[Kurumi]] guards the lake on top of it.

===Appearance===
At the end of the third stage of ''[[Lotus Land Story]]'', there are lots of blue tiles on the ground in front of the door of Mugenkan, and the [[gatekeeper]] of the entrance [[Elly]] throws some of those tiles at the beginning of the boss battle.

On the fourth stage, there red checkerboard pattern floor that continues down a corridor, and somewhere in the middle of the stage, there are two six-starred magic circles.

On fifth stage, there are three floating blue checkerboard platforms, and below there are big blue transparent stars that moves down the screen constantly. Also below the stars, there appears to be a number of watches.

==Story==
During Stage 4 of ''[[Lotus Land Story]]'', the player first fights either [[Reimu Hakurei]] or [[Marisa Kirisame]], depending on which character the player is using. Following that, they battle Yuuka for the first time, who retreats deeper into the Fantasy World. The heroine chases after her and defeats her in Stage 6.

Mugetsu's world is where the extra stage of ''[[Lotus Land Story]]'' is set. Details about this place are unclear, save for the fact that [[Mugetsu]] claims it's hers&lt;ref&gt;''[[Lotus Land Story]]'': [[Lotus_Land_Story/Story/Reimu's_Extra|Reimu's Extra Scenario]]&lt;/ref&gt; and that she lives there with her older sister, [[Gengetsu]]. Its location or any relation to other realms (such as the [[Fantasy World]], where the main story of ''Lotus Land Story'' takes place) is unknown. The scenery is shown to be purple with an odd number of stars and having what appears to be black flooring.

[[Reimu Hakurei]] and [[Marisa Kirisame]] travel through here without reason. They are attacked by bizarre [[stage enemies]] and halfway though they encounter a [[Mysterious Orb]]. Towards the end, they encounter Mugetsu. Reimu says to her that she smells "evil energy", much to Mugetsu's confusion. With that, the two fight, and Mugetsu is defeated, leading to Gengetsu coming along. She fights the heroine, but is defeated. She wonders why the heroines came, but they reveal they had no reason.

The Palanquin Ship was created by [[Byakuren Hijiri]] and given to [[Minamitsu Murasa]] in order to win over her trust. The design itself is based on the ship that Minamitsu died on. It was eventually buried into the [[Underworld]] after Byakuren was sealed away by [[human]]s, but popped up on the surface of [[Gensokyo]] during the events of ''[[Subterranean Animism]]''. It was temporarily used as a simple granary, but was later renovated into a temple which was named after Byakuren's brother, [[Myouren Hijiri]].

The temple was purposely landed bang above the [[Hall of Dreams' Great Mausoleum]] so that Byakuren could keep an eye on the seal on [[Toyosatomimi no Miko]]; as a [[saint]] of [[human]]s, it's clear the two would naturally be at odds. Ironically, this choice ended up being exactly why the seal was broken in the first place. After the intervention of the main character in the events of ''[[Ten Desires]]'', the now-revived "residents" of the Mausoleum appear to have been pacified for the moment.

===The youkai at the temple===
There are many [[youkai]] at the temple training as monks under Byakuren in [[Buddhism]]. However, they are still inexperienced and undisciplined, as displayed during ''[[Ten Desires]]''. She seems to have her hands full with them, as many of the youkai can also be seen at parties, eating meat and drinking alcohol, both of which are prohibited in the Buddhist faith. Many notable youkai live or come here, such as [[Byakuren Hijiri]] (the Buddhist monk), [[Shou Toramaru]], [[Nazrin]], [[Ichirin Kumoi]] &amp; [[Unzan]] (Both are guards), [[Minamitsu Murasa]] (the captain of the ship), [[Nue Houjuu]], [[Kyouko Kasodani]], [[Mamizou Futatsuiwa]] and [[Koishi Komeiji]]. [[Kogasa Tatara]] also lives in the [[Myouren Temple Cemetery|cemetery]].

Byakuren has apparently turned away certain youkai from entering the temple, with the reason that those specific youkai would never be able to overcome being a natural enemy of humans. Two of the youkai in particular were [[Yamame Kurodani]] and [[Rin Kaenbyou]]. She also explains that the [[Underworld]] youkai in particular, who are living in what is essentially a society without rules, would be unfit for training under the Buddhist faith.

==Background Information==
The inspiration for the Palanquin Ship is the {{Nihongo|flying warehouse|飛倉|Tobi Kura}}, which appears in the first volume of [[Wikipedia:Shigisan-engi|Shigi san Engi Emaki]]. The story goes that Myouren made a bowl fly, so it was called the {{Nihongo|Flying Bowl|飛鉢|Hihatsu}}, for people to place offerings into. When a certain rich man suspected that Myouren might be skimming off the top, he shut the bowl in a closed storehouse. In return, Myouren made the whole storehouse fly, along with the bowl and the other stored supplies like bales of rice. The rich man asked Myouren to give back the supplies, so he did. After a long time, perhaps after long time passed since Myouren died, the Flying Storehouse fell into ruin, but it gained sacred power from his cloth which his sister gave to him. People wondered about it, so they removed pieces of it from the Storehouse.

The Palanquin Ship's name in Japanese is pronounced ''"Seirensen"'', identical to the Japanese title of ''[[Undefined Fantastic Object]]''. The kanji on the sail is "&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;{{lang|ja|寶}}&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;", an archaic version of "{{lang|ja|宝}}" meaning "treasure".

==The Temple's Appearances==
===Games===
;''Undefined Fantastic Object''
The Palanquin Ship first appeared in its ship form on Stage 3 of ''[[Undefined Fantastic Object]]''. It was flying over the [[skies of Gensokyo‎]], and thus made the heroine believe that it was some sort of treasure ship. So they've set off to investigate. They'll fly over the outside of this ship, when simultaneously fighting [[Fairy|fairies]], [[flying yin-yangs]] and collecting [[Seed of Unknown Form]] without realising. [[Ichirin Kumoi]] and [[Unzan]] appear as the midboss and [[boss]] of the stage. They'll inform the heroine that there's no treasure and realise that they've been collecting fragments. Eventually, they'll defeat Ichirin, and they'll enter the ship for Stage 4. They expect to find treasure, but the ship is empty, as it had been lying underground for over a thousand years. [[Minamitsu Murasa]] will either try to kick the heroine out of the ship or keep them in for the needed fragments, but either way she is defeated. Regardless, the ship is piloted with the heroine into [[Makai]] after Stage 4. After the events of ''Undefined Fantastic Object'', the ship returns to [[Gensokyo]] and lands near the [[Human Village]]. [[Suwako Moriya]] &amp; [[Kanako Yasaka]] helped build the shrine, as Sanae had offered the Moriya Shrine's help in exchange for passage back out of Makai (Sanae couldn't escape on her own).&lt;ref&gt;''[[Undefined Fantastic Object]]'': Sanae's ending&lt;/ref&gt;

;''Ten Desires''
The temple serves as the setting of Stage 2, 3 and the Extra Stage of ''[[Ten Desires]]''. The heroines approach the temple in search of answers on Stage 2 as to the recent outbreak of [[divine spirit]]s, fighting various [[Fairy|fairies]] and [[flying yin-yangs]], where they'll be confronted by the new monk-in-training [[Kyouko Kasodani]], who attempts to drive them away. She is the midboss and [[boss]] of the stage, but is defeated. Stage 3 reveals a [[Myouren Temple Cemetery|graveyard]] adjacent to the temple, where the heroine will additionally fight divine spirits. [[Kogasa Tatara]], the midboss, will jump out for help because of an unusual youkai, but was defeated. After, [[Yoshika Miyako]], the [[boss]] of the stage, is guarding the entrance to the [[Hall of Dreams' Great Mausoleum]], but was defeated.

===Spin-offs===
;''Double Spoiler''
The temple (in its ship form) appears in ''[[Double Spoiler]]'' on [[stage]] 5, where [[Aya Shameimaru]] and [[Hatate Himekaidou]] encounters [[Minamitsu Murasa]], [[Ichirin Kumoi]] and [[Kisume]] to try and take photos of their [[danmaku]]. The previous stage is at the [[Untrodden Valley]] at the [[Youkai Mountain]], whilst the next stage is at the [[Former Capital]] in [[Former Hell]], [[Underworld]]. There are 8 scenes total on this stage.

;''Hopeless Masquerade''
During the events of ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'', both the temple and its original ship form is used as [[stage]] locations, where [[Ichirin Kumoi]] &amp; [[Unzan]] uses the ship while [[Byakuren Hijiri]] uses the temple.

;''Impossible Spell Card''
The road that leads to the temple appears on the second day of ''[[Impossible Spell Card]]'', where [[Seija Kijin]] carries on defending herself from other [[youkai]] who are trying to capture her. She'll fight against both [[Kyouko Kasodani]] and [[Sekibanki]] as they try to capture her with their "impossible" [[spell card]]s. There are 6 scenes total in the day. The previous day was at the [[Misty Lake]], whilst the next day is located at the [[Bamboo Forest of the Lost]].

;''Urban Legend in Limbo''
Again in ''[[Urban Legend in Limbo]]'', both the temple and its original ship form is used as [[stage]] locations, where [[Ichirin Kumoi]] &amp; [[Unzan]] uses the ship while [[Byakuren Hijiri]] uses the temple.

The {{nihongo|'''Myouren Temple Cemetery'''|命蓮寺墓地|Myourenji bochi}} is a cemetery, as its name suggest, found near the [[Myouren Temple]]. The Cemetery is very old and may possibly have been part of the [[Hall of Dreams' Great Mausoleum]] and was either built before or after it.{{cn}} It appears as though the cemetery is currently under the property of Myouren Temple itself, as the name suggests.

==General Information==
Not much is actually known about the cemetery. Just like any other cemetery however, it is full of gravestones. They appear to be under [[Wikipedia:Cherry blossom|cherry blossom]] trees, and incense's smoke can be seen coming out of some of the gravestones. [[Yoshika Miyako]], a [[Jiang Shi|jiang shi]] controlled by [[Seiga Kaku]], appeared here during ''[[Ten Desires]]'' to try and chase away the intruding heroines from the [[Hall of Dreams' Great Mausoleum]]. It is unknown if she still lurks here, but she was shown here as of ''[[Impossible Spell Card]]''. [[Kogasa Tatara]] also seems to lurk around here, exploiting the creepiness of the cemetery to scare people, since she finds it easier to surprise people here.&lt;ref name="SoPmKogasa" /&gt;

==Cemetery's Appearances==
===Games===
;''Ten Desires''
The cemetery first appeared as the [[Stage]] 3 location of ''[[Ten Desires]]''. The heroine will come here after roaming the path of the [[Myouren Temple]] itself, finding that the [[divine spirit]]s are travelling to this specific area, fighting these spirits, [[Fairy|fairies]] and [[Sunflower Fairy|sunflower fairies]]. [[Kogasa Tatara]] is the midboss of the stage, who requests the extermination of a strange [[youkai]] who is keeping a watch out, but she is also exterminated for simply being there. After going deeper into the cemetery and fighting more enemies, the heroine will encounter [[Yoshika Miyako]] the [[boss]] of the stage. She is a [[Jiang Shi|jiang shi]] controlled by [[Seiga Kaku]], trying to chase away the intruding heroines. She was, however, defeated, and thus the heroine will go down a hole on Stage 4 that leads to the [[Hall of Dreams' Great Mausoleum]].

===Spin-offs===
;''Impossible Spell Card''
The cemetery appears on the fourth day of ''[[Impossible Spell Card]]'', where [[Seija Kijin]] carries on defending herself from other [[youkai]] who are trying to capture her. A red glow appears to be coming from a distance of the cemetery. She'll fight against [[Yuyuko Saigyouji]], [[Seiga Kaku]] and [[Yoshika Miyako]] as they try to capture her with their "impossible" [[spell card]]s. There are 7 scenes total in the day. On Scene 2 with the spell card ''Demonify "Excessive Zouhuo Rumo"'', Seija will be fighting both Seiga and Yoshika. The previous day was at the [[Bamboo Forest of the Lost]], whilst the next day is located at the [[Skies of Gensokyo]].

The {{nihongo|'''Mysterious Cherry Blossom Path'''|桜怪道|Sakura Kai Michi}} is a mysterious purple-coloured path, as said in it's name, with cherry blossoms on it. The cherry blossoms may be seasonal as it was spring during the time the location appeared in the Extra Stage of ''Fairy Wars''. It's unknown what the path leads to and where its located in [[Gensokyo]]. It hasn't been shown or referenced again since the events of the Extra Stage. In-universe, it appears to be nameless.

==Path's Appearances==
===Games===
;''Fairy Wars''
The path was the location for the Extra [[Stage]] of ''[[Fairy Wars]]'', where [[Cirno]] travels down this path, fighting [[Fairy|fairies]] with bizarre [[danmaku]] and wanting to fight a [[youkai]], but ends up fighting the ordinary [[human]] [[Marisa Kirisame]] (the [[boss]]) who just finished with her flower viewing.

==Additional Information==
*In the data files of ''[[Fairy Wars]]'', the image used for the background of the Extra Stage is, apart from different colouring, exactly the same as the background images used for the [[Spring Path]] of the same game.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1594">{{nihongo|'''Mystery Spot'''|ミステリースポット|Misuterīsupotto}} and {{nihongo|'''Power Spot'''|パワースポット|Pawāsupotto}} are a concentration of spiritual energy, often found in the [[Outside World]], where the paranormal is likely to occur.

''Power Spots'' are derisively referred to by [[Kanako Yasaka]] as quick, convenient places where one can go to temporarily gain power. While having the potential for spiritual training, they're almost never used that way, but rather for a quick "power-up" due to the nature of Outside World humans who no longer believe.

''Mystery Spots'' are where [[ghost|ghosts]] actually do appear, some even traveling from [[Gensokyo]] and the [[Netherworld]] to visit. It is proposed that the [[Great Hakurei Barrier]] does not actually have much effect on them, allowing them to travel freely. Well-known haunted Mystery Spots, like cemeteries, hospitals, and schools often wind up as tourist attractions where Trial of Guts are held. Uninhabited shrines and temples also tend to make for ideal Mystery Spots.

The [[Secret Sealing Club]] has particular interest in the paranormal activity of these Mystery and Power Spots. A book about Japan's Power Spots exists, titled {{nihongo|Japan's Power Spots Encyclopedia|日本のパワースポット大全。}}.&lt;ref&gt;[[Symposium of Post-mysticism/Part 2]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Urban Legend in Limbo]]'', Mystery Spots play a pivotal role. It is from here that the [[Occult Ball|Occult Balls]] were collected by [[Sumireko Usami]].

The {{nihongo|'''Netherworld'''|冥界|Meikai|lit. Dark World}} is the land where [[ghost]]s and [[phantom]]s reside after death. After a phantom has been judged by the [[Yama]], they'll either go to [[Hell]], [[Heaven]] or to the Netherworld. The world frequently appears in various ''[[Touhou Project]]'' games and Manga, making it an important location.

==General Information==
The threat level in the Netherworld is 'high' and encounterable [[youkai]] include [[phantom]]s, [[ghost]]s and other types of [[spirit]]s. After death, humans pass through the [[Road of Liminality]], cross over the [[Sanzu River]], and receive the [[Yama]]'s judgement. Depending on the severity of their crimes, they are sent to either [[Hell]], [[Heaven]], or the Netherworld. Amongst these, the Netherworld is where the dead who aren't deemed sinful enough to be sent to Hell spend their time as phantoms, until they achieve Nirvana, and thus become able to enter Heaven, or reincarnate.

Different from the desolate Hell, the Netherworld is calm, though it has various seasons. It is filled with beautiful cherry blossoms in spring, and dyed with beautiful red leaves in autumn. The Netherworld is a notable place for people in the know for their cherry blossom viewing parties. The animals here are also dead, so they fly in the sky silently and splendidly. Like the [[Lunar Capital]], it is a [[Pure Land]] where things do not change or decay with time&lt;ref&gt;''[[Cage in Lunatic Runagate]]'': [[Cage in Lunatic Runagate/Last Chapter|Last Chapter]]&lt;/ref&gt;; things from the Netherworld which seem old were simply made that way for [[wikipedia:Wabi-sabi|aesthetic reasons]]&lt;ref&gt;''[[Immaterial and Missing Power]]'': Yuyuko good ending&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[Hakugyokurou]], located in the Netherworld, is where two notable Touhou [[characters]] live: [[Youmu Konpaku]] and [[Yuyuko Saigyouji]]. The former is a gardener and the latter is the "princess" of the land. The manor is a beautiful structure, surrounded by walls and stairs using designs from the continent, and has a Japanese-style residence and [[Wikipedia:Japanese rock garden|Zen garden]] at its highest level. The entrance to the manor is a very long stairway called {{nihongo|"Hakugyokurou's Stairway"|白玉楼階段|Hakugyokurou Kaidan}}.

Even though the dead comprise most of the Netherworld's inhabitants, the Netherworld is a distinct part of [[Gensokyo]]. However, travelling between the two is restricted by a gate above the clouds, sealed by the [[Barrier of Life &amp; Death]]. During the main events of ''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]'', a hole opened in the barrier between the Netherworld and Gensokyo, and it has become easier to travel between them. This is because the barrier was weakened by [[Yuyuko Saigyouji]], making it possible to simply fly over the gate, and [[Reimu Hakurei]] (in her scenario) was able to destroy it. Afterwards, [[Yukari Yakumo]] was asked to repair the damage, but apparently never got around to it, as the boundary continues to thin through the [[Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red/Youmu|summer of ''Imperishable Night'']].

==Netherworld's Appearances==
===Windows Games===
;''Perfect Cherry Blossom''
The Netherworld first appeared as the centre of the main events of ''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]'', being the location of stage 5 and the Final Stage. The spring was taken from [[Gensokyo]] and placed in the Netherworld in order to fully bloom the [[Saigyou Ayakashi]], a [[youkai]] cherry blossom tree that, unknown to [[Yuyuko Saigyouji]], holds her dead body inside. After the heroines went across the [[Barrier of Life &amp; Death]] in Stage 4, they went up [[Hakugyokurou]]'s Stairs, in Stage 5, fighting ghostly [[Fairy|fairies]], but then encountered [[Youmu Konpaku]]. She warned the heroines that coming to the Netherworld is forbidden amongst the living, but was eventually defeated. After going deeper into the Netherworld on Stage 6 to [[Hakugyokurou]]'s garden, they encountered Yuyuko, the final boss of the game.

Ten days later,&lt;ref&gt;[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]: [[Perfect Cherry Blossom/Story/Marisa's Extra|Marisa's Extra Scenario]]&lt;/ref&gt; the heroines re-entered the Netherworld as part of the Extra and Phantasm stages. In the Extra Stage, the heroines tried to find the one who was not repairing the barrier between the Netherworld and Gensokyo. They fought bizarre ghostly [[Fairy|fairies]] and [[spinning enemies]], as well as bumped into [[Chen]]. Some time later, they encountered [[Ran Yakumo]], only to discover that her mistress was asleep and that Ran was guarding her. After what was considered an unnecessary, long battle, Ran was defeated, and the heroines had to come back at night. This formed the precedent for the Phantasm Stage, which is similar to the Extra, but more difficult. After fighting more bizarre ghostly [[Fairy|fairies]], Ran re-appeared as a midboss, only to be defeated again. Eventually, [[Yukari Yakumo]] appeared, with the heroine demanding that she should fix the barrier. She still didn't fix the barrier even after defeat.

;''Phantasmagoria of Flower View''
The Netherworld appeared as [[Youmu Konpaku]]'s stage location in ''[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]'' at [[Hakugyokurou]]'s Stairs. The stage generally appears on stage 3, 4 or 5 of most of the playable characters' scenarios, but on 6 in [[Lyrica Prismriver]]'s scenario. Various characters will come here to look for leads on the flower incident, only to find and defeat Youmu, and discover that the flower incident has not spread to the Netherworld; only in [[Gensokyo]]. In [[Eiki Shiki, Yamaxanadu]]'s scenario, she'll come here to see if Youmu has been keeping up with what she (was supposed to have) learnt from the [[Yama]], which she hasn't.

;''Ten Desires''
The Netherworld once again appears in ''[[Ten Desires]]'' on [[Stage]] 1, where [[ZUN]] states that it's "been a while since we last went to the Netherworld". The heroines immediately thought that the cause of overflowing [[divine spirit]]s was coming from here, only to find that [[Yuyuko Saigyouji]] does not know anything about it. She is the stage's [[boss]], and a random divine spirit is the midboss. Yuyuko points the heroines towards the [[Myouren Temple]] following her defeat. In [[Youmu Konpaku]]'s scenario, Yuyuko forbade Youmu from leaving the Netherworld to further investigate the incident unless she could defeat her, which she soon did. 

;Wily Beast and Weakest Creature

===Spin-offs===
;''Shoot the Bullet''
The Netherworld frequently appears on ''[[Shoot the Bullet]]'', specifically on [[stage]]s 6, 8 and Ex-3 &amp; 4. On Stage 6, [[Aya Shameimaru]] encounters [[Chen]] and [[Youmu Konpaku]] to try and take photos of their [[danmaku]]. The previous stage and the next stage are both at the [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]]. After the mansion on Stage 7, Aya will come back here and encounter [[Ran Yakumo]] and [[Yuyuko Saigyouji]] to try and take photos of their [[danmaku]] in [[Hakugyokurou]] garden. There are 8 scenes on both stage 6 and 8. Additionally on the Extra stage, after Aya met [[Flandre Scarlet]] at the mansion, she will come here again to encounter [[Yukari Yakumo]], trying to take photos of her [[danmaku]]. Aya will then fight [[Fujiwara no Mokou]] on Ex-5 and 6 at [[Eientei]].

;''Impossible Spell Card''
The Netherworld appears on the seventh day of ''[[Impossible Spell Card]]'', where [[Seija Kijin]] finds herself here and carries on defending herself from stronger [[human]]s and [[youkai]] who are trying to capture her. She'll fight against [[Marisa Kirisame]], [[Sakuya Izayoi]], [[Youmu Konpaku]] and [[Sanae Kochiya]] as they try to capture her with their "impossible" [[spell card]]s.

The {{nihongo|'''Nuclear Furnace'''|核融合炉|Kakuyuugouro}} is a super-high furnace that's used for high-temperature heating, in an attempt to tame a power that the [[Outside World]] apparently won't master for hundreds of years: nuclear fusion energy. It is located at one of the deepest layers of the [[Underworld]], just below the [[Remains of Blazing Hell]], but one layer above the [[Hell of Blood Pools]].

==General Information==
It produces the heat and power for the [[Former Hell]] and that it's connected to the [[Underground Geyser Center]] via a very long passageway. [[Utsuho Reiuji]] can be found here to power it and [[Rin Kaenbyou]] carts corpses into the Furnace to keep it running. [[Kanako Yasaka]] and [[Suwako Moriya]] were looking for a high temperature, high pressure furnace to revolutionize the [[kappa]]'s energy production and thus made use of the [[Remains of Blazing Hell]] due to not being used and Utsuho helped them to create the Furnace. It's now being utilized by the kappa of the [[Youkai Mountain]] as part of their Mountain Industrial Revolution project. In ''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'', Kanako and Suwako attempt to develop a better version of the nuclear fusion, probably as a way to convert the current Nuclear Furnace into something more efficient. It used to lie dormant, but because of the plans of [[Kanako Yasaka]] and [[Suwako Moriya]], it is now fully active.

==Furnace's Appearances==
===Games===
;''Subterranean Animism''
The Nuclear Furnace is the setting of the Final Stage in ''[[Subterranean Animism]]''. It is the place that caused the events of the game by creating geysers, but also has an indirect impact on the events of the later games, namely ''[[Undefined Fantastic Object]]'' and ''[[Ten Desires]]'', because it cause the [[Palanquin Ship]] to escape from the [[Underworld]]. Utsuho misunderstood what [[Kanako Yasaka]] had told her, and decided that, using these powers, she would take over [[Gensokyo]]. [[Rin Kaenbyou]] then drove [[vengeful spirit]]s above ground to attract strong [[youkai]] to deal with her, but a [[human]] came instead. After the heroine fled through the [[Remains of Blazing Hell]], fighting vengeful spirits and [[raven]]s, Rin will battle once more. After she was defeated, they'll do a little bit more roaming, and finally move upwards into the furnace, where they meet Utsuho, the Final Boss. After discovering that she wanted to take over Gensokyo, they go into a duel, and she was finally defeated. After this event and finding out who gave Utsuho her power, the heroine will go to the [[Moriya Shrine]] on the Extra stage as to why this furnace is here, only to find that that the entire event was a misunderstanding.

===Spin-offs===
;''Touhou Hisoutensoku''
The Furnace appeared as a [[stage]] location in ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]''. In [[Sanae Kochiya]]'s scenario, she'll come here after following [[Hisoutensoku]], but instead fights [[Utsuho Reiuji]].

The {{nihongo|'''Outside World'''|外の世界|soto no sekai|also called the {{nihongo|'''Human World'''|人間界|Ningen-Kai}}&lt;ref name="BAiJRScarlet"&gt;''[[Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red]]'': [[Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red/Scarlet Mist Incident|Scarlet Mist Incident]]&lt;/ref&gt; or '''Another World'''{{cn}}}}, is, in reality, the non-fictional world of fact and reality we all live in. In the ''[[Touhou Project]]'', the outside world is commonly referenced by many of its residents, as shown throughout the games and manga, where it's location is outside [[Gensokyo]] and all its residents are aware of the outside world, whereas on the other hand almost all the creatures of the outside world are unaware of the existence of [[Gensokyo]] as the [[Great Hakurei Barrier]] keeps it all sealed away. [[Sumireko Usami‎]] once tried to expose Gensokyo to the outside world in ''[[Urban Legend in Limbo]]'' by breaking the barrier, but it's presumed she failed. While it was thought that no [[youkai]] live in the outside world anymore, some may be left as with the case of [[Mamizou Futatsuiwa]].

==General Information==
[[File:SaBNDOutsideWorld.png|thumb|250px|left|A city seen through [[Yukari Yakumo]]'s [[gap]] in ''[[Strange and Bright Nature Deity]]'']]
Seen through [[Yukari Yakumo]]'s [[gap]] and ''[[Urban Legend in Limbo]]'', the outside world has a modernised civilisation that [[Gensokyo]] doesn't have.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Strange and Bright Nature Deity]]'': Chapter 25&lt;/ref&gt; Even though it's impossible to pass through the [[Great Hakurei Barrier]], it's still very easy to enter by simply getting lost while wandering around, but humans are still unaware that they've entered another world. This leads them to great danger if they were eaten by [[youkai]], should they fail to find the [[Human Village]] or the [[Hakurei Shrine]]. If they find the village, they'll be escorted safely to the shrine and be able to return to their world once again. They'll just think they entered a mysterious place and usually think it was just an illusion, then later forget about it. If outsiders refuse to return back to their world, they're forced to take up residence in the [[Human Village]], however, they rarely choose to stay.

Our world is confusing for the residents of [[Gensokyo]], and even [[Hieda no Akyuu]] doesn't fully understand it. However, it's been shown that [[Yukari Yakumo]] has outside world understanding. When an object is forgotten about and/or not seen by humans for a very long time, it gets transported to Gensokyo. [[Rinnosuke]] tends to find objects from our world as they sometimes fall near the [[Kourindou]].

[[Maribel Hearn]], [[Renko Usami]] and [[Sumireko Usami‎]] are currently the only named official characters known to live in the outside world today, in [[Kyoto]], [[Japan]], but Sumireko is unknown. These three people know the existence of Gensokyo, where Sumireko created the [[Secret Sealing Club]] to try and expose Gensokyo, much to [[Kasen Ibaraki]]'s anger. [[Mamizou Futatsuiwa]] formerly lived in [[Sado]] before moving to Gensokyo to help [[Nue Houjuu]] in ''[[Ten Desires]]'', and ended taking up residents in Gensokyo. The [[hobgoblin]]s were also transported into Gensokyo by Yukari, and were one of the few youkai who still lived in the outside world during the modern era. [[Layla Prismriver]] formerly lived in a mansion that is now called a poltergeist mansion called the [[Ruined Western Mansion]] which was located in the outside world, but was transported into [[Gensokyo]] by the invocation of an unknown ritual. She may now be deceased.

Outside the ''[[Touhou Project]]'', [[Isami Asama]], [[Tatsumi Hakkaisan]], [[Rumi Arie]] and [[Amakasu Barley Tenji]], who are known to be at the [[Twilight Bar Room]], which is the setting of ''[[Uwabami Breakers]]'', are also somewhere in the outside world where only drunkards live, in Japan. Their exact location is unknown.  

Some residences and locations in [[Gensokyo]] used to belong to the outside world. Examples include:
*The [[Moriya Shrine]], moved from [[Wikipedia:Lake Suwa|Lake Suwa]] to Gensokyo in order to gather more faith. It moved with [[Sanae Kochiya]], [[Kanako Yasaka]] and [[Suwako Moriya]]; 
*The [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]], a European mansion that was moved to Gensokyo simply because it was forgotten. It moved with [[Remilia Scarlet]] and [[Flandre Scarlet]];
*The [[Poltergeist Mansion]], transported into Gensokyo by the invocation of an unknown ritual. It moved with the [[Prismriver Sisters]];
*The [[Probability Space Hypervessel]], implied to have stayed in Gensokyo the second time around. It carried [[Chiyuri Kitashirakawa]] and [[Yumemi Okazaki]].
*The [[Hall of Dreams' Great Mausoleum]], being based on the real life Hall of Dreams, was formerly of the outside world before people started to believe [[Toyosatomimi no Miko]] was fictional, and was transported to Gensokyo.

==The Outside World at Different Times &amp; Places==
===The Outside World in "the near future"===
There isn't much directly stated about the outside world from the time period that [[Maribel Hearn]] and [[Renko Usami]] live in. ''[[Ghostly Field Club]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s synopsis states "an age that knows not of Gensokyo," ''Changeability of Strange Dream'''s synopsis states "changing future nightmares into sweet dreams," and both ''[[Retrospective 53 minutes]]'' and ''[[Magical Astronomy]]'' feature narratives that speak of various events that have happened to the world since after present times, showing that Maribel and Renko live in the future. However, one can infer some things based on various off-hand comments by Maribel and Renko.

For one thing, it doesn't seem to be a particularly happy time, as Maribel says "When was the last time I've seen children smiling so?" and "I thought I also always wanted to in such a country where I can see this kind of smile on these children."&lt;ref name="CoSD"&gt;''[[Changeability of Strange Dream]]''&lt;/ref&gt; It isn't completely devoid of happiness, as there are eating contests in Tokyo, beautiful displays of Mt. Fuji via a half-panoramic film on the train, and lots of chatter surrounding the moon tours. However, the scenic film of Mt. Fuji feels empty to Maribel and the Moon Tours are too expensive for her (and presumably the average person, given that the situation is likely based off of [[ZUN]]'s feelings about wondering if an average person could ever afford going to the moon in his comments at the end.)

The outside world also appears to have environmental issues. Maribel comments that she's only ever seen synthetic bamboo shoots,&lt;ref name="CoSD" /&gt; And the cake she's eaten in ''Magical Astronomy'' is made with synthetic strawberries. ''Retrospective 53 Minutes'' mentions that Mt. Fuji's beauty was restored due to the Mt. Fuji Revival Association. Humanity seems to have become obsessed with environmentalism, as ''[[Neo-traditionalism of Japan]]'' states "Due to extreme environmentalism, cities have been decorated to look like forests. Like a painted jungle, there is no natural vegetation."

Things are also highly advanced in general. The aforementioned Mt. Fuji train film and the moon tours being an example. Humanity has even launched a satellite into space filled with various forms of life that ended up developing its own eco-system (albeit without them realizing it). ''Magical Astronomy'' mentions that "It was just recently that gravitational force, which had been proven long ago and tormented physicists for a long time, was unified with the other forces," showing that the grand unified theory has been solved.

===The Outside World in ''[[Phantasmagoria of Dim.Dream]]''===
'''Take note that the [[canon]]icity of the [[PC-98]] and [[Windows]] can come into play.''' [[Yumemi Okazaki]] and [[Chiyuri Kitashirakawa]] came to Gensokyo in the [[Probability Space Hypervessel]]. In the world they come from, a grand unified theory has been completed, and it's normal to graduate college at the age of 11 and graduate school at 13.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Phantasmagoria of Dim.Dream]]:'' OMAKE.TXT&lt;/ref&gt; It's not explicitly stated that they, along with the Probability Space Hypervessel, came from the outside world. However, whatever world they come from, it too has solved the grand unified theory.

Unfortunately, Maribel and Renko's ages (the two girls are university students) are never stated to compare against Chiyuri's age. But it's known that Yumemi's a [[human]] just like [[Reimu Hakurei]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Phantasmagoria of Dim.Dream]]'': Reimu's ending&lt;/ref&gt; This could imply she's from the outside world (unless there are other worlds where humans come from).

There are other statements that support that Yumemi and Chiyuri come from the future (which, combined with them being humans, would imply they come from the future of the outside world). Chiyuri snaps "Cut it out already! If you do that we'll end up as '''historic''' criminals!" when she stops Yumemi from (jokingly) threatening to blow up the planet. [[Rikako Asakura]] comments that Yumemi's technology appears to be 5 centuries ahead of Gensokyo's technology (Gensokyo, and thus its technology, was only really fully sealed off from the outside world a century or two ago). Also, Chiyuri's title is "Resident of Fantasy That ''Runs Through Time''".

Yumemi and Chiyuri's world appears to have huge environmental issues, too, as Yumemi hopes that she can lecture on how magic and religion will solve her world's "energy and environmental problems".

As an aside, in both Yumemi's and Chiyuri's storylines and endings, they worry that the duplicates of them will cause an energy imbalance, which apparently is a crime in their world. Chiyuri also laments, "The Parallelism Police will crack down on us." This would seem to indicate that technology has progressed to the point where time travel or parallel dimensions is commonplace enough that a police force and laws had to be created to regulate it.

==={{H:title|Seihou World|This name is unofficial.}}===
{{Main|Seihou World}}
This is the primary setting of the ''[[Seihou Project]]'' games, where it's set in the future. Due to [[canon]]icity with the ''[[Touhou Project]]'', for the world of Seihou to be "in the future" as part of the outside world is unclear. See article for more information.

==Appearances==
It's common for residents of Gensokyo to make reference to the outside world.

===Spin-offs===
;''Scarlet Weather Rhapsody''
The Outside World makes a cameo in ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]''. During [[Tenshi Hinanawi]]'s final spell, she'll take you up high in the sky on pillars, to the extent where you can see both space and Earth, thus seeing over the horizon.

;''Urban Legend in Limbo''
For the first time, the outside world was shown as a [[stage]] location in ''[[Urban Legend in Limbo]]'', as well as the first game to show fighting and other Touhou characters apart from [[Yukari Yakumo]] and [[Mamizou Futatsuiwa]] physically in the outside world on Earth. It's usually the final stage of a character's scenario, where you'll fight [[Sumireko Usami‎]], an outside-world exception to using magic and flying. She is obsessed with other worlds and became a psychic. With this, she created a trap of sort, by spreading an urban legend across [[Gensokyo]] by collecting 7 [[Occult Ball]]s in order to transport a Gensokyo resident to the outside world. This creates a gap that breaks the [[Great Hakurei Barrier]], thus causing issues. By gathering information from this person, Sumireko will be able to expose Gensokyo to the outside world. However, it's presumed that she failed. The stage itself is covered by large skyscrapers at night, and it's presumed that no [[human|outsider]] sees any of these fights in the sky because the streets appear to be empty.

===Music CDs===
As the stories of the ''[[ZUN's Music Collection]]'' mainly focus on [[Maribel Hearn]] and [[Renko Usami]], the outside world is therefore the prime location of these stories.

The {{nihongo|'''Palace of the Earth Spirits'''|地霊殿|Chireiden}} is a mansion situated in the center of what used to be [[Hell]] (now [[Former Hell]]) in the [[Underworld]], and is near the [[Former Capital]].

==General Information==
The palace is a Western-style mansion with what appears to be many stained glass windows on a chequered floor. In the courtyard is a large hole that leads to the [[Hell of Blazing Fires]] below. It's said that the Palace was constructed after the [[Underworld]] was separated from Hell. 

[[Satori Komeiji]] took control of the Palace and managed it by herself with the help of her pets, keeping it relatively peaceful. Of her pets, [[Rin Kaenbyou]]'s duty is to carry corpses to the [[Remains of Blazing Hell]] for the heating of Former Hell and [[Utsuho Reiuji]] is to maintain that heat. The other pets' duties were said to be tending the garden and playing with Satori's sister, [[Koishi Komeiji]].

==The Palace's Appearances==
===Games===
;''Subterranean Animism''
The palace appears in ''[[Subterranean Animism]]'' on Stage 4. After [[Yuugi Hoshiguma]] pointed the heroine to come here on Stage 3 at the [[Former Capital]], they'll roam through the palace, where they'll fight various [[Fairy|fairies]] and [[flying yin-yangs]], also encountering [[Rin Kaenbyou]] in her [[cat]] form twice as a midboss. After more roaming, the heroine, will encounter [[Satori Komeiji]]. After they've had a battle, Satori will point the heroines towards the courtyard that leads to the [[Remains of Blazing Hell]] for the cause of geysers and [[vengeful spirit]]s in [[Gensokyo]].

===Spin-offs===
The palace made an appearance as a [[stage]] location in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'' and ''[[Urban Legend in Limbo]]'', despite being located far away from other locations in these games. It is associated with [[Koishi Komeiji]]. In the latter game, an [[Occult Ball]] ended up here in Marisa's scenario.

{{nihongo|'''Phantom Meadow'''|幻草原|Maboroshi sōgen}} is a treeless field that's covered with unknown yellow and red coloured flowers. Nothing is known about this place, nor is its location.

==General Information==
It's thought to be located not far beyond the [[Giant Toad's Pond]] or the [[Road of Reconsideration]] as leads to the main source of the event are not local. Apparently, [[Sakuya Izayoi]] state there's enough ingredients here to make [[Wikipedia:Jasmine tea|Jasmine tea]]. There can be other possible translations to the kanji {{lang|ja|幻}} other than "phantom", such as "illusion" or "vision".

==Meadow's Appearance==
;''Phantasmagoria of Flower View''
The stage once appeared as a stage location in ''[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]'', dedicated to [[Sakuya Izayoi]]. Many characters come to this place during the game, where the stage appears in many scenarios, encountering Sakuya, only to find that there are no leads to the flower incident. In [[Eiki Shiki, Yamaxanadu]]'s scenario, she'll come here to see if Sakuya has been keeping up with what she (supposed to have) learnt by the [[yama]], which she hasn't.

The {{nihongo|'''Primate Spirit Garden'''|霊長園|Reichouen}} is a large park resembling a [[wikipedia:Kofun|kofun]] burial mound, located in the [[Animal Realm]]. While it's typically a lush, natural location, part of it was transformed into a high-tech fortress by [[Keiki Haniyasushin]] during the events of ''[[Wily Beast and Weakest Creature]]''.

==General Information== 
As the one major location in the Animal Realm that's lush with nature, the Garden is typically treated as a recreation spot by the resident animal spirits, as well as a place of captivity for the realm's human spirits. It bears a strong resemblance to the real-world [[wikipedia:Mozu_Tombs|Daisenryou Kofun]], with a swamp surrounding the keyhole-shaped central island.

During ''[[Wily Beast and Weakest Creature]]'', one of the Garden's main buildings was remodeled into a fortress by [[Keiki Haniyasushin]] as part of a hostile takeover to liberate the human spirits. The interior of the fortress is covered in holographic panels with a sci-fi aesthetic, featuring stylized icons of [[wikipedia:Haniwa|haniwa]] in certain places. The fortress may have been dismantled after Keiki's defeat.

==Basis==
The [[wikipedia:Mozu_Tombs|Daisenryou Kofun]] is the largest kofun in Japan, commonly accepted (though not outright confirmed) to be the tomb of [[wikipedia:Emperor Nintoku|Emperor Nintoku]]. Its approval as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2019 was part of ZUN's inspiration for the in-game location, according to the game's [[Strange_Creators_of_Outer_World/Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature_Interview_with_ZUN|''Strange Creators of Outer World'' interview]].

The {{Nihongo|'''Probability Space Hypervessel'''|可能性空間移動船|kanōsei kūkan idō sen}} is a large ship that [[Yumemi Okazaki]], its captain, and [[Chiyuri Kitashirakawa]], a crew member, used to travel to [[Gensokyo]] in search of proving the existence of magic. It's implied that the vessel is quite large, because most of the residents of Gensokyo took it to be ordinary ruins of some sort. It ends up becoming the main location in the events of ''[[Phantasmagoria of Dim.Dream]]''.

==Appearances==
In the game, Chiyuri secretly handed out pamphlets about a new "Fantasy Ruins" in [[Gensokyo]], where a prize will be given to grant them happiness, but a note outside the ruins said that only one person can enter. [[Reimu Hakurei]], [[Mima]], [[Marisa Kirisame]] and others decided to fight each other until that's one winner who's able to enter. The person who enters encounters Chiyuri then Yumemi within and discovers that it is in fact a ship. Once that person defeats the two, they're given a prize as promise. At the end of the game, Yumemi and Chiyuri take this ship back to [[Outside World]], but come back to Gensokyo later because Yumemi was kicked out of the university she was teaching at.

==Time Machine Possibility==
There's possible statements that support the fact that the giant ship is a time machine and that Yumemi and Chiyuri come from the future (which, combined with them being [[human]]s, would imply they come from the future of the [[Outside World]]). Chiyuri snaps "Cut it out already! If you do that we'll end up as ''historic'' criminals!" when she stops Yumemi from (jokingly) threatening to blow up the planet. [[Rikako Asakura]] comments that Yumemi's technology appears to be 5 centuries ahead of Gensokyo's technology (Gensokyo, and thus its technology, was only really fully sealed off from the outside world a century or two ago). Also, Chiyuri's title is "Resident of Fantasy That Runs Through Time".

The {{nihongo|'''Rainbow Cavern of Earth Spirits'''|地霊虹洞|Chirei Kōdō}} is an underground passage located in the [[Forest of Magic]], leading to the [[Hot Spring Town]] in [[Former Hell]]. [[Yamame Kurodani]] is known to lurk around here, and according to her, it's the fifth-largest route to the [[Underworld]]. Not much else is known about it.

===Games===
;''Touhou Gouyoku Ibun''
The Rainbow Cavern first appeared in ''[[Touhou Gouyoku Ibun]]'', where it serves as the location of [[Reimu Hakurei]] and [[Marisa Kirisame]]'s second [[Stage]] as they proceed underground. Reimu has a surprising encounter with [[Kogasa Tatara]], who seems to know some information regarding the game's [[Incident|incident]], while Marisa encounters Yamame Kurodani, who's simply hunting for prey. Pre-release material also shows [[Kanako Yasaka]] encountering Yamame in this location.

The {{Nihongo|'''Rainbow Dragon Cave'''|虹龍洞|Kouryuudou}} is a cavern located on [[Youkai Mountain]]. The cave also acts as a mining shaft. 

==General Information==
The entrance to the cavern is located on the [[False Heaven Shelf]], guarded by [[Sannyo Komakusa]]. The cave gets its name because it contains an abundance of "Dragon Gems", a type of magical ore handed down that acts as a main ingredient for magatama. The cave has a labyrinthine structure, with its full layout still unknown. &lt;ref&gt;[[Unconnected Marketeers]] - [[Misumaru Tamatsukuri]]'s profile&lt;/ref&gt;

The cave is also an oxygen-deficient environment, which makes traversing the cave dangerous for unprepared humans.

==Appearances==
;Unconnected Marketeers
The protagonist encounters Misumaru deep in the mine, where she warns that there is no oxygen further in the cave and that the protagonist should turn around or she will die. When the protagonist ignores this warning, Misumaru fights her. The protagonist wins the spell card battle, but is exhausted by it and finally notices the effects of the low oxygen. Misumaru sells the protagonist a card and advises her to leave the mine and seek the true culprit at the top of the mountain, which she does.

Later in the Extra Stage, the player enters the Rainbow Dragon Cave after acquiring a special Ability Card that allows humans to breath in anoxic environments. After defeating Tsukasa, the heroine gets spotted by Momoyo, with the latter attacking the player after Tsukasa convinces her that Misumaru and the heroine are the thieves mentioned earlier. After getting defeated, Momoyo comments she was pleased to fight someone so strong, and invites the player to a rematch in the future.

{{nihongo|'''Reimaden'''|霊魔殿|reimaden}} is supposedly where stages 4 and 5 of ''[[Story of Eastern Wonderland]]'' take place. The place seems to be inhabited by various creatures such as [[crow]]s, [[windmill]]s and [[twister]]s. Here, [[Reimu Hakurei]] must face [[Matenshi]], [[Marisa Kirisame]] and [[Mima]]. It's unknown whether it's part of the [[World of Fantasies]] or part of [[Makai]] because [[Genjii]] stated that the World of Fantasies is between "[[Gensokyo|their world]]" and Makai. It's also unknown if Mima still lurks around this place.

"Reimaden" is possibly a pun on "Banmaden", meaning Pandemonium. [[Utsuho Reiuji]]'s orb resembles the orange-like shine in the background of stage 4.

The {{nihongo|'''Remains of Blazing Hell'''|灼熱地獄跡|Shakunetsu Jigoku Ato}}, also known as the {{nihongo|'''Hell of Blazing Fires'''|灼熱地獄|Shakunetsu Jigoku}} and {{nihongo|'''Remains of Hell'''|地獄跡地|Jigoku Atochi|lit. "Abandoned Site of Hell"}}, is thought to be in the deepest part of the [[Underworld]], located below [[Former Hell]] and the [[Palace of the Earth Spirits]].

==General Information==
The Remains of Blazing Hell was formerly a part of [[Former Hell]] where criminals were banished, it has recently been re-ignited because of the activation of the [[Nuclear Furnace]] directly below by [[Utsuho Reiuji]]. [[Rin Kaenbyou]] can be found here, carting corpses into the Furnace to keep it running. The place is very hot because it has a lot of magma, and it is invested with [[vengeful spirit]]s. Since people stopped being condemned to the hellfires, the [[oni]] don't visit any more either, so this place has become the playground to such spirits and animals. It's said that if you die here, your corpse will be trapped here and you'll turn into a vengeful spirit, where you cannot make it to [[Heaven]] regardless of your innocence.

Before the events of ''[[Subterranean Animism]]'', the Blazing Fires were apparently not as hot as it is now, because when [[Hell]] moved to a new location that in itself created [[Former Hell]], the Blazing Fires started to cool down, thus becoming dark, and [[Satori Komeiji]] sealed it off with the [[Palace of the Earth Spirits]].&lt;ref name="SAExPrologue"&gt;[[Subterranean Animism]]: [[Subterranean Animism/Story/Extra Story|Extra story]]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, this became space for [[Kanako Yasaka]] and [[Suwako Moriya]] to start a Mountain Industrial Revolution project, and Utsuho burned it up again after she swallowed the [[god]] [[Yatagarasu]].

==Blazing Fires' Appearances==
===Games===
;''Subterranean Animism''
The Remains of Blazing Hell was the source to the events of ''[[Subterranean Animism]]'', causing the geysers and the [[vengeful spirit]]s to roam above ground. It was the setting [[Stage]] 5 and first half of the Final Stage. After [[Reimu Hakurei]] or [[Marisa Kirisame]] defeated [[Satori Komeiji]] at the [[Palace of the Earth Spirits]] on Stage 2, they'll travel through The Blazing Fires, where they'll be attacked by a lot of [[vengeful spirit]]s. They'll once again face [[Rin Kaenbyou]] in her [[cat]] here as a midboss, and after some roaming, Rin will re-appear and convert into [[human]] form. She will attempt to try and catch your the heroine's corpse with her [[Zombie Fairy|zombie fairies]], but fails. After she was defeated, she'll point the heroine towards the deepest part of the Blazing Fires. On Stage 6, the heroine will be flying over magma literally, where they'll be attacked by [[raven]]s and more vengeful spirits, and Rin will attack once more. The heroine will then fly upwards into the [[Nuclear Furnace]] and meet the Final Boss, [[Utsuho Reiuji]].

===Spin-offs===
;''Double Spoiler''
The Blazing Fires appears in ''[[Double Spoiler]]'' on [[stage]] 8, where [[Aya Shameimaru]] and [[Hatate Himekaidou]] encounters [[Rin Kaenbyou]] and [[Utsuho Reiuji]] to try and take photos of their [[danmaku]]. Rin will appear in her [[cat]] form on scenes 1 and 7, and she'll also introduce [[Zombie Fairy|zombie fairies]] on scenes 3 and 8. The previous stage is in [[Makai]], whilst the next stage is at [[Palace of the Earth Spirits]]. There are 8 scenes total on this stage.

==Additional Information==
*In the music comments of ''[[Subterranean Animism]]'', [[ZUN]] refers to [[Reimu Hakurei]] flying over "lava", however the correct term for molten rock underground would be "magma".

The {{nihongo|'''Road of Liminality'''|中有の道|Chūu no Michi}} is a road in the back of the [[Youkai Mountain]] that leads to the [[Sanzu River]]. Though mainly traversed by [[ghost]]s and [[phantom]]s, the living can also walk down this road.

==General Information==
The threat level here is "low". Even it is full of [[phantom]]s and [[ghost]]s, the place is very active due to its stands. As [[Hell]] was beginning to become difficult to sustain on solely the fees levied on departed souls crossing the Sanzu River, numerous merchant's stands were set up as attractions. Because of this, the road is as lively as a shrine festival, and offers things such as "soul candy" and chances to catch dead goldfish. The stands, however, are run by criminals that were already sentenced to Hell, so often times people passing through will fall for their dirty tricks. If the merchants get caught conning customers, they are sent back to Hell.

Apparently, the festivities sometimes cause the spirit of a dead person to remember the happy times of their life, and retrace their steps to return to life. Even people who life festivals will come here.

The {{nihongo|'''Road of Lingering Snow'''|残雪の道|Zansetsu no Michi}} is a road that's covered in snow, just as spring was starting in the season 124 (year 2009). Not much is known about this road or its location. However, it seems that, based on the name of the road, snow can last for a long time here, as shown n ''[[Double Spoiler]]'' when the game is set in autumn of the same year.

==The Road's Appearances==
===Games===
;''Undefined Fantastic Object''
The road first appeared on [[Stage]] 1 in ''[[Undefined Fantastic Object]]''. The heroines will start flying over this road in order to chase the [[Palanquin Ship]], where its shadow can be seen on the road. They'll be collecting [[Seed of Unknown Form]]s without knowing. [[Nazrin]], being the midboss and [[boss]] of the stage, roamed down here because she thought she found something, but it turned out to be [[human]]. Either way, they'll dual, and instead of Nazrin being defeated, she'll flee. The road appears as a cameo on stage 2, 3 and the Extra Stage, when the heroine is flying through the sky.

===Spin-offs===
;''Double Spoiler''
The road appears in ''[[Double Spoiler]]'' on the Extra [[Stage]], where [[Aya Shameimaru]] and [[Hatate Himekaidou]] encounters [[Reimu Hakurei]], [[Marisa Kirisame]] and [[Sanae Kochiya]] to try and take photos of their [[danmaku]]. It is not explained why these three were lurking around this area. The previous stage is in [[Hokkai]] within [[Makai]], whilst the next stage is at the [[Waterfall of Nine Heavens]] in the [[Youkai Mountain]] on the Spoiler Stage. There are 9 scenes total on this stage, with three scenes per character.

The {{Nihongo|'''Road of Reconsideration'''|再思の道|Saishi no michi}} is a road where the [[Wikipedia:Lycoris radiata|red spider lilies]] blooms (especially in the autumn season, dyeing the road a deep red), connecting the [[Forest of Magic]] and [[Muenzuka]]. Avoided by the humans of [[Gensokyo]] due to its distant location, the [[Great Hakurei Barrier]] is somewhat blurred here.

==General Information==
The threat level is 'high' and [[phantom]]s and [[ghost]] are easily encountered, as well as an [[Human#Outsider|outsider]] is also likely. Many [[human]]s of [[Gensokyo]] never approach here, for the reason that opening to the Outside World could happen at any time; same goes for the [[Netherworld]], as this is a place where several barriers overlap and intersect. Those without relatives and those who try to commit suicide in the [[Outside World]] will often end up drifting across this road, ending up at [[Muenzuka]]. As those who've tried to commit suicide walk along this path when it is covered with red spider lilies, the toxins will swirl around their bodies, and then something wondrous yet unpleasant takes place: their will to survive will become rejuvenated. And then, deciding to try once more, they will suddenly come to reconsider their decisions and turn back with a renewed will to live. This is why this road has been called the "Road of Reconsideration".

There are nasty [[youkai]] who lie in wait, hoping to hunt for a meal of an outsider. After going through the trouble of enduring the struggles of reconsideration, and just when thinking about once again trying their best, being preyed upon by a youkai is no suitable repayment or reward. Depressed people, spiteful people bearing grudges, criminals and the like are the favorite food of youkai. There are plenty of those kinds of people here.

==The Road's Appearance==
;''Phantasmagoria of Flower View''
The hill appeared as a stage location in ''[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]'', in which it's the location for [[Komachi Onozuka]]. The stage generally appears on stage 8 in some scenarios of the game. Various characters will come here only to find out that there were also spirits lurking around, only for there to be a large amount of them due to Komachi slacking off. They defeat her, and after meet [[Eiki Shiki, Yamaxanadu]] at [[Muenzuka]]. Other characters will not come here and instead head for Muenzuka.

}}The '''Ruined Western Mansion''' ({{lang|ja|廃洋館}}, Haiyoukan) is a mansion where the echoes of ensemble rehearsals can be heard, yet none can be seen. It is home to three poltergeists, the [[Prismriver Sisters]].

It was formerly the mansion of Count Prismriver and his four daughters, human aristocrats of the outer world. But, after the family was torn apart by a series of unfortunate events, the mansion was abandoned by all but [[Layla Prismriver]], who refused to leave her beloved home. After Layla conjured poltergeists resembling her three sisters, they and the entire mansion disappeared into [[Gensokyo]] by the invocation of an unknown ritual.&lt;ref name="profile"&gt;''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]'' - Prismriver Sisters profile&lt;/ref&gt; The mansion is now located in the vicinity of the [[Misty Lake]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]] - Lunasa Primsriver's article&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the ghostly echoes may be disturbing to the mentally unprepared, any visitor can attempt to enlist the Prismriver Sisters for a musical performance. They are often seen around [[Gensokyo]] and the [[Netherworld]] at various events to generate publicity.&lt;ref name="profile"/&gt;

The {{nihongo|'''Sanzu River'''|三途の河|Sanzu no Kawa|literally "River of Three Paths", also in [[Wikipedia:British English|British English]] translation '''River Sanzu'''}} is the mist-shrouded river that dead souls must cross in order to reach [[Higan]], where they will await judgment. Part of the riverbank is accessible from [[Gensokyo]], even though the river's source, mouth and opposite bank lie outside it. Only the dead can cross the river on a [[shinigami]]'s boat if they can afford to pay; everything except shinigami and their boats will sink. The river is populated by the [[Phantom|phantoms]] of extinct marine life, including those from prehistoric times.

[[Komachi Onozuka]] may be seen ferrying souls here when she isn't slacking off. In Japanese Buddhist tradition, the Sanzu is said to have three crossings which vary in perilousness depending on the amount of sin a soul committed during his or her lifetime (hence the name). However, this concept is not used in Touhou: instead, Komachi uses her power of distance manipulation to vary the width of the river according to the souls' sinfulness.

==Sub-Locations==
===Sai no Kawara===
{{nihongo|'''Sai no Kawara'''|賽の河原||"riverbank of [[wikipedia:Dōsojin|''sai no kami'']]", sometimes colloquially termed "Children's Limbo" in English}} is a stretch of stone-covered riverbank where the souls of deceased newborns reside. In Japanese folklore, the children's spirits stack stone towers as a memorial for their parents. They are routinely forced to start over when small [[oni]] knock the towers over, but are eventually saved by [[wikipedia:Kṣitigarbha|Jizo Bosatsu]], who chases the oni away.

The {{nihongo|'''Scarlet Devil Mansion'''|紅魔館|Koumakan}}, also referred to as the ''Scarlet Manor'' or ''Scarlet Mansion'', is a European-style mansion owned by [[Remilia Scarlet]]. It is located on a ridge on the edge of the [[Misty Lake]]. From the outside, there are scarlet-colored windows, but there aren't many windows because of the nature of its [[vampire]] residents. There are plenty of rooms without windows at all, too. Through the dialogue of [[Touhou Hisoutensoku]] and multiple literary works, it can be said that the entrance to the mansion is usually not fully closed. There is a clock tower on the roof, but the bell on it only rings at night. The inside of the mansion is much larger than is apparent from the outside. This is due to [[Sakuya Izayoi]]'s ability to manipulate time and space.

==General Information==
The mansion's owner is [[Remilia Scarlet]]. [[Patchouli Knowledge]], a friend of hers, resides in the library, while Remilia's sister, [[Flandre Scarlet]], is not allowed to leave the mansion. [[Hong Meiling]] acts as the gatekeeper, but is frequently overpowered by many characters. Some time after the events of ''[[Ten Desires]]'', a number of [[hobgoblin]]s were hired on as additional help.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'' chapter 14&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[Fairy|fairies]] are employed by [[Remilia Scarlet]] as [[Fairy Maid]]s in order to clean the mansion, and they're overseen by the head maid, [[Sakuya Izayoi]]. The maids don't appear to be very useful, however, since they are just fairies. According to an advertisement in ''[[Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red]]'' ([[Cirno]]'s [[Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red/Cirno|interview]]), maids are provided with three meals a day and uniforms, but no paid vacations, breaks, or afternoon naps. However, unofficially (in terms of the mansion's policies), the fairy maids are free to do as they please&lt;ref name="PMiSSSakuya"&gt;[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]: [[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Sakuya Izayoi|Sakuya Izayoi]]&lt;/ref&gt;, and another employee gatekeeper Meiling is known to take afternoon "siestas" (which is either close enough to a nap, or an excuse to cover up that it is an actual nap). The advert shows the mansion is open to hiring other beings as maids, and Sakuya has indicated in the vampire team ending in ''[[Imperishable Night]]'' that if she were to train a successor, it would be human, but currently Sakuya is the only human maid at the mansion.&lt;ref name="PMiSSSakuya" /&gt; The maids are free to leave and return to regain their posts, but despite the fickle nature of the mistress, their lives are comfortable and most end up staying.&lt;ref name="PMiSSSakuya" /&gt;

The magic library in the mansion's basement is said to be the largest in [[Gensokyo]], but as it is not open to the general public, it's relatively unknown what kinds of books are in there.&lt;ref&gt;[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]: [[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Scarlet Devil Mansion|Scarlet Devil Mansion]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hieda no Akyuu]] suggests that there are very rare magic books, and there are also many books from the [[Outside World]]. Certainly, unconfirmed to Akyuu, at least some books are in [[Wikipedia:Esperanto|Esperanto]], some were written by Patchouli, and some are dangerous to even touch.&lt;ref&gt;[[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]]: Marisa A ending — Marisa has trouble reading a book because it is in Esperanto.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Immaterial and Missing Power]]: Patchouli ending — "''Within this library, there were naturally more than a few books written by Patchouli herself.''"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Immaterial and Missing Power]] Sakuya's ending - "''Just touching the books around here is dangerous. Don't get too close.''"&lt;/ref&gt; Remilia created a swimming pool in the library after the events of ''[[Silent Sinner in Blue]]'', but this is not intended to be a permanent fixture.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cage in Lunatic Runagate]]: [[Cage in Lunatic Runagate/Last Chapter|Last Chapter]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Koakuma]] resides here and serves Patchouli. It is unknown if she's the only little devil at the mansion, or if there are others.

Events are quite commonly held at the mansion, but as there is usually no previous notice of them, the residents are the only ones that attend. Various events are depicted in ''[[Strange and Bright Nature Deity]]'', and it seems that [[Marisa Kirisame]] is a frequent visitor. One exception was when the mansion held a publicity event during ''[[Silent Sinner in Blue]]'' to promote Remilia's plan to fly to the [[Moon]] in the [[Moon Rocket]], inviting pretty much everyone from the main cast of [[characters]]. The incident in ''[[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]]'' in 2003 made the mansion well-known to [[human]]s,&lt;ref name="PMiSSRemilia"&gt;[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]: [[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Remilia Scarlet|Remilia Scarlet]]"&lt;/ref&gt; and because of this, many characters throughout the ''[[Touhou Project]]'' will visit here.

===History===
It is unknown when, how, or why the mansion was originally constructed, but [[Remilia Scarlet]] has been its mistress for about 500 years, and [[Flandre Scarlet]] has been in the basement for about 495 years.&lt;ref name="EoSDRSProfile"&gt;[[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]]: Remilia's Profile&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]]: [[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil/Translation/Reimu's Extra|Reimu's Extra Stage Dialogue]]&lt;/ref&gt; The library in the basement was originally constructed for [[Patchouli Knowledge]]'s private use at an unknown time, not more than one hundred years ago but certainly still a considerable amount.&lt;ref&gt;[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]: [[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody/Translation/Alice's Scenario|Alice's scenario]] if Alice loses to Sakuya&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PMiSSPatchy"&gt;[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]: [[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Patchouli Knowledge|Patchouli Knowledge]]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is called the {{nihongo|"Scarlet Devil Mansion"|紅魔館}} because Remilia was called the "Scarlet Devil" before she came to [[Gensokyo]]. It is unknown what the mansion was called before Remilia came to be its mistress, or if the mansion even existed before then.&lt;ref name="BAiJRSDM"&gt;[[Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red]]: [[Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red/Scarlet Devil Mansion|Scarlet Devil Mansion]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Scarlet Devil Mansion apparently hasn't existed in [[Gensokyo]] for too long due to having originally been located in the [[Outside World]]. [[Aya Shameimaru]] implies that some kind of event probably occurred which brought it to Gensokyo. Given the power of its mistress, it may have come to Gensokyo by fate, as several descriptions of the mansion include a comment that the mansion feels like it was meant to belong there.&lt;ref name="PCBSakuyaProfile"&gt;[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]: Sakuya's profile&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="INPrologue"&gt;[[Imperishable Night]]: [[Imperishable Night/Translation/Prologue|Prologue]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SDVNovel"&gt;[[Seasonal Dream Vision/A Beautiful Flower Blooming Violet Every Sixty Years|A Beautiful Flower Blooming Violet Every Sixty Years]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CoSDStory"&gt;[[Changeability of Strange Dream]]: [[Changeability of Strange Dream/Story|Story]]&lt;/ref&gt; It seems safe to assume it entered Gensokyo along with its mistress, but this is not confirmed. The mansion was in Gensokyo at least as early as 1998 as some [[youkai]], such as [[Aya Shameimaru]], knew of the mansion before ''[[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]]''.&lt;ref name="BAiJRLunasa"&gt;[[Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red]]: [[Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red/Lunasa|Lunasa Prismriver]]&lt;/ref&gt;. Whether or not its mistress was the vampire that went on a rampage in the Vampire Incident, the mansion itself only become famous to humans in Gensokyo after the events of ''Embodiment of Scarlet Devil'' in 2003, although at least some youkai likely knew of its existence before then.

The mansion was the center of the main events of ''[[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]]'', taking place on [[Stage]] 3 all the way through to the Extra stage. [[Remilia Scarlet]] covered [[Gensokyo]] with a scarlet mist in order to make it darker so she can roam outdoors during daytime. The heroine will travel through the mansion to find Remilia and put the stop to the incident, whilst fighting [[Fairy Maid]]s, [[book]]s, [[spinning enemies]] and the main residents. After the heroine went across the [[Misty Lake]] on Stage 2, they'll first travel through the gate on Stage 3, where they'll encounter [[Hong Meiling]] who's guarding the gate, only to be defeated. They'll then go down to the library on Stage 4, encountering the midboss [[Koakuma]], then the [[boss]] [[Patchouli Knowledge]] who are also preventing them from ending the incident, only to also be defeated. When they get onto Stage 5, they travel down a hallway that's covered with knife-type [[danmaku]]. [[Sakuya Izayoi]] will appear to again prevent the heroine from getting to Remilia, but is defeated. Finally on the Final Stage, they'll fly up towards the rooftop. Sakuya will appear once more as the midboss, making the player "lose a [[bomb]]". Finally under a red [[Moon]], Remilia will show up, the Final Boss. After a long battle, the incident will be solved.

On the Extra stage, Patchouli made it rain over the mansion to prevent [[Flandre Scarlet]] from leaving. The heorines will once again travel through here to see what's up. They'll fly down another hallway, fighting more Fairy Maids with bizarre danmaku. Patchouli will re-appear as the midboss and is much more stronger. After defeating her and more fairies, Flandre herself will appear, not locked up in her basement, but roaming free around the hallways. She wants to play with the heroine, and after using up 10 [[spell card]]s, she was finally defeated.

;''Subterranean Animism''
Although it's indirect, [[Patchouli Knowledge]] sits in the library during ''[[Subterranean Animism]]'', where she communicates with [[Marisa Kirisame]] whilst she goes down to the [[Underworld]] throughout the game. However, the mansion appears on Ending No. 5 of the game.

===Spin-offs===
;''Shoot the Bullet''
The mansion frequently appears on ''[[Shoot the Bullet]]'', specifically on [[stage]]s 5, 7 and Ex-1 &amp; 2. On Stage 5, [[Aya Shameimaru]] encounters [[Hong Meiling]] and [[Patchouli Knowledge]] to try and take photos of their [[danmaku]].  The previous stage was at the [[Hill of the Nameless]], whilst the next stage is at the [[Netherworld]]. After the Netherworld on Stage 7, Aya will come back here and encounter [[Sakuya Izayoi]] and [[Remilia Scarlet]] to try and take photos of their [[danmaku]]. The location in question appears to be above the mansion, having a red [[Moon]] in the sky, and after here Aya will go back to the Netherworld to [[Hakugyokurou]] on stage 8. There are 8 scenes on both stage 5 and 7. Additionally on the Extra stage, Aya will come back to the mansion to encounter [[Flandre Scarlet]], trying to take photos of her [[danmaku]]. Aya will then fight [[Yukari Yakumo]] on Ex-3 and 4 at the [[Netherworld]].

;''Impossible Spell Card''
The mansion appears on the last (or the tenth) day of ''[[Impossible Spell Card]]'', where [[Seija Kijin]] finds herself here and carries on defending herself from stronger [[human]]s and [[youkai]] who are trying to capture her. Although it is not directly confirmed that the location of the last day is at the mansion, the images in the data files used to create the background are essentially the same from those of ''[[Shoot the Bullet]]''. Seija will fight against strong opponents such as [[Byakuren Hijiri]], [[Toyosatomimi no Miko]], [[Tenshi Hinanawi]], [[Remilia Scarlet]] and [[Yukari Yakumo]] as they try to capture her with their "impossible" [[spell card]]s. There are 10 scenes total in the day, having two scenes per character. The previous day was located at the [[Moriya Shrine]], and after the final day, Seija should've complete the whole game.

===Literature===
;''Strange and Bright Nature Deity''
The mansion is a prominent location in some chapters of ''[[Strange and Bright Nature Deity]]''.

==Additional Information==
*Unofficially, [[Patchouli Knowledge]]'s library was often called "Voile" based on its [[Voile, the Magic Library|stage theme]]. However, due to an official list of errata published for ''[[Eastern and Little Nature Deity]]'' correcting the name of Patchouli's library from {{nihongo|"Voile Library"|ヴワル図書館}} to {{nihongo|"the library inside the Scarlet Devil Mansion"|紅魔館内の図書館}},&lt;ref&gt;Ichijinsha Webpage - [https://web.archive.org/web/20100418180534/http://www.comptiq.com/release/comic/55touhou_owabi.html the list of errata] (''[[Eastern and Little Nature Deity]]'')&lt;/ref&gt; the name "Voile" is not considered canon.
*On the Final Day of ''[[Impossible Spell Card]]'', there's been reports that if the player chose to have the resolution of the game at 640×480 or 960×720, then the background will [[glitch]] to the right. Having it on 1280×960 will work fine, however.

The Sea of Tranquility appears as the setting for [[Stage]]s 5 and 6 of ''[[Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom]]'' and it seems to have its own atmosphere due to the life force of the fairies invading it.

}}{{seihou note}}
The '''Seihou World''' is the primary setting of the ''[[Seihou Project]]'' games. It's unclear of what the universe is, but it's suppose to be set in the far future where technology is advanced. 

==General Information==
===Geography and People===
The cosmos is known to have two planets, [[#Mars|Mars]] and [[#Earth|Earth]], as well as a Sun along with millions of stars seen thru [[#Outer Space|outer space]]. Meteoroids are known to orbit near Earth, with a [[#Military Base|Military Base]] also orbiting Earth.

According to ''[[Shuusou Gyoku]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s extra [[stage]], this world may not be based around [[Shinto]] compared to the ''[[Touhou Project]]'', but more to [[wikipedia:Christianity|Christianity]], since it's only known that [[Hirano Sakurasaki]] has a relation to Shinto in this world, and most characters have Western names. It's very futuristic, where there's spaceships, combat [[robot]]s, and endless space stations. Anyone can get from [[#Earth|Earth]] to [[#Mars|Mars]] is a matter of days{{Reference needed|Where is this stated?}}.

The universe mostly appears to only have [[human]]s and no "[[youkai]]" creatures, with rare exceptions such as [[Muse]] (and probably [[Icarus]] and [[Vivit (Erich's Daughter)|Vivit]]). It has been shown, like [[Gensokyo]], that it's possible for someone to turn into a [[phantom]]. Also, technology is so advance it's possible to turn a human into a [[cyborg]] if any damage was caused.

===History===
Little is known about the far past of the world of Seihou. Many decades ago on [[#Earth|Earth]], for some reason the environment was getting worse, and all its [[Plant|vegetation]] got extinct, except for the cactus. The Cactus Company, founded by [[Erich]], then tried to extract energy [[cactus energy|from the cacti]] for humanity to continue, but over time they were unable to stable the energy, causing a disastrous explosion.&lt;ref name="sh01prolog" /&gt; It turned Erich into a [[cyborg]] and got [[Vivit (Erich's Daughter)|Vivit]] (Erich's Daughter) trapped in a machine in what is called the "[[#Other Dimension|Other Dimension]]". While the company managed to control the energy, they created a [[maid]]-type [[robot]] called [[VIVIT]], who was based on Vivit.

Another time later, the same company discovered [[RedStorm]], and placed its energy plant on [[#Mars|Mars]]. However, a spaceship with [[Yuitia]] inside it went into fault and thus killed her, turning her into a [[phantom]]. She was then taken into and fused with RedStorm (which lost her true character) and went on a rampage as well as causing a rampage among all the machines that used RedStorm. 

==Canonicity on the Seihou World==
In terms to [[canon]] from the ''[[Seihou Project]]'', to look into where the Seihou World is as a location doesn't matter. However, due to having official connections with the ''[[Touhou Project]]'' in both Seihou &amp; Touhou canon, but also as having scanty information on where the Seihou World is in Touhou, the location of the Seihou World is questionable, debatable, ambiguous, and very complex. Also, the canonicity between the ''Touhou Project'' games [[PC-98]] and [[Windows]] are mostly unrelated and the stories are entirely separate, but references and carry-overs from the PC-98 to Windows have been shown. See the article '[[canon]]' for more information on PC-98 &amp; Windows. 

===Canonicity on Samidare===
''[[Samidare]]'' is part of ''[[Project Blank]]'' and was created by [[RebRank]]. The setting of ''Samidare'' is in another dimension compared to the Seihou World and [[Gensokyo]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Samidare/Translation/設定の仕事/no04-m05report.txt|Samidare: no04-m05report.txt]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[VIVIT]] was looking for the [[Holy Grail]] on the Extra Stage for her master, [[Erich]]. She said she has to find it "today". She was also looking for it on ''[[Shuusou Gyoku]]'''s Extra Stage, also stating "today".&lt;ref name="sh01extra"&gt;[[Shuusou Gyoku/Story/Extra Scenario|Shuusou Gyoku: Extra Scenario]]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The appearances for [[Yuki]] &amp; [[Mai]] (Along with the [[Bakebake]]) in this game didn't had [[ZUN]]'s involvement and thus making their appearance unofficial and may just have been a reference. Also, the theme during their appearance shows a [[wikipedia:Shinto|Shinto]] feeling.

===Conspiracy Theories as an Alternative Dimension to the [[Outside World]]===
The Seihou World is certainly not in [[Gensokyo]]. [[Yuuka Kazami|Yuuka]]'s been referred to as "foreign" by [[Milia]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Kioh Gyoku/Translation/Scenario|Kioh Gyoku: Scenario]]&lt;/ref&gt;, and [[VIVIT]] got completely lost during the Extra Stage of ''[[Shuusou Gyoku]]'' and ended up in Gensokyo without knowing since she was worried about getting back home.&lt;ref name="sh01extra"&gt;[[Shuusou Gyoku/Story/Extra Scenario|Shuusou Gyoku: Extra Scenario]]&lt;/ref&gt; It's unknown of how and why Yuuka ended up in the Seihou World in ''[[Kioh Gyoku]]''. Gensokyo is known to be set in the modern era while the Seihou World is set in the future, so for [[Marisa Kirisame|Marisa]] and [[Reimu Hakurei|Reimu]] to live for a very long time is highly unlikely.

----
:'''''Note:''' The following states the Seihou World to have a possibility of been a different dimension from the [[Outside World|outside world]], where it uses non-canon information (i.e. the [[Touhou Project]], classifying both [[PC-98]] &amp; [[Windows]] to be related), and therefore the information on the following is questionable and '''could''' be wrong.''

The Seihou World may not be in the [[Outside World|outside world]]. This stems from the fact that Reimu, Marisa, and Yuuka appear in the ''[[Seihou Project]]'', with various characteristics been very similar and having [[ZUN]]'s involvement in the series.

On ''[[Shuusou Gyoku]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Extra Stage, Marisa says "Here's some magic I haven't tried in a while,"&lt;ref name="sh01extra"&gt;[[Shuusou Gyoku/Story/Extra Scenario|Shuusou Gyoku: Extra Scenario]]&lt;/ref&gt; which the game was release two years after ''[[Mystic Square]]'', and both Reimu and Marisa looks similar to their ''[[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s outfit's. As well in [[Gensokyo Timeline|Gensokyo's timeline]], it's said that ''Mystic Square'' was in set in 2003 while ''[[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]]'' was officially on 2003/08/12, with ''Mystic Square'' not having [[spell card]]s, where as ''Embodiment of Scarlet Devil'' did. Reimu and Marisa wasn't seen using spell cards in ''Shuusou Gyoku'', so to say that the system was created after the event of ''Shuusou Gyoku''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Extra would make sense, creating a small gap in 2003 for the Extra to occur.

There've been a number of remarks, such as in ''Shuusou Gyoku'' on the comment for the theme "Silk Road Alice" where [[ZUN]] quoted "Our [[VIVIT|maid heroine]] must also travel the silk roa- ([[wiktionary:abridged|abridged]])."&lt;ref name="silkroad"&gt;[[Shuusou Gyoku/Music|Shuusou Gyoku: Music]]&lt;/ref&gt; It's known that [[VIVIT]] must've travelled the Silk Road, and in the Extra Stage, she ended up at the [[Hakurei Shrine]]. Another example is the comment for "{{H:title|Dichromatic Lotus Butterfly ~ Red and White|Arrangement of Reimu's theme 'Dichromatic Lotus Butterfly ~ Ancients' from Shuusou Gyoku}}" in ''[[Dolls in Pseudo Paradise]]''. Reimu quotes "It looks like some strange person has slipped through again. I'd better do something before she gets to the shrine... Oh, that girl... doesn't look like a human nor a youkai,"&lt;ref&gt;[[Dolls in Pseudo Paradise/Story|Dolls in Pseudo Paradise: Story]]&lt;/ref&gt; where she might be referring to VIVIT who got lost in the Extra of ''Shuusou Gyoku'', who is neither a human nor a youkai, and is a [[robot]]. VIVIT's the only source to point to who "slipped through" (most likely referring to the [[Great Hakurei Barrier]]) and isn't a human or youkai.

In ''Kioh Gyoku'', Yuuka was given a profile that there's "well, some relation." It was stated that she managed to obtain "ultimate magic" in the profile, where after ''[[Mystic Square]]'''s Extra Stage ending she received "ultimate magic". Also, due to the theme that the game has with attacks similar to ''[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]'' that used spell cards, it's unknown if Yuuka started using spell cards at the time of ''Kioh Gyoku''.

[[#Earth|Earth]] lost all its [[Plant|vegetation]] (except for the cactus and exceptions of grass and trees), but it appeared that on the Extra that there were numerous amount of plants and flowers in the background on the [[#Silk Road|Silk Road]] and at the [[Hakurei Shrine]]. Reimu and Marisa also appeared to had no involvement in what has happened to the world of Seihou when it lost all its vegetation and that riots happened across the planet. 

It's impossible for anyone (apart from [[Yukari Yakumo]]) from Gensokyo to enter the outside world. There's been occasions however where certain beings have passed through the [[Great Hakurei Barrier]]. As said, it's unknown how Yuuka entered the Seihou World, but from a speculative point of view, it can be only said that she may have travelled up the [[#Silk Road|Silk Road]], but this can be false as there's no prove. Unrelated in ''[[Samidare]]'', the comment on the third Extra Stage theme (i.e. "East of Eden", where [[Yuki]] and [[Mai]] appear) quotes "Outside rhythms flowing from a radio slipped in through a spiritual barrier."&lt;ref&gt;[[Samidare/Music|Samidare: Music]]&lt;/ref&gt;

If all this is true, then the Seihou World would be running at the same timeline to Gensokyo and the outside world. It could be another dimension that's a clone like the outside world, but just more futuristic and has a different date. 

----
:'''''Note:''' The following states the Seihou World '''to be''' the [[Outside World|outside world]] in the future. It doesn't use non-canon information (i.e. the [[Touhou Project]]).''

In ''[[Shuusou Gyoku]]'', the prologue at the start simply says "This tale is set on Earth, way in the future."&lt;ref name="sh01prolog"&gt;[[Shuusou Gyoku/Story/Prologue|Shuusou Gyoku: Prologue]]&lt;/ref&gt; The appearances of the Touhou cast within the ''[[Seihou Project]]'' is non-canon to the ''[[Touhou Project]]'' as they appear in the ''Seihou Project'' as "guests", even though they were added by [[ZUN]] himself, which to add that ZUN didn't create the ''Seihou Project''.

As stated on an above comment, Reimu and Marisa had no involvement in what has happened to the world of Seihou when it lost all its vegetation and that riots happened across the planet. On the other hand instead of having connexions with the world of Seihou, Reimu and Marisa have no canonicity for them to be aware of the Earths environment in Seihou.

:'''''Note:''' The following continues with the above said, but it uses non-canon information (i.e. the [[Touhou Project]]), so therefore the information is questionable and '''could''' be wrong.''

According to [[Hieda no Akyu]] in ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'', [[Marisa Kirisame]] might possibly become a [[youkai]] in the future due to been an over-powered [[human]] [[magician]], and youkai's can live for a very long time.&lt;ref&gt;[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Marisa Kirisame|Perfect Memento in Strict Sense: Marisa Kirisame's article]]&lt;/ref&gt; Since [[Yuuka Kazami]] is a youkai, she may live for a very long time anyway (this also goes to [[Yuki]] and [[Mai]]). There's no canon information about [[Reimu Hakurei]] and her future.

==Sub-Locations==
The Seihou World is composed of several landmarks, planets and other miscellany sectors. Here's a list of locations within the Seihou World.

===Earth===
:{{nihongo|'''Earth'''|地球|chikyuu}} is mostly the prime location of the ''[[Seihou Project]]''. It's a planet that has humanity living on it, but at some point decades ago it lost all its [[Plant|vegetation]] and thus all humanity have to rely on [[cactus energy]] after long research through cacti. The Cactus Company is held on this planet, founded by [[Erich]], who specialises in the energy.&lt;ref name="sh01prolog" /&gt; Earth still happens to have different themed landscapes though, such as grassy plains, metropolitan cities, deserts and seas.&lt;ref name="sh01manual"&gt;[[Shuusou Gyoku/Translation/Manual|Shuusou Gyoku: Manual]]&lt;/ref&gt;

:Even though Earth has lost its vegetation (exept for the cactus), layers of grass was still shown in ''[[Shuusou Gyoku]]'' and ''[[Kioh Gyoku]]'', but this was decades later after vegetation went extinct. In ''[[Banshiryuu]]'', even trees appeared in the [[#Forest of Great Regression|Forest of Great Regression]]. This could suggest Earth still had some form of vegetation and that it's slowly improving.

===Mars===
:{{nihongo|'''Mars'''|火星|Kasei}} is another planet next to Earth. Little is known about the planet, except that it holds the energy plant "Red Storm" that was founded by the Cactus Company. [[Yuitia]] is caught in an accident near the planet and eventually got fused with a machine in Red Storm, causing a rampage on Earth. It's the setting of the final stage of ''[[Banshiryuu]]''.

===Outer Space===
:{{nihongo|'''Outer Space'''|宇宙|Uchuu}} is just what the name calls it, but in relation to the ''[[Seihou Project]]'' there's little information about it. Humans are able to travel through the vacuum since many spaceships are seen attacking [[VIVIT]]. It's the setting of the fourth stage of ''[[Shuusou Gyoku]]'' where [[Marie]] attacks VIVIT. There appears to be a route called {{nihongo|"Mars Route T-14"|火星航路T-14|Kasei kōro T-14}}, which could suggest that it's a 'pathway' from Earth to Mars. If so, then it's the setting of the fifth stage of ''[[Banshiryuu]]'' where [[Lagunas]] attacks [[VIVIT]] and [[Hirano Sakurasaki]].

===Military Base===
:The {{nihongo|'''Military Base'''|基地|Kichi}} is a satellite base that presumably has some involvement with [[Erich]], the [[cactus energy]] and the entrance to the "[[#Other Dimension|Other Dimension]]". As [[VIVIT]] says "When did they make such thing upon a satellite orbit?" it suggest that it's in orbit with [[#Earth|Earth]].&lt;ref name="sh01"&gt;[[Shuusou Gyoku/Story/Main Scenario|Shuusou Gyoku: Main Scenario]]&lt;/ref&gt; It's the setting for the fifth stage of ''[[Shuusou Gyoku]]''. Strangely, numerous magic circle's appears on the base.

===Other Dimension===
:The {{nihongo|'''Other Dimension'''|異空間|I kūkan|or even referred to as '''unusual dimension'''}} is a cold, frightening and mysterious [[wikipedia:Dimension|dimension]].&lt;ref name="sh01" /&gt; It's the setting of Stage 6 of ''[[Shuusou Gyoku]]'', where [[Vivit (Erich's Daughter)|Vivit]] ([[Erich]]'s daughter) was mysteriously captured and trapped here after an incident with [[cactus energy]] decades ago. It appears to have a strange background that contains rain and illusionary clocks going down the screen.&lt;ref name="sh01" /&gt;

===Silk Road===
:In reality, the {{nihongo|'''Silk Road'''|シルクロード|Shirukurōdo}} refers to a network of interlinking trade routes, connecting the East to the West. It connects [[wikipedia:East Asia|East Asia]], [[wikipedia:South Asia|South Asia]], [[wikipedia:Java-Indonesia|Java-Indonesia]], the [[wikipedia:Arabian Peninsula|Arabian Peninsula]], [[wikipedia:Central Asia|Central Asia]], [[wikipedia:India|India]], [[wikipedia:North Africa|North Africa]], [[wikipedia:East Africa|East Africa]] and [[wikipedia:Europe|Europe]] all together with this road. It's furthest to the East is [[wikipedia:Japan|Japan]] and the furthest to the West is [[wikipedia:Italy|Italy]].

:In the ''[[Seihou Project]]'', the Silk Road was stated by [[ZUN]] where he said in the music comments of ''[[Shuusou Gyoku]]'' "Our [[VIVIT|maid heroine]] must also travel the silk roa- (abridged)."&lt;ref name="silkroad" /&gt; This could suggest that VIVIT must've travelled down the Silk Road to get to the [[Hakurei Shrine]]. It can also suggest that it's the setting of the first half of the Extra Stage of ''Shuusou Gyoku''. The Silk Road appears to have a numerous amount of plants and flowers in the background. This is odd because it's known that [[#Earth|Earth]] lost all its [[Plant|vegetation]] (except for the cactus and exceptions of grass and trees). The [[Hakurei Shrine]] also appears to have a numerous amount of plants and flowers in the background.

===Forest of Great Regression===
:The {{nihongo|'''Forest of Great Regression'''|大いなる逆進化の森|Ōinaru gyaku shinka no mori}} was a starting point for the heroine on the first stage of ''[[Banshiryuu]]''. Very little is known about the forest except that it also appeared as the fourth scene in the Extra when fighting [[Gates]]. While it's known [[#Earth|Earth]]'s vegetation has gone extinct (except for the cactus), the forest still appears to have a few trees.

===Hirano's Shrine===
:Hirano's shrine first appeared on the forth stage of ''[[Banshiryuu]]''. There isn't much known about this shrine except that it's owned by [[Hirano Sakurasaki]] and the [[god]] for this shrine is [[Gyoku]]. Its location is unknown since [[The Tri Stars]] sent [[VIVIT-r]] through a '[[wikipedia:Warp drive|warp device]]' to the shrine on the third stage. The music room's comments describe this shrine as being in a "mysterious foreign space". It's most likely on [[#Earth|Earth]] due to VIVIT-r going to [[#Outer Space|outer space]] on the fifth stage after defeating Hirano.

{{nihongo|'''Senkai'''|仙界||hermit world}} is a sealed secret world suited for [[hermit]]s, which even [[Gensokyo]] did not know of before the events of ''[[Ten Desires]]''. According to [[Toyosatomimi no Miko]] during the first part of a symposium between her, [[Kanako Yasaka]] and [[Byakuren Hijiri]], it's a space that Miko had created, herself. A location where nobody else can bother someone is well-suited for hermits.

==Geography and People==
Little is known about the geography of Senkai. It's accessed via the principle that any crack contains limitless space, which connects the world to any other location allowing it to be accessed from anywhere. For example, [[Toyosatomimi no Miko]] showed [[Reimu Hakurei]] a way to get to it by pointing to a crack in the ground. Reimu sarcastically replied by asking if Miko was an ant. The residence isn't off-limits to those seeking shelter from [[youkai]], but the hidden nature of the entrance(s) tends to make that option not particularly viable.&lt;ref&gt;[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]]: [[Symposium_of_Post-mysticism/Toyosatomimi_no_Miko|Toyosatomimi no Miko]]. "If you're ever pursued by youkai, she should provide refuge at her residence. However, the entrance is hidden and no-one knows where it is... (*3)" &lt;/ref&gt;

Both Reimu and Sanae's endings in ''[[Ten Desires]]'' which mention Senkai explicitly state that Miko and "her followers"/"the rest" moved to Senkai, and Miko refers to it as "our home" to Reimu. Miko and her followers built a dojo suited for hermits in Senkai after the events of ''[[Ten Desires]]'' to be their home. This building was described by [[Reimu Hakurei]] in the extra stage backstory as pretty big and shiny. It's not yet explicitly confirmed if Senkai is their actual [[canon]] action after ''Ten Desires'' however, but no other information contradicts it. ''[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]]'' has Miko describing her current residence as a special location outside of [[Gensokyo]] suitable for [[hermit]]s, which seems to match Senkai's description.

''[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]]'' states that Seiga isn't particularly close to Miko and Futo, but does not state if she shares their residence. In page 23 of ''[[Forbidden Scrollery]]'' Chapter 3, Reimu and Marisa are shown briefly visiting Seiga, Futo, and a third person who is likely Yoshika (from what little you can see of her) in a building, but it is not shown where this location is. There aren't even any pointer-indicators to show where it is on the "map" on the page, unlike the [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]] or the [[Human Village]].

===Divine Spirit Mausoleum===
As of ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'', Miko has constructed a Taoist temple within Senkai known as the {{nihongo|'''Divine Spirit Mausoleum'''|神霊廟}}. It welcomes humans aspiring to become hermits, but most of them fail the necessary training. It shares its name with the area in [[Ten_Desires/Story/Reimu%27s_Scenario#Stage_6|Stage 6 of Ten Desires]], but it is unknown if they are intended to be one and the same.

===Kasen Ibaraki's Mansion===
[[File:WaHHCh03Kasen'sMansion.png|thumb|150px|Kasen's home as seen in ''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'']]
[[Kasen Ibaraki]]'s home lies somewhere deep within the mountain close by the Moriya Shrine, hidden within her own climate-controlled version of [[Senkai]].&lt;ref name="WaHHCh37"&gt;''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'': Chapter 37&lt;/ref&gt; It is described in ''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'' as being a large mansion by Sanae, though Kasen herself refers to it as a [[wikipedia:Dojo|dojo]].&lt;ref name="WaHHCh2"&gt;''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'': Chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt; A scroll with the 8th stage towards enlightenment depicted in [[wikipedia:Ten Bulls|Ten Bulls]], namely "Both Bull and Self Transcended", can be seen hanging from her wall.

==Story==
===Windows===
;''Ten Desires''
In Reimu's ending and [[Sanae Kochiya]]'s alternate ending, because they were opposed to living in a place under a temple of [[youkai]], Miko and her followers relocated to and built a dojo in another world called "Senkai". Reimu and [[Sanae Kochiya]] were invited to it and visited it. In the extra stage backstory, [[Marisa Kirisame]] wonders how she can sneak into it.

===Spin-offs===
The Divine Spirit Mausoleum was a [[stage]] location in both ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'' and ''[[Urban Legend in Limbo]]'', associated with [[Toyosatomimi no Miko]].

===Literature===
;''[[Forbidden Scrollery]]''
Senkai is apparently visited by Reimu and Marisa at the end of ''[[Forbidden Scrollery]]'' Chapter 3 in pursuit of an [[Enenra]] youkai that was fleeing to various locations.

==Additional Information==
*[[Hieda no Akyuu]] lists [[Soga no Tojiko]]'s location as "unknown" in ''Symposium of Post-mysticism''.
*''Hopeless Masquerade'' does not explicitly refer to the location as "Senkai" in Futo's ending. However, its description of Miko and Futo's realm as "a space created by hermit arts, it's unclear if it's actually in Gensokyo." is extremely similar to the other descriptions of Senkai.

The {{nihongo|'''Shining Needle Castle'''|輝針城|Kishinjou}}&lt;ref&gt;Shining Needle Castle: Japanese title of the work, character text of Shinmyoumaru, Title of Stage 5 theme; Title of Stage 6&lt;/ref&gt; is a castle that's located in the sky near the base of [[Youkai Mountain]]&lt;ref&gt;''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'' Chapter 19&lt;/ref&gt;. It's also referred to as the {{nihongo|'''Inverted Castle'''|逆さ城|Sakasajou}}&lt;ref&gt;Inverted Castle: character texts of Benben and Yatsuhashi, dialogs of Benben, Yatsuhashi and Seija; Title of Stage 5&lt;/ref&gt;, though it's unknown whether this is a proper name for the castle or just an informal description of it. It is the home of [[Shinmyoumaru Sukuna]].

==Background Information==
According to Shinmyoumaru's profile&lt;ref&gt;[[Shinmyoumaru Sukuna#Official Profiles|Shinmyoumaru Sukuna Offical Profile]]&lt;/ref&gt;, the castle was created with the power of the [[Miracle Mallet]] by Issun-Boushi's descendants, and, as the power of the Mallet ran out due to it being overused, the castle got reversed.

There are some possible inspirations to the castle, which are:
*There is a stage {{nihongo|[http://castlevania.wikia.com/wiki/Castlevania:_Symphony_of_the_Night#The_Inverted_Castle "Inverted Castle"]|逆さ城|Sakasajou}} in ''[[Wikipedia:Castlevania: Symphony of the Night|Castlevania: Symphony of the Night]]''.
*Some people think that Inverted Castle is also inspired by {{nihongo|"Treasure Palace of Stone"|石の宝殿|Ishi no Houden}}, {{nihongo|"Rock House of Stability"|鎮の石室|Shizu no iwaya}} or commonly known as {{nihongo|Floating Stone|浮石|Ukiishi}}, which is located at Oushiko Shrine in Hyougo Prefecture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.pref.fukuoka.jp/hp/gallery/nippon/kg/n1-111k.html a sketch of the whole design] drawn by [[Wikipedia:Philipp Franz von Siebold|Philipp von Siebold]]&lt;/ref&gt;

It has some different legends. According to the official booklet of its history, Ookuninushi and Sukuna-hikona arrived there from their original land Izumo in order to found the lands, and worked together to construct the stone palace just one night. This facility was planned for the stability and peace of living and governing. In the middle of working, the rebellion of Aga gods occured, which forced the two to interrupt their action, to gather gods for their side, and to flatten the enemy. Next morning, the rebellion was pacified but the stone palace was unfinished; the two didn't leave it away cruelly, but enspirited it and promised that they keep the land stable.

On the other hand, there is another legend&lt;ref&gt;Tetsurou Watsuji "Jijoden no Kokoromi" &lt;i&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[Trial of Autobiography]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/i&gt; (1961) ch.2 "Watakushi no Umareta Ie" &lt;i&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[The home where I was born]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; as an oral legend: Some god came to the mind that everyone must be surprised to see the treasurous palace made of rock, then he commanded its construction to other gods. [[Amanojaku]] was one of them. His part was the disposal of stones cut off. He wanted to stop the work, then mimic the cock-a-doodle-doo of rooster. The gods working aroud him mistook it for the opening of the day. At last, they concluded that they weren't able to finish the construction, and went home to let it overturned.

Sukunahiko appeared in the former legend, who was one of the inspirations of [[Shinmyoumaru Sukuna]]. And Amanojaku appeared the latter, which is [[Seija Kijin]]'s species.

==Castle's Appearances==
[[File:Th14Shiningneedlecastle.jpg|thumb|200px|The castle in ''DDC'' and ''ISC'']]
===Games===
;''Double Dealing Character''
The castle first appeared on stage 5 and 6 of ''[[Double Dealing Character]]''. [[Seija Kijin]] tried to overthrow society with the help of [[Shinmyoumaru Sukuna]]'s [[Miracle Mallet]], but the two ended up defeated by [[Reimu Hakurei]], [[Marisa Kirisame]] and [[Sakuya Izayoi]].

===Spin-offs===
;''Impossible Spell Card''
The castle appears on the eighth day of ''[[Impossible Spell Card]]'', where [[Seija Kijin]] comes back here and carries on defending herself from other [[youkai]] who are trying to capture her. On Scene 1, it turned out that [[Shinmyoumaru Sukuna]] and Seija turned against each other, because Shinmyoumaru wanted to surrender to the residents of [[Gensokyo]] due to the events of ''[[Double Dealing Character]]'', but Seija refused. Thus, Shinmyoumaru and a lot of other people try and capture her. After, she'll also fight against [[Reimu Hakurei]] and once again [[Mamizou Futatsuiwa]] as they try to capture her with their "impossible" [[spell card]]s. There are 7 scenes total in the day. The previous day was located at the [[Netherworld]], whilst the next day is located at the [[Moriya Shrine]].

;''Urban Legend in Limbo''
The castle appeared as a [[stage]] location in ''[[Urban Legend in Limbo]]'', associated with [[Shinmyoumaru Sukuna]]

{{nihongo|'''Skies of Gensokyo'''|幻想郷上空|Gensōkyō Jōkū}}, also {{nihongo|'''Above the Clouds'''|雲の上|Kumo no Ue}}, is what it literally is; the skies that cover the atmosphere of [[Gensokyo]]. Although there isn't really much about the sky, it does set the location of various [[stage]]s in some ''[[Touhou Project]]'' games.

==General Information==
The sky could be considered a place for easy transport for the residents of [[Gensokyo]] who can fly. In order to reach the [[Netherworld]], one must find the [[Barrier of Life &amp; Death]] that's located up in the sky. The [[Palanquin Ship]] rode across the sky during ''[[Undefined Fantastic Object]]''. A storm once appeared twice during the events of ''[[Double Dealing Character]]'', and it appears that it's still there as of ''[[Impossible Spell Card]]'', although it is unknown why it was there. The first time it appeared was due to the [[Miracle Mallet]] cause by [[Shinmyoumaru Sukuna]], which erupted the storm. The second time was caused by [[Raiko Horikawa]], who learnt how to gain power from her original owner.

==Appearances==
===PC-98 Games===
;''Story of Eastern Wonderland''
In all the endings of ''[[Story of Eastern Wonderland]]'', [[Reimu Hakurei]] and [[Genji]] are flying through the skies to try and find [[Mima]] who escaped from the [[Hakurei Shrine]]. They also talk about the true meaning to using the [[Yin-Yang Orb]].

===Windows Games===
;''Perfect Cherry Blossom''
The Stage 4 of ''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]'' takes place above the clouds. The heroine flies over the sky to get to the [[Barrier of Life &amp; Death]] after being pointed the right direction by [[Alice Margatroid]]. As they're flying over the clouds, they'll fight various [[stage enemies]] such as [[Fairy|fairies]] and [[spinning enemies]]. The heroine will also be attacked by [[Lily White]] who is the stage's midboss. She wanted to announce spring, but with [[danmaku]]. At the end, they'll finally get to the barrier, who will fight against the [[Prismriver Sisters]] since they're the [[boss]] of the stage. After, they'll get to the [[Netherworld]].

;''Phantasmagoria of Flower View''
The [[Barrier of Life &amp; Death]] above the clouds appeared as a [[stage]] location in ''[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]'', in which the [[Prismriver Sisters]] are dedicated to this location, specifically [[Lunasa Prismriver]], [[Merlin Prismriver]] and [[Lyrica Prismriver]]. It is mostly dedicated to Lyrica because she is not with her sisters. The location is generally dedicated to stages 2, 3 or 4, but may appear as stage 1 on [[Medicine Melancholy]]'s scenario and it doesn't appear [[Komachi Onozuka]]'s scenario. Various characters will come here to look for leads towards the flower incident (even though flowers don't grow here), only to find and defeat Lyrica.

;''Undefined Fantastic Object''
During the events of ''[[Undefined Fantastic Object]]'', the [[Palanquin Ship]] appeared flying across the skies of Gensokyo, which made the heroine think it was a treasure ship, thus they set out to have a look at it. The setting of [[Stage]] 2 takes place over some clouds, which are called {{nihongo|"Spring Clouds"|春の雲|Haru no Kumo}} that are above the [[Road of Lingering Snow]]. This makes sense because the game is set at the start of spring of 2009. As the heroine flies over the spring clouds after coming from the Road of Lingering Snow, they'll be attacked by [[Fairy|fairies]], [[Sunflower Fairy|sunflower fairies]] and [[flying yin-yangs]]. [[Kogasa Tatara]] is the midboss and [[boss]] of the stage, who is easily defeated. On stage 3, the heroine will've caught up to the Palanquin Ship and go on board, only to be attacked by more fairies and flying yin-yangs. They'll encounter [[Ichirin Kumoi]] and [[Unzan]] who are guarding the Palanquin Ship. They get defeated, and thus the heroine will go into the ship.

The Extra Stage is once again located in the sky; the location is simply titled {{nihongo|"The Night Sky"|夜の空|Yoru no Sora}}. On the stage itself, the heroine will fly through the clouds and fight bizarre fairies and flying yin-yangs, shooting vigorous [[danmaku]]. Kogasa surprises the heroine as the midboss of the stage, using three [[spell card]]s, but was defeated. After more roaming through the clouds, the heroine will encounter a mysterious orb, which was revealed to be [[Nue Houjuu]]. She appeared as the Stage 4 and 6 midboss as an orb. She is the [[boss]] of the stage, and thus uses 10 spell cards before she is defeated. The appearance of this stage is that there are a lot of thick clouds in a foggy state with colorful, dim clouds, and sparkly, blue dots appear to emerge from the ground. This scenery appeared to have been caused by Nue, so it is unknown if this still exists after the stage.

;''Double Dealing Character''
[[File:Th14SkiesOfGensokyoStExBlue.jpg|thumb|160px|The blue storm in the Extra Stage of ''DDC'']]
In ''[[Double Dealing Character]]'', the heroine will travel to the Skies of Gensokyo on Stage 4 after coming from the [[Bamboo Forest of the Lost]]. The title of this stage is {{nihongo|"Skies of Gensokyo (Stormy)"|幻想郷上空（嵐）|Gensōkyō Jōkū (Arashi)}}. Here, the heroine will travel here wondering why there is an orange storm in the sky. They'll fight [[Fairy|fairies]] and [[flying yin-yangs]] as they'll roam across the place. If the player chooses Type A for any character, they'll encounter [[Yatsuhashi Tsukumo]] as the midboss and [[Benben Tsukumo]] as the [[boss]] of the stage, but if they chosen Type B, it's vice versa. They're [[tsukumogami]] who came to life thanks to this storm, where they'll fight the heroine because they're seen as an enemy. Once defeated, they give the indication of where the storm is coming from: the [[Shining Needle Castle]]. Stages 5 and 6 will take place in the inverted castle that floats in the sky, and once [[Shinmyoumaru Sukuna]] is defeated on the Final Stage, the [[Miracle Mallet]] will stop the storm.

However, the storm once again appears without the help from the Mallet, and thus is getting power from an unknown source, therefore the heroine will set out to have a look at this on the Extra Stage. The location title of this stage uses the same one from Stage 4. Here, the heroine will fly through here and fight bizarre fairies and flying yin-yangs, shooting vigorous [[danmaku]]. Yatsuhashi and Benben are the midboss of the stage who will fight as a duo. After they're defeated, the heroine will do more roaming and the storm will turn into a blue and purple coloured storm. Finally, [[Raiko Horikawa]] will appear as the boss, who wants to test her new, independent power on the heroine. After she's used 10 [[spell card]]s, she is finally defeated. It's not stated as to what happened to this storm, but it re-appears in ''[[Impossible Spell Card]]''.

===Spin-offs===
;''Double Spoiler''
Stage 10 of ''[[Double Spoiler]]'' takes place at the Spring Clouds, which still appear to be here since this game is set in autumn. Here, [[Aya Shameimaru]] and [[Hatate Himekaidou]] encounters [[Tenshi Hinanawi]] and [[Iku Nagae]] to try and take photos of their [[danmaku]]. There are 8 scenes total on this stage. The previous stage is at the [[Palace of the Earth Spirits]] in [[Former Hell]] of the [[Underworld]], whilst the next stage is at the [[Wind God's Lake]] on the [[Youkai Mountain]].

;''Impossible Spell Card''
The fifth day takes place at the skies of Gensokyo in ''[[Impossible Spell Card]]'' that is at the same storm from ''[[Double Dealing Character]]'', where [[Seija Kijin]] carries on defending herself from other [[youkai]] who are trying to capture her. She'll fight against [[Raiko Horikawa]], [[Yatsuhashi Tsukumo]] and [[Benben Tsukumo]] as they try to capture her with their "impossible" [[spell card]]s. There are 8 scenes total in the day. On Scene 1, Seija will have a conversation with Raiko, and they appear to have some disagreements. She also earns the new item "Substitute Jizo", which allows her to have multiple lives per try. The previous day was at the [[Myouren Temple Cemetery]], whilst the next day is located at the [[Untrodden Valley]] on the [[Youkai Mountain]].

The {{nihongo|'''Spring Path'''|春の小径|Haru no Komichi}} is a mysterious, long path full of flowers and cherry blossom.

==General Information==
There isn't much information about the path as a whole. It seems to be connected to the [[Misty Lake]] and the [[Forest of Magic]]. The ground is overwhelmed with flowers and it is plausible that it is covered with cherry blossoms.&lt;ref&gt;[[Fairy Wars]]: Stage Title — {{nihongo|Fairy Flowerpath|妖精の花道}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Fairy Wars]]: Stage Title — {{nihongo|Danmaku in a Spring of Fluttering Cherry Petals|桜舞い散る春の弾幕}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Fairy Wars]]: Stage Title — {{nihongo|Moonlight Under the Night Sakura|夜桜の下の月明り}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name may be derived from the falling cherry petals and blooming flowers which is an occurring event during spring. It is also possibly related to [[Reimu]]'s theme "Spring Lane ~ Colorful Path" from ''[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]''.

==Path's Appearances==
While it was spring, the events of ''[[Fairy Wars]]'' happened. It appeared there as various stages. At three of the five fights you will encounter [[Lily White|Lily Black]] as a midboss and the [[stage]]'s [[boss]] will always be one of the [[Three Fairies of Light]].

==Additional Information==
*In the data files of ''[[Fairy Wars]]'', the images used for each background of the Spring Path is, apart from different colouring, exactly the same as the background image used for the [[Mysterious Cherry Blossom Path]] of the same game.

{{nihongo||鈴奈庵|'''Suzunaan'''|roughly "bell hermitage"}} is a traditional Japanese style [[wikipedia:Kashi-hon|book renter]] located somewhere in the [[human village]]. Although it is a book lender, they also sell books, and even provide a small book printing service. The ''Gensokyo Chronicle'' (''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'') written by [[Hieda no Akyuu]] was also printed and bound here.

Most of the books they deal in are the books that drifted into [[Gensokyo]] from the outside world, which they call {{nihongo|"foreign books"|外来本|gairai bon}}. Kosuzu has been also secretly using some income of the store to gather a collection of rare [[demon book]]s, and rents out at high price.

The inspiration of this shop is [http://www.norinagakinenkan.com/collect/syosai30.html Suzunoya] {{nihongo|lit. "Floor of Bell"|鈴屋}}, the personal study room of [[Wikipedia:Motoori Norinaga|Norinaga Motoori]], who is the inspiration of Kosuzu. And you can find a mark of something like vegetable on the store curtains, name board of the shop, and even the font of title logo. Those are all turnips, which are called in a little old Japanese "&lt;b&gt;suzu&lt;/b&gt;na" ({{lang|ja|菘}}/{{lang|ja|鈴菜}}) — the latter literally means "bell vegetable" to resemble the shape of bell and turnip. This might be refered from [http://www.norinagakinenkan.com/norinaga/kaisetsu/onraizu.html {{nihongo|"Illustration of Thanks-to"|恩頼図|Onraizu}}], drawn after Norinaga's death by one of his disciples. The words which Norinaga had relation of are arranged in a shape of turnip, in order to express what he was — in other words, the turnip means Norinaga himself on the illustration.

==People==

[[Kosuzu Motoori]] is a worker at Suzunaan. [[Hieda no Akyuu]] also appears to use it as a tool for her own research.

Apparently, there's at least one other resident seen at Suzunaan -- who is most likely Kosuzu's parent, judging by the language used in their conversation -- but further details are unknown.

==History==

Not much is known about the history of Suzunaan, but it has apparently been known by [[Reimu Hakurei]] and [[Marisa Kirisame]] since some time prior.

{{nihongo|'''TORIFUNE'''|トリフネ}}, sometimes referred to as {{nihongo|'''Satellite TORIFUNE'''|衛星トリフネ}} or the {{nihongo|'''Torifune Ruins'''|鳥船遺跡}}, was a Japanese space station of the [[Outside World]]. TORIFUNE was designed as a self-contained ecosystem of hardy plants and animals, in order to gather data to be used for terraforming parts of Earth. Possibly due to its resemblance to Noah's Ark, the station was named after Ame-no-Torifune (a kami of ships) and a shrine to him was built inside.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Trojan Green Asteroid]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Control of the station was lost a few years before the events of ''[[Trojan Green Asteroid]]'' due to a mysterious computer [[Glitch|bug]], but an automated system moved it to rest safely at a [[wikipedia:Lagrangian point|Lagrangian point]] between the Earth and [[Moon]]. Since retrieving it would be difficult, and all life aboard was presumed dead, contact with the station has not been made since then. Critics said "Japan's engineers have spent a large sum of money just to make a ruin in space".

In truth, the station's interior has become an overgrown jungle, while some of its animal species have mutated into [[chimera]]e.

{{Uwabami note}}
The {{nihongo|'''Twilight Bar Room'''|黄昏酒場|Tasogare sakaba|also translated as '''Twilight Bar-room''', '''Twilight Bar''' or '''Twilight Pub'''}} is where all of ''[[Uwabami Breakers]]'' take place. Apart from this game, nothing else official in existence has made reference to this place. The name also appears as the Japanese title of the game.

==General Infornation==
It's a mysterious place when you get really drunk, as you usually find yourself flying around the place dodging [[danmaku|bullets]] from food and drinks (drunkenly, of course). It's even said that you can see an [[Gensokyo|illusionary world]] by morning. Unfortunately, people would usually get a hangover by then as they won't remember a single thing they seen or did.

===Geography and people===
The Twilight Bar Room is a skyscraper that isn't located in [[Gensokyo]], but judging on [[Tatsumi Hakkaisan#Official Profiles|Tatsumi]]'s profile about joining the [[wikipedia:Japan Self-Defense Forces|SDF]]&lt;ref name="zun"&gt;''[[Uwabami Breakers]]'': [[Uwabami Breakers/Translation/Staff Notes#ＺＵＮ後書き.txt|{{lang|ja|ＺＵＮ後書き}}.txt]]&lt;/ref&gt;, it's in the [[outside world]] in Japan. Its whereabouts is unknown, but [[ZUN]] calls it "a mysterious land where only drunkards live."&lt;ref name="zun"&gt;''[[Uwabami Breakers]]'': [[Uwabami Breakers/Translation/Staff Notes#ＺＵＮ後書き.txt|{{lang|ja|ＺＵＮ後書き}}.txt]]&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the [[stage]] titles of the game: there's a public house called the {{nihongo|"Eight-headed Orochi"|八岐大蛇|Taishū izakaya "yamatano'orochi"}}; "Bar C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;OH", which means "Ethanol" and it's a place of night-time social life; and {{nihongo|"Saturday Night Garden"|サタデーナイトガーデン|satadēnaitogāden}}, which is on the rooftop of the bar.

Many people go to the bar to drink heavily till dawn and can become obsessed with the food sold there, as there are new menus daily. The bar is owned by [[Rumi Arie]] who abuses her customers when they don't pay their tabs. She also supervises on her two employees: [[Tatsumi Hakkaisan]], who is the chef that cooks there; and [[Amakasu Barley Tenji]], who works as a bartender and does some disco dancing there.&lt;ref name="zun"&gt;''[[Uwabami Breakers]]'': [[Uwabami Breakers/Translation/Staff Notes#ＺＵＮ後書き.txt|{{lang|ja|ＺＵＮ後書き}}.txt]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Isami Asama]] is seen drinking daily at the Twilight Bar Room.

The {{nihongo|'''Underground Geyser Center'''|間欠泉地下センター|kanketsusen-chika sentaa}} is a facility under the surface of [[Gensokyo]], under the base of the [[Youkai Mountain]]. Both the [[kappa]] and the [[god]]s at the [[Moriya Shrine]] perform a variety of experiments and research projects. It is connected to the [[Nuclear Furnace]] in the deepest part of the [[Underworld]].

==Story==
The Underground Geyser Center is the main location of [[Sanae Kochiya|Sanae]]'s story in ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]''. She travels into it while following the giant robot, [[Hisoutensoku]].

The facility also plays a large role in ''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]''. After the events of ''[[Subterranean Animism]]'', there are still [[Evil spirit|evil spirits]] lurking there, making it unfit for humans to be.

==Origin==
The Underground Geyser Center inspiration is the {{nihongo|"Suwa Lake Geyser Center"|諏訪湖間欠泉センター|Suwako Kanketsusen Sentā}}, situated near the Suwa Lake Geyser, the most active geyser in Japan. The center also serves as a tourist site as one of the nearby spa's facilities.

The '''Underworld''' ({{lang|ja|地底}} ''chitei'', underground) is a world beneath the surface of [[Gensokyo]], and consists of many regions. It is the main focus of the plot of [[Subterranean Animism]]. It's suggested that it's a separate world from [[Gensokyo]].

==General Information==
The Underworld is made up of several different layers. The highest one, which is still very far below ground, is known as [[Former Hell]], which was once Hell long ago, before the [[Yama]]s decided to relocate due to overpopulation. The [[Former Capital]] and the [[Palace of the Earth Spirits]] are located on this layer, supposedly at the center of what used to be Hell.

Below that, accessed via a hole in the courtyard of the Palace of the Earth Spirits, is the [[Remains of Blazing Hell]], which produces the heat for Former Hell. Below even that lies the [[Nuclear Furnace]], seen in Stage 6 of ''[[Subterranean Animism]]'', which is kept alight by [[Utsuho Reiuji]], and functions the main power source for the rest of the Underworld. Even lower is the [[Hell of Blood Pools]], where the emotions of countless organisms congeal as blood that can be perceived as oil. 

===Underground Geyser Center===
{{main|Underground Geyser Center}}
The '''Underground Geyser Center''' is also located below ground, at the foot of the [[Youkai Mountain]]. This experimentation center set up by [[Kanako Yasaka]] and [[Suwako Moriya]] connects to the [[Nuclear Furnace]].

The {{Nihongo|'''Untrodden Valley'''|未踏の渓谷|Mitou no Keikoku}} is a valley located at the very base of the [[Youkai Mountain]] through which a river running from the [[Waterfall of Nine Heavens]] courses. The kappa's hideout, the home of the [[kappa]] as mentioned in ''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'', lies somewhere on land in this area.&lt;ref name="PMiSSKappa"&gt;[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]: [[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Kappa|Kappa]]&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Appearances==
;''Mountain of Faith''
The valley was introduced as the 3rd stage scenario of ''[[Mountain of Faith]]''. It was here where the heroine encountered [[Nitori Kawashiro]], who didn't want [[human]]s going up the [[Youkai Mountain]].

;''Double Spoiler''
The valley appears on stage 4 of ''[[Double Spoiler]]'', where [[Aya Shameimaru]] and [[Hatate Himekaidou]] encounters [[Nitori Kawashiro]] and [[Momiji Inubashiri]] to try and take photos of their [[danmaku]]. There are 7 scenes in this stage.

;''Wild and Horned Hermit''
During the events of the [[Wild and Horned Hermit#Chapter Four|fourth chapter]] of ''Wild and Horned Hermit'', the kappa living in the valley were approached by the members of the [[Moriya Shrine]] with the idea of engineering a dam. However, in their impatience and eagerness, the kappa caused a landslide and created a natural dam, blocking the river and risking a flood. [[Kanako Yasaka]] promptly handled the problem, and within no time the kappa began work on building a mechanized dam. It proved to be a fruitless endeavor however, as kappa do not work well in teams, and the project was cancelled. 

;''Impossible Spell Card''
The valley appears on the sixth day of ''[[Impossible Spell Card]]'', where [[Seija Kijin]] finds herself in the valley and carries on defending herself from other [[youkai]] who are trying to capture her. On Scene 1, she is confronted by [[Mamizou Futatsuiwa]], who tells her that the [[tengu]] are reporting her to stronger [[human]]s and [[youkai]], but also aids her to realise that she can use two items at once and has a quick duel with her. After, she'll fight against [[Aya Shameimaru]], [[Hatate Himekaidou]], [[Momiji Inubashiri]] and [[Nitori Kawashiro]] as they try to capture her with their "impossible" [[spell card]]s. There are 8 scenes total in the day. Even after Seija left the area, the tengu indeed spreaded rumors about her actions, making more people going after her. The previous day was located at the [[Skies of Gensokyo]], whilst the next day is located at the [[Netherworld]].

The {{Nihongo|'''Waterfall of Nine Heavens'''|九天の滝|Kyuuten no Taki}} is one of the many large waterfalls of the [[Youkai Mountain]]. White [[Wolf]] [[tengu]] patrolers such as [[Momiji Inubashiri]] hide behind the waterfall, watching for intruders and launching surprise attacks if any such are spotted.

==Background Information==
It is likely the waterfall receives its name from [[wikipedia:Li Bai|Li Bai]]'s poem "View of a Waterfall at Lushan", where the famous Tang Dynasty poet expresses his admiration of the majestic waterfall in [[wikipedia:Mount Lu|Mount Lu]]:
{|
|-
|
:Sunlit, the Incense Summit, aglow in smoke and steam;
:To afar like a shimmering curtain, a waterfall hangs up-stream:
:Rolling, flying, fluttering ~ plunging three thousand feet,
:As if ‘twere the [[wikipedia:Milky Way|Silver River]], falling from Heaven Supreme.&lt;ref&gt;Translation by Andrew W.F. Wong, from [http://chinesepoemsinenglish.blogspot.com/2009/09/li-bai-view-of-waterfall-at-lushan.html "{{lang|zh|李白: 望廬山瀑布}} Li Bai: View of a Waterfall at Lushan"], Classical Chinese Poems in English.&lt;/ref&gt;
||
:{{lang|zh|日照香爐生紫煙}}
:{{lang|zh|遙看瀑布掛前川}}
:{{lang|zh|飛流直下三千尺}}
:{{lang|zh|疑是銀河落九天}}
|}
"Nine Heavens" is the literal translation of {{nihongo|||九天|Kyuuten}}, though the translator here has opted its metaphorical meaning "Heaven Supreme".

==Appearances==
;''Mountain of Faith''
Stage 4 of ''[[Mountain of Faith]]'' took place along this waterfall. The theme "[[Fall of Fall ~ Autumnal Waterfall]]" is associated with this location. Here, the heroine will fly up the waterfall, only to be attacked by [[Fairy|fairies]] and [[Sunflower Fairy|sunflower fairies]], who were hiding behind the waterfall. Halfway, they'll be attacked by [[Momiji Inubashiri]], who's quickly defeated. By the time they get to the top, a group of [[crow]]s will fly through the screen and [[Aya Shameimaru]] will show her face.

;''Double Spoiler''
The waterfall appears on the spoiler [[stage]] of ''[[Double Spoiler]]'', where [[Aya Shameimaru]] and [[Hatate Himekaidou]] will encounter each other, insulting each other's newspapers and declaring war, trying to take each other's photos of their [[danmaku]]. There are 9 scenes in this stage.

The {{Nihongo|'''Wind God's Lake'''|風神の湖|Fuujin no Mizuumi}}, also called the {{nihongo|'''Youkai Mountain Lake'''|妖怪の山の湖|Yōkai no Yama no Mizūmi}}, is a great lake located at the heights of the [[Youkai Mountain]]. It was transported into [[Gensokyo]] by [[Kanako Yasaka]] before the events of ''[[Mountain of Faith]]'' along with the [[Moriya Shrine]], which is also located nearby. The lake is named after Kanako who, although revered as a goddess of mountains, is in fact a goddess of wind and rain.&lt;ref name="MoFchar&gt;[[Mountain of Faith]]: Character setting.txt&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background Information==
Large pillars known as {{nihongo|[[Onbashira]]|御柱}} surround the lake's perimeter, and these are decorated with [[wikipedia:Shimenawa|shimenawa]] and [[wikipedia:Shide (Shinto)|shide]]. As of ''[[Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom]]'', these aren't shown. Onbashira, literally meaning "honored pillars", are part of a festival held at [[wikipedia:Suwa taisha|Suwa Grand Shrine]] named the {{nihongo|Onbashira Festival|御柱祭|Onbashira matsuri}}. It is held every six years at the shrine, and involves the replacement of previous wooden pillars with newly chopped ones.

As with the Moriya Shrine and the Suwa Grand Shrine, the Wind God's Lake is based on and perhaps intended to be [[wikipedia:Lake Suwa|Lake Suwa]], although unlike the former there is nothing in its name to suggest a correlation besides the proximity between the lake and the Moriya Shrine.

==Appearances==
;''Mountain of Faith''
It was the location of the battle between the heroine and Kanako in the final stage of ''[[Mountain of Faith]]''. The stage's theme is ''[[Cemetery of Onbashira ~ Grave of Being]]''.

;''Double Spoiler''
The waterfall appears on [[stage]] 11 of ''[[Double Spoiler]]'', where [[Aya Shameimaru]] and [[Hatate Himekaidou]] encounters [[Kanako Yasaka]] and [[Suwako Moriya]] to try and take photos of their [[danmaku]]. There are 8 scenes in this stage.

;''Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom''
The lake re-appears as the [[stage]] 2 of ''[[Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom]]'', where there are no pillars visible. [[Moon rabbit]]s from the [[Moon]], named [[Ringo]] and [[Seiran]], are trying to purify Earth and have setten up a base at the lake near the [[Moriya Shrine]].

The {{nihongo|'''World of Fantasies'''|幻夢界|genmukai}} is an intermediary world that appears on stage 3 of ''[[Story of Eastern Wonderland]]''. Apparently, its only "inhabitants" are the [[Two Red Dots]], [[puffball]]s and the [[Five Magic Stones]]. In the game, [[Reimu Hakurei]] passes through it on their way to [[Reimaden]] and it was the place where she met the Magic Stones. She had to defeat them in order to pass.

==General Information==
[[Genjii]] mentions that it is locked between their original world ([[Gensokyo]]) and [[Makai]]. There is a dark background with various stars in the appearance of outer space, but Genjii mentions it's actually nothing of the sort.  There appears to be two rocky walls on both sides of the screen. The walls eventually come to an end, leading into an opening where the [[Five Magic Stones]] can be found. It's unknown whether [[Reimaden]] is part of the World of Fantasies or part of [[Makai]] since Genjii stated that the World of Fantasies is between "their world" and Makai. It's also unknown if Mima still lurks around this place.

==Additional Information==
*On [[stage]] 2 of Makai, the stage is titled "The Border Between The Human World And Makai". It is unknown of this border has any relations to the World of Fantasies.

{{Nihongo|'''Youkai Mountain'''|妖怪の山|Youkai no Yama}} is [[Gensokyo]]'s largest mountain and volcano. As its name implies, it is inhabited almost exclusively by [[youkai]], primarily [[kappa]] and [[tengu]], and where [[human]]s are generally not welcome.

Initially described in ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'', it later became a key location in ''[[Mountain of Faith]]'' when the [[Moriya Shrine]] was transported near to the mountain's summit.

==General Information==
[[File:PMiSS youkaimountain.jpg|thumb|170px|left|Smoke rising from the mountain as illustrated in ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]''.]]
The Youkai Mountain is a rocky landform covered by a large expanse of forest named [[#The Great Youkai Forest|The Great Youkai Forest]] at its foot, with waterfalls and rivers flowing from the lakes at the mountain top. It is known to have been a highly active volcano in the past, but it has been a long time since it last erupted.&lt;ref name="CiLRch4"&gt;[[Cage in Lunatic Runagate]]: [[Cage in Lunatic Runagate/Fourth Chapter|Chapter 4]]&lt;/ref&gt; Smoke is still seen rising from the mountain from time to time. Commonly, when someone says {{nihongo|"The mountain"|山|yama}}, it usually refers to the Youkai Mountain.

It has served as the home of [[youkai]] since long before the time of man and is a high threat to [[human]]s.&lt;ref name="PMiSSYoukaiM"&gt;[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]: [[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Youkai Mountain|Youkai Mountain]]&lt;/ref&gt; Consisting of a close-knit societies of [[kappa]] and [[tengu]], the mountain is closed off from outsiders and its inhabitants lead peaceful communal lives.&lt;ref name="PMiSSYoukaiM" /&gt; Outsiders that attempt to climb the mountain, youkai or human, are chased out relentlessly by the tengu patrols. Because no outsiders are allowed, and because the kappa and tengu keep their secrets so close, many things about the mountain remain a mystery to other dwellers of [[Gensokyo]].&lt;ref name="PMiSSYoukaiM" /&gt; Additionally, the ruins on the western side of the mountain are inaccessible to both humans and youkai.&lt;ref name="SoPmNue"&gt;[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]]: [[Symposium of Post-mysticism/Kakashi Spirit News 1|Aliens From a Burning Fireball?]]&lt;/ref&gt; Recently,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'': Chapter 39&lt;/ref&gt; the mountain has become more open to humans with the construction of the [[Moriya Ropeway]], which allows passengers to travel to the [[Moriya Shrine]] and back without passing through tengu lands.

There are rumours stating that there exists a large hollow cavity within the mountain, where a futuristic utopia just like the [[Outside World]] is being built, but the tengu's newspapers may not be telling the truth. The sun's light shines all day long there, and an automated factory produces the necessary items to meet the needs of everyday life, and the youkai drink sake while reading the newspaper and discussing the news, living blissfully. Within this hollow cavity, the forbidden act of opening a hole that connects to the outside world through the boundary is perpetrated, so other humans and youkai are not allowed to enter.&lt;ref name="PMiSSYoukaiM"&gt;[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]: [[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Youkai Mountain|Youkai Mountain]]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also a number of [[yamanba]] living on the mountain, who have their own territory and rarely interact with its other inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Hidden Star in Four Seasons]]'': [[Hidden Star in Four Seasons/Story/Aya's Scenario|Aya's Scenario]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geography and people===
Their stable habitat has allowed the tengu and kappa to develop highly advanced technology.&lt;ref name="PMiSSYoukaiM" /&gt; Many technological facilities such as factories and research centers can be found here. Kappa facilities specialize in ironworks, creating weapons and tools, whereas tengu factories include printing presses for newspapers and other publications ([[Bunbunmaru Newspaper]] and [[Kakashi Spirit News]] among them).&lt;ref name="PMiSSYoukaiM" /&gt; The [[Underground Geyser Center]], a facility where a variety of experiments and research projects are carried out, lies deep under the ground beneath the mountain.

Notable tengu that live here include [[Aya Shameimaru]] and [[Hatate Himekaidou]] (both Crow tengu), [[Momiji Inubashiri]] (White Wolf tengu) and [[Tenma]], leader of the tengu. It is unknown exactly where the tengu's settlement is located on the mountain or what it is like, but it is most likely to be located high up the mountains above the [[Waterfall of Nine Heavens]], near to where the heroine faced off against Aya Shameimaru in stage 4 of ''[[Mountain of Faith]]''.

Bhavaagra, a realm within [[Heaven]], can easily be reached from the mountain top, presumably due to its closeness to the sky.{{cn}} It's said that the [[Shining Needle Castle]] is located in the sky not far from the mountain.

Incidentally, the mountain was used in the naming of Aya's ''Mountain of Faith'' theme, ''[[Youkai Mountain ~ Mysterious Mountain]]''.

===History===
Before being sealed inside of [[Gensokyo]] by the [[Great Hakurei Barrier]], the mountain was known as [[wikipedia:Yatsugatake Mountains|Yatsugatake]].&lt;ref name="CiLRch4" /&gt; It was once much taller than [[wikipedia:Mount Fuji|Mount Fuji]], but it was torn down in a fit of jealousy by the [[god]]dess [[Konohana-Sakuyahime]], who couldn't stand there being a mountain greater than her own Mount Fuji.&lt;ref name="CiLRch4" /&gt; Sakuyahime's elder sister, [[Iwanagahime]], tired of her sister's attitude, moved to Yatsugatake and settled there, where she remains to this day.&lt;ref name="CiLRch4" /&gt; The smoke rising from the mountain is produced by her,&lt;ref name="CiLRch4" /&gt; but due to its long inactivity [[human]]s have come to think that the smoke comes not from the volcano but from the many factories located in the mountain. The mountain in Gensokyo is said to be the original form of Yatsugatake, before it was destroyed by Sakuyahime.&lt;ref name="CiLRch4" /&gt; 

The mountain was formerly ruled by the [[oni]], with the tengu and kappa as their subordinates.&lt;ref name="PMiSSOni"&gt;[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]: [[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Oni|Oni]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SA-M&amp;N"&gt;[[Subterranean Animism]]: [[Subterranean Animism/Translation/Marisa and Nitori's Scenario|Marisa and Nitori's Scenario]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to the creation of the Great Hakurei Barrier and the rapid decline of dedicated oni exterminators, the oni grew tired of how uneventful Gensokyo had become and left the mountain.&lt;ref name="PMiSSOni" /&gt; With their superiors nowhere to be found, the tengu and the kappa were quick to take charge, with the tengu building upon what was left behind by the oni.&lt;ref name="PMiSSOni" /&gt;

The Moriya Shrine and a great lake named the [[Wind God's Lake]] were brought over from the [[Outside World]] some time before the events of ''[[Mountain of Faith]]''. Its [[god]]desses and [[shrine maiden]] caused a great disturbance among the mountain's original inhabitants, but the conflict was eventually settled and now they are accepted as residents of the mountain.

==Locations==
The mountain is composed of several sectors, settlements and landmarks.

===Moriya Ropeway===
:[[Gensokyo Timeline|In 2017]], an aerial tram was completed that connects the foot of the mountain directly to [[Moriya Shrine]], allowing humans to access it without passing through youkai territory.

===Foot of the Youkai Mountain===
:The {{nihongo|'''Foot of the Youkai Mountain'''|妖怪の山麓|Yōkai no Sanroku}}, or {{lang|ja|妖怪の山の麓}} is what it literally states. [[Shizuha Aki]] and [[Minoriko Aki]] can be found here. This is the location of [[stage]] 1 in ''[[Mountain of Faith]]'', ''[[Double Spoiler]]'', ''[[Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom]]'', and ''[[Unconnected Marketeers]]'' although for these to be the same location is unlikely.

===The Great Youkai Forest===
:{{Nihongo|'''The Great Youkai Forest'''|妖怪の樹海|Youkai no Jukai}} is a great forest located at the foot of the mountain. It is a dark forest that sunlight does not penetrate and its atmosphere is heavy.&lt;ref name="MoFReimu"&gt;[[Mountain of Faith]]: [[Mountain of Faith/Translation/Reimu's Scenario|Reimu's Scenario]]&lt;/ref&gt; It was featured in stage 2 of ''Mountain of Faith'' with the theme ''[[The Road of the Apotropaic God ~ Dark Road|The Road of the Misfortune God ~ Dark Road]]''.

===The Waterfall of Nine Heavens===
{{Main|Waterfall of Nine Heavens}}
:The {{Nihongo|'''Waterfall of Nine Heavens'''|九天の滝|Kyuuten no Taki}} is one of the many large waterfalls of the mountain. White Wolf tengu patrolers such as [[Momiji Inubashiri]] hide behind the waterfall watching for intruders and launching surprise attacks if any such are spotted.

===The Wind God's Lake===
{{Main|Wind God's Lake}}
:{{Nihongo|'''The Wind God's Lake'''|風神の湖|Fuujin no Mizuumi}} is a great lake located at the heights of the mountain. It was transported into Gensokyo by [[Kanako Yasaka]] before the events of ''Mountain of Faith'' along with the [[Moriya Shrine]], which is also located nearby.

===The Moriya Shrine===
{{Main|Moriya Shrine}}
:{{Nihongo|'''The Moriya Shrine'''|守矢神社|Moriya Jinja}} was among the things transported over from the [[Outside World]] into [[Gensokyo]]. [[Kanako Yasaka]], [[Suwako Moriya]] and [[Sanae Kochiya]] live within the shrine.

===Kasen Ibaraki's Mansion (Senkai)===
[[File:WaHHCh03Kasen'sMansion.png|thumb|150px|Kasen's home as seen in ''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'']]
:[[Kasen Ibaraki]]'s home lies somewhere deep within the mountain close by the Moriya Shrine, hidden within her own climate-controlled version of [[Senkai]].&lt;ref name="WaHHCh37"&gt;''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'': Chapter 37&lt;/ref&gt; It is described in ''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'' as being a large mansion by Sanae, though Kasen herself refers to it as a [[wikipedia:Dojo|dojo]].&lt;ref name="WaHHCh2"&gt;''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'': Chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt; A scroll with the 8th stage towards enlightenment depicted in [[wikipedia:Ten Bulls|Ten Bulls]], namely "Both Bull and Self Transcended", can be seen hanging from her wall.

===Peony Field===
:[[Eirin Yagokoro]] grows a field of [[wikipedia:chinese peony|chinese peony]] somewhere on the mountain for pharmaceutical purposes.&lt;ref name="OSPCh14"&gt;''[[Oriental Sacred Place]]'': Chapter 14&lt;/ref&gt;

===Secret Heaven Cliff===
:The {{Nihongo|'''Secret Heaven Cliff'''|秘天崖|Hitengai}} is the cliff where yamawaro live. Humans are strongly prohibitted to be around there by them.

===False Heaven Shelf===
{{Main|False Heaven Shelf}}

It was a [[stage]] location in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'' and ''[[Urban Legend in Limbo]]'' that's associated with [[Mamizou Futatsuiwa]]. There is also a night version of this stage. On that stage, there appears to be open space, with having trees behind the scenery.

The {{nihongo|'''Youkai Trail'''|妖怪獣道|Yōkai Kemonomichi}} is a narrowed path that, on one end, should lead to the [[Human Village]]. [[Mystia Lorelei]] is known to lurk around here.

==General Information==
Little is known about this location. According to [[Sakuya Izayoi]], this place has beauty that she didn't know because she travels here at night. The road tends to lack [[human]]s, because it is infested with [[youkai]], in particular [[beast]]-types. Even though it's a road for youkai, the end of it doesn't have youkai due to being close to the village. Mystia states that humans who do come here are "idiots".

Apparently, Mystia has a stand set up here that sells [[Grilled Lamprey]]. She tricks bypassers into thinking that this food will cure their night-blindness, although it is Mystia that's causing this herself.

==The Trail's Appearances==
===Games===
;''Imperishable Night''
The trail appears as the [[stage]] 2 of ''[[Imperishable Night]]''. Although the location of this stage wasn't given an official name, the texture and structure of the background is the same as the "Youkai Trail" stage in the next game despite a discolouring, along with having Mystia in the same location. The heroines are trying to head towards the [[Human Village]] whilst fighting [[Fairy|fairies]] and [[kedama]], but encountered [[Mystia Lorelei]]. Before her appearance, the top of the screen will glow red. She attacks as a midboss because she believed there was a human present, but stays in front of the heroines throughout the stage. She was eventually defeated.

;''Phantasmagoria of Flower View''
The Youkai Trail appeared as a stage location in ''[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]'', in which [[Mystia Lorelei]] is dedicated to this location. The stage generally appears on stage 1, 2 or 3 in all scenarios of the game, except for [[Komachi Onozuka]]'s. During this event, it was daytime, since the previous game had the location at night. Various characters will come here to look for leads towards the flower incident, only to find and defeat Mystia. In [[Eiki Shiki, Yamaxanadu]]'s scenario, she'll come here to see if Mystia has been keeping up with what she (is supposed to have) learnt from the [[yama]], to which she hasn't.

===Spin-offs===
;''Shoot the Bullet''
The trail appears in ''[[Shoot the Bullet]]'' on [[Stage]] 1. Although there is no direct evidence that the location of Stage 1 is the Youkai Trail, the images for the background from both this game and ''[[Imperishable Night]]'''s Stage 2 background are exactly the same. Here, [[Aya Shameimaru]] encounters [[Rumia]] and [[Wriggle Nightbug]] to try and take photos of their [[danmaku]]. This being the first stage of the game, this is where Aya starts her adventure of taking photos of various characters' danmaku. There are 6 scenes total in this stage, and the next stage is at the [[Misty Lake]].
