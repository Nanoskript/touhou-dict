{{nihongo|'''Alice Margatroid'''|アリス・マーガトロイド|Arisu Māgatoroido}} is a doll-controlling [[magician]] who lives in her home in the [[Forest of Magic]] near the home of [[Marisa Kirisame]]. According to ZUN's comments in the Music Room of ''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]'', Alice is kind of a special character in the ''[[Touhou Project]]''.

==General Information==
Alice made her first ever appearance of the fifth [[PC-98]] ''[[Touhou Project]]'' game ''[[Mystic Square]]'' as the third [[stage]] [[boss]] and the Extra stage boss. Afterwards, with her [[canon]] completely remodelled, she appeared again as the third stage boss and midboss in the seventh work ''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]'' and as a playable character in ''[[Imperishable Night]]'', along with being a playable partner in ''[[Subterranean Animism]]''. She was a playable character in ''[[Immaterial and Missing Power]]'' and ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]'' and was the Final boss of [[Cirno]]'s scenario in ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]''. Additionally, she was a target on Stage 3 of ''[[Shoot the Bullet]]'' and has made a background appearance in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]''.

She is a pure all-purpose-type [[magician]] [[youkai]] who lives in a western-style house in the [[Forest of Magic]] without strengths and weaknesses in attributes, but she fundamentally fights in style of manipulating her self-made [[doll]]s. With a personality that is indifferent to other people, she is attached to magic, and is usually confident but is also timid in one aspect.&lt;ref name="th075_txt"&gt;''[[Immaterial and Missing Power]]'': character profile&lt;/ref&gt;

In the games on the [[PC-98]], she lived in [[Makai]] calling herself "The [[Magician]] of Makai" and had a black book that's called the "[[Grimoire of Alice]]". Makai was created by [[Shinki]], along with its residents. She was also a [[magician]] that can control [[doll]]s. She also created her own "Wonderland" in Makai. In ''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]'', she said, "at last, former friend, we meet again. Have you only brought me your life as a gift?" which can be considered to be something carried over from the PC-98 games, and [[ZUN]] himself said that it was the third time that they have fought.  

===Personality===
According to ''Perfect Memento in Strict Sense'', maybe since she was originally a human, even as a youkai, she has high understanding and friendship level to humans and presents a low danger level, and if someone gets lost in the [[Forest of Magic]], she also gladly gives shelter upon arriving at her house. However, Alice's house is covered all over with dolls, and since she is not very eager for conversation, it seems like visitors immediately flee when there is something eerie.&lt;ref name="PMiSSAlice"/&gt;&lt;ref name="th075_txt"/&gt; When she showed her hospitality was in ''[[Immaterial and Missing Power]]'', when she led [[Sakuya Izayoi]] out of the forest, who had become lost. &lt;ref&gt;''[[Immaterial and Missing Power]]'' - [[Immaterial_and_Missing_Power/Story/Sakuya's_Scenario|Sakuya's Scenario]]&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
In chapters 5-6 of ''[[Strange and Bright Nature Deity]]'', the [[Three Fairies of Light]] accidentally arrived at her house and Alice was hospitable to them, providing tea and cake. She seemed caring with the fairies.

She's attached to magic, but she is indifferent to other people. She doesn't perform the usual act of attacking humans like most youkai, but she unexpectedly likes fights and upon being challenged to battle, she gladly accepts. As she manipulates a great number of combat dolls, the fight is compelled to be highly outnumbered, making a difficult battle inevitable, but since she has her hands full with manipulating the dolls, that is her weakness.&lt;ref name="PMiSSAlice"/&gt;

She's an indoors type who was often alone,&lt;ref name="th08_txt"&gt;''[[Imperishable Night]]'': {{lang|ja|キャラ設定}}.txt&lt;/ref&gt; but in ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'', the range of her place of activities is "any kind of place" in [[Gensokyo]], she performs her share of intermingling with the village, appearing in front of people in times of festivals to exhibit her skills with dolls. In each ending of ''Imperishable Night'' and ''Immaterial and Missing Power'', she participated in banquets at the [[Hakurei Shrine]]. In addition to things like "the frog dolls being popular," there have also been expressions that indicate that her dolls are well-received in the village. She also said things that hinted that she sometimes visits the library of the [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Immaterial and Missing Power]]'': [[Immaterial and Missing Power/Story/Alice's Script|Match mode win quote (Alice beats Patchouli)]]&lt;/ref&gt; She has an obsession with collecting things, especially magic items.

===Abilities===
; Strength 
[[File:GoMIllus-Alice.jpg|thumb|192px|Alice Margatroid, as illustrated in ''[[The Grimoire of Marisa]]''.]]
Unlike Marisa, Alice does not find it enjoyable to win battles with overwhelming power and is more interested in strategy, so she usually fights with power that is a little above that of the opponent and always holds back even if it means losing. It is because if she were defeated using her true strength, then there would be nothing left afterwards, which resembles [[Reimu Hakurei]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]'' - Character Settings.txt&lt;/ref&gt; It is unknown if this is fundamental to her personality, or if this is simply something she judged as an efficient strategy that her secret skills should not be shown.

Related to this, in ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]'', among the 15 characters, she did not have a cost 5 [[spell card]], which might be an example of not showing her true strength. However, in ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]'', a cost 5 spell card was added. In the first place, since in ''[[Imperishable Night]]'', she had a Last Word just like other characters, which were supposed to exemplify each of the characters' full strength, it does not mean that she never displays her full strength (with an appropriate spell card) no matter what the situation. On the other hand, it could also be that her last word spell card ''The Phantom of the Grand Guignol'' was actually still going easy.

In ''Immaterial and Missing Power'', she kept avoiding the really strong characters&lt;ref&gt;''[[Immaterial and Missing Power]]'' - [[Immaterial and Missing Power/Story/Alice's Scenario|Alice's Scenario]]&lt;/ref&gt;, not fighting those like [[Remilia Scarlet]] and [[Yuyuko Saigyouji]], spending her efforts to get to [[Suika Ibuki]]. It is unclear what state of mind she had at that time to do such a thing. Incidentally, it was the same in ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]''. Concerning this, she succeeded in her goal when she met [[Sakuya Izayoi]], [[Patchouli Knowledge]], and [[Youmu Konpaku]], as she judged that it would a waste of effort to meet Remilia and Yuyuko, but she did engage in a battle with the powerful [[Yukari Yakumo]]. Additionally, she felt comfortable testing her [[Goliath Doll]] on [[Cirno]] in ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]''.

During the [[PC-98]], she obtained the "[[Grimoire of Alice]]", a book that produced "the ultimate magic", and it seems like it would contain amazing magic that couldn't be used without reading it.

;Handling dolls
[[File:SBND05Dollsshoveling.jpg|thumb|192px|Alice's dolls shovelling snow in ''[[Strange and Bright Nature Deity]]''.]]
[[File:SBND06Dollsrepairing.jpg|thumb|192px|Alice's dolls repairing a window in ''[[Strange and Bright Nature Deity]]''.]]
As her specialty is making [[doll]]s, she is also able to manipulate a great amount of dolls at the same time. This skill is among the finest in [[Gensokyo]].&lt;ref name="th075_txt"/&gt; She is able to make her dolls move pretty much any way [[human]]s can, and other than that she can make multiple dolls perform different actions, sometimes making them cooperate and sometimes making them move completely asynchronously, such that to onlookers around her, it might not seem like she is manipulating them. Due to this, [[Marisa Kirisame]] commented that "she said that she controls all the dolls herself, but that sounds like a whopper". The dolls can themselves manipulate and maybe even create other dolls, but it seems that Alice insists on creating new dolls herself.&lt;ref name="PMiSSAlice"/&gt; In chapter 5 of ''[[Strange and Bright Nature Deity]]'', she gave a command to a doll orally, but at that time she was indoors while at the same time there were at least 12 dolls above the roof removing snow, and there were also some dolls inside the room cooking. At that time, the dolls have been portrayed as having emotion, in a cute way.

Although in common perception, it would seem obvious for the dolls to be able to talk, but there has been no mention of conversational ability. In some official material however, like ''[[Imperishable Night]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s [[Imperishable Night/Translation/Prologue|Prologue]] and ''[[Strange and Bright Nature Deity]]'' [[Strange and Bright Nature Deity#SaBND Chapter Five|chapter 5]], Alice's [[doll]]s appear to be able to act and talk independently – someone adds in words in [[wikipedia:Hiragana|hiragana]] to Alice's words. In Marisa's B Ending in ''[[Subterranean Animism]]'', it has been confirmed that the dolls do talk in [[wikipedia:Katakana|katakana]]. Whether the dolls are talking due to manipulation by Alice or if half-automatic dolls are talking by themselves is a big mystery. However, according to her [[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Alice Margatroid|''Perfect Memento in Strict Sense'' article]], she hasn't yet succeeded in creating an independent doll, and a conversation between [[Marisa Kirisame]] and [[Rinnosuke Morichika]] in ''[[Curiosities of Lotus Asia]]'' [[Curiosities of Lotus Asia/Chapter 16|chapter 16]] suggests that Alice just controls the dolls and pretends they are alive for her own amusement and for showing off, but these talks were before the latter said game.

According to ''[[Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red]]'', her objective is to make a completely autonomous doll that have their own thoughts and move by their own volition. Currently, when Alice gives a command to her dolls, they move as if they were autonomous, but she has to periodically give commands to them, and moreover it seems like she has not have had enough training in order to achieve it. In ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]'', she unleashes a move called "Semi-[[Robot#Automaton|automaton]]". Because of that, it can be seen that the degree to which the ordinary Alice manipulates the dolls is clearly not all by herself. In order to perfect a completely autonomous doll, Alice does experiments, and the link to that with the "soul" is detailed.

However, according to her conversation with [[Youmu Konpaku]], it was said that "the strings that attach the body and soul are the same as the ones that control dolls". If this is originally considered, then it could be asked, "isn't that which was put into the dolls Alice's own spirit?". It is not explained, for the dolls that she is experimenting with, if she needs to periodically give them magic power or if they are just fine without, and if they will move even if she does not give them any commands at all. However, in ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]'', Alice did say "it seems that it's more convenient to control the dolls myself than have dolls that think on their own".

Among Alice's famous skills, if the explanations of "Edo High-Explosive Pawn" and "Lemmings' Parade" are looked at, she also prepares her dolls for explosives. In ''[[Subterranean Animism]]'', it seems that the dolls that she lent to [[Marisa Kirisame]] have been prepared with gunpowder, and due to this she objected to Marisa since they wouldn't survive in the [[Hell of Blazing Fires]]. Certainly in the game, the dolls didn't randomly explode. Also, in ''Magic Sign "Artful Sacrifice"'' as well as the skills ''"Volatile Doll"'', ''"Doll Cremation"'' and so on, she is able to put in magic power into the dolls to make them explode. It's unclear what the relation or difference is between the dolls that use gunpowder and the dolls with magic power put into them. One Lemmings' Parade consumes an enormous number of dolls, and since all the dolls are hand-made by Alice, to ordinary people, it would seem that without reason she returns her hard work to waste in an instant. However, it could be questioned as to whether Alice really adopted such a bad technique for such efficiency, and there is also the consideration that the dolls could merely be creating a blast from their explosion without scattering and dispersing, so that they are able to be collected again.

===Possessions===
;Dolls
[[Shanghai]] and [[Hourai]] are the two most well-known [[doll]]s (or types of doll, rather) used by Alice. The [[Goliath Doll]] is another doll created by Alice, which appears to still be in the testing stages and is thought to be her strongest doll.

;Grimoire
In ''[[Mystic Square]]'' Extra Stage, Alice appears with a black book with ''"Grimoire of Alice"'' written on it, from she recites spells. In ''[[Imperishable Night]]'' she appears with a black book with a writing that possibly spells out "Grimoire". This is some evidence that the book is possibly the same Grimoire which Alice used in the Extra Stage. However, in latter games and in ''[[Immaterial and Missing Power]]'' she appears with a book with a black cover without nothing written. It's not sure if it's a different book or not, but it's known she stills has it thanks to works as ''[[Strange and Bright Nature Deity]]'', where she accuses the [[Three Fairies of Light]] of being the ones who are trying to steal it.

===Species===
In her ''[[Imperishable Night]]'' profile, she is said to be a [[magician]] as a species, in contrast to [[Marisa]], who is a human that practices magic. In ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'', she is described as a magician youkai that used to be human and became a magician by using "abandon food" magic.&lt;ref name="PMiSSAlice"/&gt; It is unknown if she has also studied "abandon worms" magic to become a complete magician; without this magic, she would still possess a lifespan similar to humans. It is also said&lt;ref name="PMiSSAlice"/&gt; that she has only recently become a magician, and because of this, she apparently still continues human habits like eating and sleeping, despite them not being necessary.

In ''[[Mystic Square]]'', Alice appears as a [[Makai]] resident and refers to Reimu as "human", implying that she may not be one in PC-98 canon.

==Character Design==
[[File:PMiSS_alice.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Alice, as illustrated in ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]''.]]
===Origin===
ZUN states that he originally based her off Alice from ''[[wikipedia:Megami Tensei|Megami Tensei]]'' and Alice from ''[[wikipedia:Asura Blade: Sword of Dynasty|Asura Blade]]''.&lt;ref name="MS omake"&gt;[[Mystic_Square/Translation/Other#OMAKE.txt|Mystic Square omake]]&lt;/ref&gt; Of course, a major inspiration is also the titular protagonist of [[wikipedia:Lewis Carroll|Lewis Carroll]]'s famous novel ''[[wikipedia:Alice's Adventures in Wonderland|Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' - the majority of enemies in ''Mystic Square''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Extra Stage are card soldiers of the same type as those in the [[wikipedia:Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Walt Disney animated movie version of the novel]]. The title of the theme used in that stage also directly translates to "Alice in Wonderland".

===Name===
Her full name is {{nihongo|''Alice Margatroid''|アリス・マーガトロイド}}. She had no surname in ''Mystic Square''. Her surname, ''Margatroid'', is derived from a real surname, [[wikipedia:Murgatroyd|Murgatroyd]]. The inspiration is most likely Miss Murgatroyd from [[wikipedia:Agatha Christie|Agatha Christie]]'s book ''[[wikipedia:A Murder is Announced|A Murder is Announced]]''. Murgatroyd is also a nickname for the [[vampire]] in Kim Newman's ''[[wikipedia:Anno Dracula (novel)|Anno Dracula]]''. On a more interesting note, in the [[Wikipedia:BBC Radio 4|BBC Radio 4]] adaptation of the previously mentioned Agatha Christie book, ''Alice'' Arnold was responsible for the role of Miss Murgatroyd.

===Design===
Alice was first seen in ''[[Mystic Square]]'' wearing a pink/white dress with a blue apron, a matching headband with a ribbon on the side, as well as white socks. She has blonde hair and gold eyes like in all of her later appearances (except ''Perfect Cherry Blossom''). Since the Extra Stage, she carries her signature grimoire.

In ''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]'', she has blue eyes and has a red band in her hair. She wears a light blue dress with long white sleeves and two pink ribbons, one going round her neck and another one around her waist.

In ''[[Immaterial and Missing Power]]'', Alice's sprites show her to have blue eyes, but they're gold in her portraits. Her book is wrapped up in a red ribbon, and she has strings on her fingers to control her dolls. She is also seen wearing black boots. Her sprites in ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]'' and ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]'' were unchanged.

Upon first glance she is said to look like a doll.&lt;ref name="PMiSSAlice" /&gt; Her height is stated to be "fairly tall"&lt;ref name="height"&gt;[[ZUN's E-mails]]&lt;/ref&gt;.

Alice made a background cameo appearance in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'' on the [[Human Village]] stage. She is seen at the far right-hand side of the screen standing around. 

===Literature===

;''Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red''
{{Main|Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red/Alice|l1=Article and Interview: Alice}}
Alice was making straw effigies and nailing them to trees behind the [[Hakurei Shrine]], what made [[Aya Shameimaru]] think that someone was cursing people. However, after some time, she could interview Alice and she explained that wasn't the case, as she only was doing that as part of her investigation to create a full independent doll.

In the interview, Alice claims that if anybody sees the ritual will be weaker and that if Aya could stay away from those dolls, it will perfect. When asked about why she wants to make an independent doll, she comments that long ago she saw something like that, and after that she started thinking ways to make one.
;''Strange and Bright Nature Deity''
In ''[[Strange and Bright Nature Deity]]'', she provided help as inviting the [[Three Fairies of Light]] to her home and providing tea and cake. She told them, "if you got lost, then stay here until the snow goes away," brought some hot red tea, inquired if the room was cold, and also said "well, you should have gotten pretty cold walking outside, so you should just relax and warm up." However, afterwards, when [[Sunny Milk]], in some random saying, said something which suggested of stealing the Grimoire, she became very angry and was ready to attack the fairies when some birds broke into her house and started biting the fairies. After they told her that they were really fairies, she said that it was not use to fight and leave them leave.

==Relationships==
===Marisa Kirisame===
[[Marisa Kirisame]] is a fellow magician of the [[Forest of Magic]]. They were partners in ''[[Imperishable Night]]'', and she was supporting Marisa in ''[[Subterranean Animism]]''. Within the [[PC-98]] canon, Alice met Marisa and that they fought during the events of ''[[Mystic Square]]'', but the dialogues leaves open that they may've known each other earlier than that. They also fought each other in ''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]''. It isn't official that Marisa has ever stolen anything from Alice.

In ''Imperishable Night'', they've teamed up as a "bad relationship" combination. At that time the reason why Alice called out Marisa with her voice for this reason (incident resolution), is that it's only because they've become used to it. By the time of the events of ''[[Subterranean Animism]]'', Alice sent Marisa to the [[Underworld]] saying that it was a "onsen-enjoyment game". Compared to the time of ''Imperishable Night'' they've had less arguments, which might mean their relationship is better.

She seems to have a rivalry of sorts with Marisa, with the two often insulting and fighting each other, yet teaming up on several occasions. For all the bickering the two go through, they seem to be close friends, as Alice once recommended Marisa's shop to the [[Three Fairies of Light]] when they needed some [[youkai]] extermination.

===Dolls===

[[Shanghai]] and [[Hourai]] are the two most well-known [[doll]]s (or types of doll) used by Alice. The [[Goliath Doll]] is another doll created by Alice, which appears to still be in the testing stages and is thought to be her strongest doll.

===Minor Relationships===
;[[Mima]]	
At the end of [[Mystic Square]], Mima takes Alice as her maid, releasing her some time later.
;Three Fairies of Light
In ''[[Strange and Bright Nature Deity]]'', although they lied to Alice telling her that they weren't fairies who prank humans, at the end she decided that being bit by birds is enough and she let them leave her house without any grudge. 
;[[Eirin Yagokoro]]
Alice purchases the [[Butterfly Dream Pill]] from Eirin.

==Additional Information==
*Alice appeared on the cover of ''[[Mystic Square]]'' with a [[Minor_Characters#Unnamed_cat_on_MS_cover|cat]].
*Alice appeared in the Music Room background of ''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]''.
*Being known as the "Seven-Colored Puppeteer" or "Rainbow Puppeteer", Alice apparently believes in a correlation between color and power. During her dialogue with [[Reimu Hakurei]] in ''Perfect Cherry Blossom'', she asserts Reimu's powers are only equal to 28.5714% (or 2/7) of her own powers, due to Reimu's outfit only consisting of two colors. This appears to be a recurring theme in ''Perfect Cherry Blossom'', as [[Yukari Yakumo]], [[Ran Yakumo]] and [[Chen]] are all named after colors and have relative power equivalent to their colors' place on the visual spectrum. This, however, has not been referenced in recent games.
*Alice's alternate palette from ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]'' resembles Hina-Ichigo, a doll from the manga series ''[[wikipedia:Rozen Maiden|Rozen Maiden]]''. In ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]'', she has palettes resembling the other Rozen Maiden dolls: Suiseiseki, Souseiseki, Suigintou, Shinku, Kanaria, and Kirakishou. Add the fact that, in ''Rozen Maiden'', the aforementioned dolls are battling for the title of "Alice", the perfect doll.
*Alice is one of the two characters in the whole series who appears 3 times in a single stage: Twice as a midboss and the third as the actual boss of stage 3 in ''Perfect Cherry Blossom''. The other is [[Seiran]] in ''[[Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom]]''.
*Alice is one of the five characters in the whole series who appears as a boss two times in different stages of the same game: As the third and extra boss in ''Mystic Square''. The others are [[Rika]] in ''[[Story of Eastern Wonderland]]'', [[Yuuka Kazami]] in ''[[Lotus Land Story]]'', [[Junko]] in ''[[Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom]]'' and [[Okina Matara]] in ''[[Hidden Star in Four Seasons]]''.
*Alice seems to have connections with ''[[Dolls in Pseudo Paradise]]''. One involves how one of the honest men died from being "nailed to a tree" despite being inside, which relates to [[Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red/Alice|Alice's article in ''Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red'']] about her nailing straw effigies to trees. Others include how the men stumble upon a "Western-style building deep within the forest" and how the culprit was a "beautiful blonde girl".
*Alice has been a recurring customer of Eirin's, coming to see her to buy a medicine she developed called the [[Butterfly Dream Pill]].&lt;ref name="BAiJREirin"&gt;''[[Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red]]'': [[Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red/Eirin|Eirin Yagokoro]]&lt;/ref&gt; The medicine guarantees its imbiber to have pleasant dreams once they fall asleep, and was even featured in an article in Aya's newspaper. The reason for purchasing this medicine or even what kinds of dreams Alice is trying to have were never revealed, but instead are left purely to speculation. However, this might be a reference to "Alice in Wonderland", from which the concept of her character is derived.
*In chapters 6 of ''[[Strange and Bright Nature Deity]]'', Sunny Milk mentions that she's looking for a magician with a grimoire that "shines wonderfully with all the seven colors of the light". Alice does not deny this to be false. This might be the in-universe explanation for her title, "Seven-Colored Puppeteer".

'''Alice Margatroid'''

The stage 3 boss, kinda ordinary [[magician]].&lt;br /&gt;
Mainly she possess the ability to handle magic.

She is a versatile magician, that has no specific strong or weak point in any area. If you ask me, she is similar to [[Marisa Kirisame|Marisa]], or rather I'd say a [[youkai]] version of Marisa.

Alice has an obsession with collecting things as well, and has the habit of collecting magic items, especially magic books. As they both share the same hobby, she often clashes with Marisa so their relation is like loggerheads. Most recently, she is interested in collecting dolls that have a story associated with them.

She had no evident reason to attack [[Reimu Hakurei|Reimu]] and company. They were chosen for the target of her magic because they were there. Dominating the enemy with overwhelming power is not fun at all for Alice, so she always sees her opponent's reaction and tries to fight with power that exceeds the opponent by a hair. Even if she loses, she doesn't show her full power.

That's because she thinks it would be the end of the rope for her if she lost with full power. In this aspect, her personality is somewhat similar to Reimu.

'''Alice Margatroid'''

Species: [[Magician]]&lt;br /&gt;
Location: Moderate sized house in the [[Forest of Magic]] (has no specific name)&lt;br /&gt;
Ability: Ability to handle magic

A pure [[magician]]. While her appearance is almost identical to [[human]]s, she is not one.

She is a kind of so called humanoid [[youkai]].

Her house is crammed with a lot of dolls. The sight is so spooky that it scares rare visitors away. The house of dolls is strangest even in the forest of the bizarre. It's no wonder that they tend to run away from there.

Her personality is indifferent to others, and is easily attached to magic. She puts on a confident attitude, but she actually also has a timid side.

She is quite average in melee fighting. Both her body movement and magic using are average. Instead of that she has very high skillfulness, which enables her to control many dolls as if they're living beings. This skillfulness is among the finest among all of [[Gensokyo]].

*'''Seven-Colored Puppeteer, Alice Margatroid'''

A [[magician]] living in the [[Forest of Magic]].

She possess the ability to use magic. Puppetry is a type of magic too.

She rarely goes out by herself, but she had no other choice this time.

She has many similarities to [[Marisa Kirisame|Marisa]], namely living in the Forest of Magic, being a magician and having an obsession with collecting things.

However, they have an absolute difference in that Alice is a magician as a species while Marisa is a human magician.

Other than that, they're also different in using forest's mushroom as preference or not.

Of course, Alice is the one not using them. However, it is not because of such matter that makes both on bad terms.

Magic is her weapon. A magician's magic is always originally developed by the magician.

:''Notes''
:She teams with [[Marisa Kirisame|Marisa]] this time.
:Normal speed only applies when she is used as a solo character.
:Her laser penetrates and lasts as long as the player wishes, so it's unexpectedly strong. Good against both bosses and weaklings.
:It's her doll that is shooting the laser though.
:Recommended for those who want to be done quickly.

A magician living in the [[Forest of Magic]].

The greatest difference between Alice and [[Marisa Kirisame|Marisa]] is that Marisa is a [[human]] of magician occupation whereas Alice is a magician as a species.

You might imagine magicians as being indoor-type people; in Alice's case, you'd be right. She spends most of her time alone, and the forest is a good place for that.
The forest is quite humid, however, and her dolls will become damaged without her constant care. Because of this, she's currently planning to make a doll that will automatically take care of other dolls.

A puppeteer that lives in the forest.

She felt something odd about the geyser that erupted, but since youkai prefer not to go underground she worried over what to do.  That's when she noticed that Marisa was especially interested in the geyser, so she convinced Marisa to investigate the underground for her. She told her that investigating the hot spring would be a fun game, and pointed her towards the source of the geyser. She also made her carry dolls that had Yukari's remote control devices in them.

{{nihongo|'''Aunn Komano'''|高麗野 あうん|Komano Aunn}} is a komainu who guards places of religious worship.

==General Information==
Aunn appears as the [[Stage]] 3 [[Boss]] in ''[[Hidden Star in Four Seasons]]''. She is a komainu youkai who guards places of religious worship. This includes the Hakurei Shrine, even though Reimu was unaware Aunn was protecting her shrine until Hidden Star in Four Seasons. Ironically, Reimu beats her up for intruding.

She is content with guarding sacred places, considering it a kind of "volunteer work".

===Personality===
Aunn has a very kind and simple personality. She holds no ill-intent against anyone or anything. Her nature as a komainu is that of a guardian. She loiters around Shrines and Temples and guards them without being asked. Aunn only shows her full power against something with ill intent, and even so, she is not very strong. She usually loses.

===Abilities===
;Ability to locate Shintoism and Buddhism
She can track down temples and shrines to guard them. Besides this rather mundane ability, she also seems to have some instinct for evil, as she senses in the Four Seasons Incident that Cirno's power comes from someone with devious intentions. That being said, she can appear in two bodies at the same time, as in one of her Spellcards, which makes a reference to Komainu always being set up as pairs. This is also alluded to with the title of her song {{nihongo|''A pair of beasts''|一対の神獣}}. However, according to their own statements in The Grimoire of Usami, both parts can only make the same movement at the same time, and in the long run, this power exhausts them greatly.
==Backstory==
Prior to the events of [[Hidden Star in Four Seasons]], Aunn was just a normal komainu statue. During the incident, she became a sentient [[youkai]] due to the magical energy coming out from the backdoor that [[Okina Matara]] placed on her. Even as a statue she was conscious of her surroundings, and she was able to see and recognize Reimu and other characters while in that state. Not only that, apparently she could see from the inside of various statues, as she explained how she was watching not only the [[Hakurei Shrine]], but also other places.

==Character Design==
===Name===
Her full name is {{nihongo|''Aunn Komano''|高麗野 あうん}}. The characters for {{nihongo|''Komano''|高麗野}} are spelled with {{nihongo|''ko''|高}} "tall,  high", {{nihongo|''ma''|麗}} "lovely, beautiful, graceful", and {{nihongo|''no''|野}} "plains, field".&lt;br&gt;
{{nihongo|''Komano''|高麗野}} is a reference to her species {{nihongo|Komainu|高麗犬}}, as it shares the first two characters. Her last name can be roughly translated as "Korean/Goryeo plains".

The name {{nihongo|''Aunn''|あうん}} is representative of a traditional characteristic of komainu statues. Komainu generally come in pairs; one will have their mouth open, and the other closed. The open mouth is said to be pronouncing Sanskrit "a", and the closed one "un" – together forming the sound ''[[wikipedia:Om|Aum / Om]]'' (ॐ), which is a syllable sacred in many religions including Buddhism and Hinduism, signifying the start and end of everything. The sound is transliterated in Japanese as {{nihongo|''[[wikipedia:A-un|A-un]]''|阿吽}}.

===Design===
Aunn has light skin, green eyes, and long seafoam-color hair.  Her hair is multi-layered, the longest of which extends down past her waist into multiple points.  A shorter shoulder-length layer lies beneath with inward curls, as do her bangs.
She has a grey cylindrical horn on top of her head and grey horn-shaped ears.  These have a [[Wikipedia:Magatama|magatama]]-shaped design where the large base is where her ears would be and curving upward and out, with an accented ridge running their length; the tip very slightly curves upward in the opposite direction. Her eyebrows, usually hidden underneath her bangs, are unusually round.

Aunn wears a red short-sleeved collared [[Wikipedia:Kariyushi shirt|Kariyushi shirt]] with 3 round white buttons down the middle, one up top and two below.  Her shirt is decorated with white cloud designs and the design forms a heart shape in the middle.
She also wears white shorts with wide openings for her legs, adorned with bright red cloud designs and a thick, darker red trim on the bottom edge.
She wears a pair of two-tooth [[Wikipedia:Geta|geta]] that have red ''hanao''. She also has a curly tail, not visible on her game portrait&lt;ref&gt;[[Hidden Star in Four Seasons/Music#Stage 3 boss - Aunn Komano's theme|Aunn Komano's theme]]&lt;/ref&gt;, but noticeable in her [[Wild and Horned Hermit]] and [[Lotus Eaters]] appearances.

;''Hidden Star in Four Seasons''
After being brought to life by Okina Matara's powers, Aunn begins to protect the Hakurei shrine. She unsuccessfully tries to drive away the characters she perceives as intruders - Cirno and Aya Shameimaru - but also those belonging to the shrine - Marisa Kirisame and Reimu Hakurei - attack her, since they don't know her. After the fight, she tries to give them clues, but does not know anything more specific about the incident.

===Literature===
;'''''Wild and Horned Hermit'''''
In chapter 42 of ''Wild and Horned Hermit'', Aunn reassures Reimu and Kasen that the Four Seasons incident is over. The two question who she is, and Aunn cheerfully reminds them that she has been watching them for a long time. At the celebration of the end of the incident, [[Okina Matara]] reveals that she created Aunn from a komainu statue at the front of the shrine. 

;'''''Lotus Eaters'''''
She repeatedly makes background appearances, but doesn't have an actual role besides that.

==Relationships==
===Minor Relationships===
;[[Reimu Hakurei]]
Aunn claimed to have been guarding the shrine at times when Reimu was gone. Reimu seemingly has no idea who Aunn is. In chapter 42 of [[Wild and Horned Hermit]] it is revealed that before the four seasons incident she was a simple komainu statue, but Aunn was still capable of seeing and sensing her surroundings. This explains why Aunn knew Reimu and the others, but no one knew about her.
;[[Marisa Kirisame]]
While one-sided at the time, Aunn acted as if she'd known Marisa for quite some time when they first encountered each other. Like with Reimu, Marisa has no idea who Aunn is.
;[[Okina Matara]] (creator)
Okina is the one responsible for Aunn becoming a sentient youkai. This was caused by the magical energy coming out from one of Okina's doors on the back of a regular komainu statue.&lt;ref&gt;Wild and Horned Hermit - Chapter 42&lt;/ref&gt;

She found a strange, bottomless spiritual power welling up in her heart, and felt something cold running down her back.&lt;br /&gt;
Though she didn't know where or what it was, she sensed that ''something'' deeply important was being deliberately concealed in Gensokyo.

{{nihongo|'''Aya Shameimaru'''|射命丸　文|Shameimaru Aya}} is the main protagonist of [[Shoot the Bullet]] and [[Double Spoiler]]. She is [[Gensokyo]]'s resident reporter, known for writing "slightly" exaggerated news articles about anything that happens in [[Gensokyo]]. She's very strong and is probably stronger than she shows since she sometimes "accidentally wins" battles while only meaning to cover a news story.

==General Information==
Aya first appeared in ''[[Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red]]'' official book as the reporter of its articles and made her first game debut in ''[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]''. She is the main protagonist of the spin-off games ''[[Shoot the  Bullet]]'' and ''[[Double Spoiler]]'' where she fights against various characters while taking pictures of them. She appears again in the mainline games as the Stage 4 Boss in ''[[Mountain of Faith]]'' and as a playable partner with [[Reimu Hakurei]] in ''[[Subterranean Animism]]''. She is also a playable character in [[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]], made an appearance as a background character in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'' and appeared as a Day 6 Boss in ''[[Impossible Spell Card]]''. ''[[Hidden Star in Four Seasons]]'' reintroduces her as a playable character. Like in ''[[Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red]]'', Aya appears as the main character in ''[[Alternative Facts in Eastern Utopia]]'', and once again fills the role of reporter for the articles of the book. 

===Personality===
Aya is unrelenting when it comes to getting sensationalist news stories, and she frequently twists the truth in her writing to her own advantage. Although her stated policy is to report only the truth, she has often written blatant lies. When people like [[Yukari Yakumo]] or [[Hecatia Lapislazuli]] asked if she was becoming a conspiracy theorist after thinking too hard about what's behind the truth &lt;ref&gt; ''[[Alternative Facts in Eastern Utopia]]'' - '''"The outsider's free travel threatens youkai's existence and disturbs public order. However, could it be that this crisis was calculated?"'' Article &lt;/ref&gt; or that all she does is choosing the truth that's most beneficial for her and try to dye the world in that color, &lt;ref&gt; ''[[Alternative Facts in Eastern Utopia]]'' - [[Hecatia Lapislazuli]]'s article &lt;/ref&gt; respectively; all she said was that Ms Yakumo was being evasive and that she only tells the truth. In the Epilogue of ''[[Alternative Facts in Eastern Utopia]]'', she explains that the main reason she canceled the publication was because of the goddess's words about a person with the power to twists the truth between the lunarians, and because she realized she had been with [[Sagume Kishin|said person]] before. As a result, Aya declares that she decided to cancel the weekly publication to prevent the lunarians of using them to their advantage.

However, Aya has shown a serious side as well. She can be thoughtful about the effect her stories will have on those who read them. She resents the rigid tengu caste system, as even though she works hard, she is unable to advance in rank due to being a crow tengu. 

It is said that she will come politely asking interviews of humans and youkai alike if she sees them as worth writing an article about, but will forcefully drive away any who interfere. [[Hieda no Akyuu]] writes that she is generally the sort of youkai one does not wish to oppose, but if one somehow manages to cross her, her strength is practically unrivaled. &lt;ref name="PMiSS"&gt; ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Aya Shameimaru|Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'' - Aya's Article &lt;/Ref&gt; 

===Abilities===
;Manipulating wind
With this ability, Aya can cause wind of incredible strength whenever she pleases. Somehow, this also allows Aya to "listen" to the wind to collect rumors, aiding her in the journalism business. Many of her [[spell card]]s in the fighting games show this ability a lot. Her powers are among the top class in [[Gensokyo]], and not many can challenge her with a real chance of winning. However, she doesn't like fighting much, nor does she show off her power a lot. This seems to be a common characteristic among Tengu.

;Speed
While Tengu as a whole are known for their incredible speed that few can match, Aya prides herself of being ''"the fastest"'' in Gensokyo, and has been refered to as such by ZUN.&lt;ref&gt;[[Chara☆Mel/Mountain of Faith interview with ZUN]]&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Marisa Kirisame]] not even [[Remilia Scarlet]], that was apparently able to fly around the [[Moon]] in an extremely short amount of time, can compare to Aya's speed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Silent Sinner in Blue]] - Chapter 16&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mountain of Faith/Spell Cards/Stage 4#Spell Card 51|One of her spell cards]] shows some extent of her speed, but her actual limits are unknown.

===Occupation===
Aya runs the [[Bunbunmaru Newspaper]], which is viewed by most [[human]]s and [[youkai]] in [[Gensokyo]] as a mildly popular gossip or tabloid paper. She has a shameless reporting style, tends to exaggerate events, and expresses her own personal opinions in her articles. As a result, many don't want to see themselves in her newspaper, and she is on less than good terms with some of the other characters. Still, she does have ethics, and is more interested in pursuing the truth (sometimes to a fault) than ruining other peoples' reputation for the sake of it.

Her depiction in [[Strange and Bright Nature Deity]] and [[Curiosities of Lotus Asia]] suggest that her newspaper isn't well received, and she is willing to jokingly trick Reimu into believing in a fictional type of ghost to boost its popularity.

==Character Design==
[[ZUN]] once commented that the gaming concept of ''[[Shoot the Bullet]]'' was around since the same time he created ''[[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]]''. As such a game required a camera-using character, Aya was created specifically to fit that purpose.
===Name===
[[File:BAiJRAya.jpg|thumb|190px|Aya's appearance in ''[[BAiJR]]'']]
Her full name is {{nihongo|''Aya Shameimaru''|射命丸　文}}. The characters for {{nihongo||射命丸|Shameimaru}} literally means, in sequence, "to shoot (an arrow)" (or "to shine into/onto"), "command", "decree", "order" or "life" (or "hit/target" in the word ''meichuu'' {{nihongo||命中|meichuu}}), and "circle" (common name ending, usually seen in names of crafts and swords or similar weapons, and is also a very common suffix for the names of ships). {{nihongo||文|Aya}} means "text", "sentence" or "literature", and it's also the first character of "Bunkachou". The name {{nihongo||射命丸|Shameimaru}} is derived from [[Wikipedia:Sha-Mail|Sha-Mail]] (Shamēru → Shameimaru), which is text messages with photos, very appropriate for a fast-traveling journalist who takes pictures.

Aya owns the {{nihongo|''Bunkachou''|文花帖}}, a [[tengu]] notebook gathering innumerable photographs and handwritten notes. {{nihongo||文|Bun|also pronounced as ''aya''}} means "sentence, text", {{nihongo||花|ka}} means "flower", "blossom" (or "pretty", "cute thing" in a figurative sense) and {{nihongo||帖|chou}} means "notebook": therefore ''Bunkachou'' literally means "notebook of flowering sentences": her record of interesting observations for [[Bunbunmaru Newspaper]] articles and pictures of beautiful ''[[danmaku]]'' or cute girls living in Gensokyo.

===Design===
Aya has red eyes and semi-long black hair. She wears a white blouse, black short skirt, and a [[Wikipedia:Tokin (headwear)|tokin]]. From ''[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]'' to ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]'' she can be seen holding a hauchiwa fan. In ''[[Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red]]'', ''Phantasmagoria of Flower View'', and ''Scarlet Weather Rhapsody'', Aya is shown holding a notebook and being accompanied by a crow. She was depicted with black wings for the first time in Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red.

In ''[[Double Spoiler]]'', Aya now carries a camera and wears an orange armband reading {{nihongo||「取材中」|Shuzaichuu|lit. "collecting material/the scoop"}}. She is also notably depicted with pointed ears, compared to the normal-looking ears that were visible in her ''[[Mountain of Faith]]'' portrait. In ''[[Hidden Star in Four Seasons]]'' her skirt is based on Hanafuda October suit.

During the events of ''[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]'', she sets out to cover what promises to be an interesting news story, apparently having had completely forgotten that the exact same event had occurred 60 years ago. Even though she was alive and around during the previous flower incident, perhaps her memory is clouded by the thousands of facts and rumors she hears every day.

;''Mountain of Faith''

:{{Main|Mountain of Faith/Translation/Reimu's Scenario#Stage 4|l1=Reimu's Arc|Mountain of Faith/Translation/Marisa's Scenario#Stage 4|l2=Marisa's Arc}}
When Aya was sent by the other [[Tengu]] to see who the intruder on [[Youkai Mountain]] was during ''[[Mountain of Faith]]'' she was surprised to see it was the heroine. Although Aya doesn't want to fight the heroine, she prioritizes her bosses' orders. She decides to "go easy" on the heroine and leads her to the new shrine, believing that the heroine could get rid of a large nuisance to the [[Tengu]].

;''Subterranean Animism''
:{{Main|Subterranean Animism/Translation/Reimu and Aya's Scenario|l1=Reimu and Aya's Scenario}}
During the events of ''[[Subterranean Animism]]'', Aya assists [[Hakurei Reimu|Reimu]] using a device given to them by [[Yukari Yakumo]] to stay in contact between the surface and the underground to solve the incident regarding the earth spirit's sudden eruption from a newly formed geyser. Aya's secondary objective throughout the story is to gain exclusive scoops and interviews through Reimu's journey deeper in the underground.

;''Hidden Star in Four Seasons''
[[File:Th16AyaSprite.png|frame|Aya's back sprite in ''HSiFS'']]
:{{Main|Hidden Star in Four Seasons/Story/Aya's Scenario|l1=Aya's Scenario}}
Aya goes off to investigate an incident regarding the abnormal weather in the different areas of [[Gensokyo]] to write an article asking anyone who appears if they know anything about the cause of it. She then comes to the realization that this incident might be more than meets the eye.

She appears as a cameo in the bad endings in [[Unconnected Marketeers]], creating an article mocking the protagonists for losing.

:{{Main|Shoot the Bullet#Story|l1=Shoot the Bullet Story}}
Aya is the main protagonist and the only playable character in ''[[Shoot the Bullet]]''. She sets out to take photographs of various Touhou [[boss]]es for reasons only she knows. Aya has three different speeds, and has a unite screen that can be used to take photos of [[danmaku]], as well as cancelling bullets within the shot. She doesn't shoot bullets as she's no intention in defeating her opponents and that she doesn't want her own bullets in the photos.

;''Scarlet Weather Rhapsody''
:{{Main|Scarlet Weather Rhapsody/Story#Aya's Story|l1=Scarlet Weather Rhapsody Story}}
During the events of ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]'', Aya goes around doing her job, and after an encounter with [[Reimu Hakurei|Reimu]] and [[Marisa Kirisame|Marisa]] she decides to infiltrate the [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]] to report on the [[Remilia Scarlet|Scarlet Devil]] and write an article about her. Remilia mentions something about the weather incident, and Aya goes back to the Youkai Mountain. There she meets an infuriated Reimu complaining about an earthquake destroying her shrine. In spite of the situation, Aya defeats her as an intruder.

;''Touhou Hisoutensoku''
:{{Main|Touhou Hisoutensoku/Translation/Aya's Script|l1=Touhou Hisoutensoku Story}}
If connecting ''Scarlet Weather Rhapsody'' with ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]'', then Aya can become a selectable character to play with, although she appears in no scenarios.

;''Double Spoiler''
:{{Main|Double Spoiler#Story|l1=Double Spoiler Story}}
Aya once again appears in ''[[Double Spoiler]]'' as a sequel to ''[[Shoot the Bullet]]'', been the main protagonist and one of the two playable characters. She competes with [[Hatate Himekaidou]] for the best newspaper, who is the other playable character. She even appears as a Spoiler stage boss if the player is using Hatate.

;''Fairy Wars''
Aya appeared as a cameo on the Route C1 ending of ''[[Fairy Wars]]''. After [[Cirno]] defeated the [[Three Mischievous Fairies]], she wanted to keep her status as the strongest by defeating a [[youkai]]. She finds Aya who can't be bothered to fight because she hasn't got time, but she suggested that she ought to fight a [[human]] first. It turns out to be [[Marisa Kirisame]], to which this story extends onto the Extra stage.

;''Hopeless Masquerade''
[[File:Th135Aya.png|frame|Aya in ''HM'']]
Aya made a background cameo appearance in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'' on the [[Myouren Temple]] and [[Genbu Ravine]] stage. She is seen standing on top of the temple in the former and on pipe in the latter, taking photographs. She also produces [[Bunbunmaru Newspaper]]s that are shown after each fight.

;''Impossible Spell Card''
In ''[[Impossible Spell Card]]'', Aya (been one of the [[tengu]] mentioned by [[Mamizou Futatsuiwa]]) takes notice of minorities trying to capture the mischief-making [[amanojaku]] [[Seija Kijin]], who also appears to be one of the many [[youkai]] that tries to capture her on day 6. She uses [[spell card]]s that are considered impossible to dodge. She apparently writes up an article about this, which makes stronger [[human]]s and [[youkai]] try to capture Seija.

===Literature===
;''Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red''
Aya appears as the main character, interviewing many other characters and asking them to give information about themselves, or about various events in which they were involved. She also writes about past incidents and notorious places in Gensokyo.

;''Silent Sinner in Blue''
In chapter 20, Aya comes to the [[Hakurei Shrine]] to see if Reimu came back from the Moon to write an article, but it's not until months later that Reimu appears. After hearing about [[Reimu]]'s experience in the [[Lunar Capital]], she decides that it's not appropriate for an article, and decides to follow Reimu, and the residents of the [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]] to the party they were going to do to see if she can write an article or not.

;''Oriental Sacred Place''
In chapter 9, Aya writes about a mysterious floating city that appears above the ground, what got the interest of the [[Three Fairies of Light|Three Fairies]] and [[Reimu]]. While Reimu goes investigate, Marisa takes care of the [[Hakurei Shrine|shrine]], encountering Aya. Marisa asks Aya explanations, to she responds saying that long time ago there was a sea there, where numerous fish and youkai would swim, until it got dryed out. Thanks to a landslide, part of the buried treasures were discovered, and between those there is a clam youkai which could its breath to show illusions to others, like the city. Reimu comes back after seeing the city disappeared, and Aya tricks her and the fairies saying it was an evil youkai's doing.

;''Strange and Bright Nature Deity''
In chapter 19, Aya meets the [[Three Fairies of Light]] and they explain to her that they want to scare [[Reimu Hakurei]]. Aya explains that she could do it, and for that she lies to the shrine maiden saying that her newspapers' words are alive and that they need to be read or a [[tsukumogami]] could appear. After that, she uses her wind powers to blow the newspapers in the warehouse in front of Reimu to make her think they were really tsukumogamis. After that, Reimu becomes paranoid and even tells [[Marisa Kirisame]] to read the newspapers or otherwise they could transform, archiving what the fairies couldn't.

;''Alternative Facts in Eastern Utopia''
In this book, Aya attempts to write and publish a weekly periodical in the style of western "clickbait/outrage" political journalism. In it, she includes many overt and verbatim references to real-world political slogans and talking points associated with populism and nationalism, casting suspicion on or willfully misrepresenting the residents or visitors of Gensokyo she considers "immigrants" (those who live at [[Eientei]], [[Hecatia Lapislazuli]], and [[Sumireko Usami]] in particular), as well as chiding those responsible for maintaining "Gensokyo's isolation" ([[Reimu Hakurei]] and [[Yukari Yakumo]] in particular) as being inadequate in their positions. There are also some advertisements for local small businesses such as the [[Marisa Kirisame|Kirisame Magic Shop]].

As she interviews many of the residents and visitors of Gensokyo with increasingly leading and accusatory questions, she is eventually cautioned by [[Hecatia Lapislazuli]] that spreading an ideology of isolationism and suspicion among Gensokyo's residents will only lead to Gensokyo's eventual decay and downfall, since the nature of Gensokyo is one that relies on forgotten youkai "immigrating" to Gensokyo. Aya decides, after some thought and remembering the goddess' warning about lunarians taking advantage of her, to come clean about the way she manipulated the facts of her interviews and articles, and to not publish that edition of her newspaper.

==Relationships==
Aya has presumably met most of the Windows-era characters at least once for [[Bunbunmaru Newspaper|Bunbunmaru News]] material.

;[[Mamizou Futatsuiwa]]
Mamizou and Aya are shown as being quite underhanded with each other in a fiercely competitive rivalry, although they still find ways to call truces on occasion.

In ''Forbidden Scrollery'', Mamizou and Aya compete in the sphere of social influence of the [[Human Village]] bit pitting the tengu's "traditional" media against Mamizou's "social network" of [[tsukumogami]]. 

In ''Lotus Eaters'', they're seen setting aside their differences, at least temporarily, to work towards the greater good of protecting the [[Human Village]] from immediate danger.

;[[Momiji Inubashiri]]
Fellow tengu of Youkai Mountain.
Whenever she meets her they get in a fight, so they don't get along very well. According to Aya, it seems like Momiji looks down on all crow tengu, but Hatate's comments suggest it's just something personal between Aya and Momiji.

;[[Hatate Himekaidou]]
Fellow tengu and rival of Youkai Mountain.

;[[Reimu Hakurei]]
Ally and potential source of interesting new articles.

;[[Kosuzu Motoori]]
Aya and Kosuzu have become business partners in the selling of the Bunbunmaru Newspaper for the [[Human Village]].

;[[Miyoi Okunoda]]

Aya wanted to expose Miyoi as a youkai for scoops. However, she ultimately decided not to, as Geidontei was too convenient for her. Like [[Suika]] and Mamizou before her, she becomes a customer of the newly established Sanshoku Geidontei.

===Minor Relationships===
;[[Tenma]]
Chief tengu of Youkai Mountain.

;[[Megumu Iizunamaru]]
Megumu is the Chief of the Crow Tengu, which makes her Aya's superior.

==Additional Information==
*Aya is the first character in the ''[[Touhou Project]]'' to originally appear in an artbook, then later in a game.
*A silhouette of Aya occupies the front of the jewel case for ''[[Shoot the Bullet]]''.
*In ''[[Mountain of Faith]]'', Aya is the first stage 4 boss in a [[Windows]] game not to have some sort of gimmick/variation based on the playable character (i.e. [[Patchouli Knowledge]]'s different spell cards in ''[[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]]'', [[Reimu Hakurei]] or [[Marisa Kirisame]] in ''[[Imperishable Night]]'', etc.).
*In ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]'', she has a palette that resembles Ranka Lee from Macross Frontier.
*She is the only character introduced in ''[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]'' to return in a later main game, which is [[Mountain of Faith]].
*Aya has appeared, even as far as mention or reference, in every game in the second generation of the [[Windows]] era up until ''[[Ten Desires]]'', from ''Mountain of Faith'' to ''[[Fairy Wars]]''.

'''Aya Shameimaru'''

Species: Crow [[Tengu]]&lt;br /&gt;
Ability: Manipulating wind

A tengu who has been in Gensokyo for over 1000 years, when oni were still around.&lt;br /&gt;
Her origin is a crow. She has the ability to manipulate wind.&lt;br /&gt;
Her character is honest but not rigid. She is polite to strong people, and deals more firmly with weak people. However, she is always polite when conducting an interview.&lt;br /&gt;
Although her powers are among the top class in Gensokyo, she never uses them just to show off. This isn't only a characteristic of hers, but of tengu in general.

She usually lives on a mountain where the wind always moves at the same speed and the same direction. She loves gossip and is always gathering information exchanged with her fellow tengu. During any exchange, information is warped, and almost all of their stories end up exaggerated.

She is the biggest connoisseur of rumors about the girls of Gensokyo among the tengu. Through observing for herself and collecting information from colleagues, barely a moment passes when she isn't obtaining material. However, much of her material is mingled with rumor.

She writes up her non-periodical newspaper, [[Bunbunmaru Newspaper]], and distributes it among the tengu. It's a newspaper chock-full of rumors.

As the current disaster started up, the tengu were overjoyed. There was much new material to be obtained, based on which they can write up their newspapers.

　　今回は、白狼天狗から侵入者ありとの報告があった。こういう場合、普段は自警隊リーダーの大天狗の総指揮の元、白狼天狗が交渉、及び警備に当たる。

　　しかし、何故か大天狗は報道機関である彼女を呼び出し交渉を命じた。&lt;br /&gt;
　　彼女は首を傾げながら現場に向かうと、その疑問はすぐに氷解した。

　　侵入者は、彼女がいつも新聞のネタにしている人間だったのである。

　　つまり大天狗は、文が侵入者の事を一番理解していると判断して、目的は何なのか聞き出せると判断したのだ。


　　彼女は手加減して戦った振りを見せ、わざと負けた。戦いもしないで山に入れてしまうと、彼女が人間と繋がっていると疑われる可能性があったからである。

　　文は人間に屈した振りをして、最近現れた謎の神社に案内した。大天狗には『侵入者の目的は山から迷惑な来客があったとの事でしたので、天狗社会に矛先が向かないように、最近現れた謎の神社の様子を見に行かせました』と報告した。&lt;br /&gt;

　　それから、天狗の頭領である天魔様と、山の神様の間で秘密の交渉が行われる事になった。&lt;br /&gt;

Aya Shameimaru

Species: Crow [[Tengu]]&lt;br /&gt;
Ability: Manipulating wind

A news reporter on the [[Youkai Mountain]]. A tengu who typically writes local news stories about the girls of [[Gensokyo]].

This time around, she got word from the white wolf tengu that an intruder had entered the mountain. Normally, the white wolf tengu are charged by the great tengu with patrolling the mountain, and conducting negotiations and defensive operations.

However, in this case, the great tengu decided to call on this member of the information media to conduct negotiations. Cocking her head to one side in doubt, she headed to the scene of the event, where her confusion was immediately dispelled.

The intruder was one of the girls she was always covering in her newspaper.

In other words, the great tengu understood that Aya had the most in-depth knowledge of the intruder, and had the best chance of being told outright what the intruder's aim was.


Aya went easy on the intruder, put on a show of vigorously defending herself, and purposefully lost. After all, if she let the intruder enter the mountain without putting up a fight, she would likely be suspected of being an accomplice to the humans.

Aya pretended to lose to the humans, and guided them to the mysterious shrine that had appeared recently. She reported to her superiors that the intruders had no business with the tengu society, but were instead interested in the troublesome, enigmatic shrine that had appeared of late.

The great tengu took in her report, and then commended Aya for turning around a potential threat into an opportunity.&lt;br /&gt;
They then ordered the underling [[Momiji Inubashiri|Inubashiri]] to continue her observation of the humans, and go to investigate the shrine of the mysterious god.


According to Inubashiri's report, the mysterious god and the humans had waged battle, but it was truly a playful event where the two parties seemed to be enjoying themselves. Their respective personalities were bright, and their heads kept level. There was little, if any, real danger - rather, by pursuing a friendly relationship with the shrine, the youkai of the mountain might be better off in the end.

After that, the chief of the tengu, Lord [[Tenma]], entered into secret negotiations with the mountain god.&lt;br /&gt;
The details of their discussions were not made public, but it was made known that they had agreed to share the mountain with each other and pursue friendly relations.


Since then, the tengu and the [[kappa]] came to have faith in their new god.&lt;br /&gt;
Though, it was really more of an agreement to all celebrate together than a matter of faith.

Place of residence: the Youkai Mountain&lt;br /&gt;
Ability: Manipulating wind

Or, perhaps it would be better to say her movement ''is'' the wind.&lt;br /&gt;
She rides the wind, listens to the wind, and can cause wind whenever she pleases.

She's also good at collecting the wind's rumors.

Personality: very intelligent, and courteous towards others. Non-combative.

Her mental faculties are extremely sharp, and turns thoughts about in her head much more quickly than humans.&lt;br /&gt;
It's very difficult to tell what she's thinking. On top of that, she changes her mannerisms to match whoever she's with, so nobody feels entirely comfortable around her.

She doesn't particularly like to fight, but she tends to pick fights a lot. However, not many can really challenge her, so few take her up on it, and she has to just let them be.

She heard that the kappa and the gods of the mountain were up to something, so she went off to report on it, it turned out that the mystery was connected to the underground world.

She figured she could greatly increase her circulation if she wrote a story about it, so she used Reimu to investigate.&lt;br /&gt;
As a tengu, she wanted to avoid actually going underground.

{{nihongo|'''Ayana'''|妖奈}} is a presumed-[[demon]] created by [[Shinki]] found in [[Makai]]'s Pandæmonium who is the stage 5 midboss of ''[[Mystic Square]]''. As she attacks the heroine, she shoots a barrage of [[danmaku]] as she raises both her arms and has three attack patterns. If defeated, she drops a 1-up, but the player is then left with stronger [[demon]]s that are [[stage enemies]] that'll shoot random bullets; not defeating the midboss will minimize the amount of dodging from these enemies. She eventually self-destructs near to the boss fight. Since she has no dialogue with the player, nothing is known about her.

==Character Design==
===Origin===
Her sprite shows that she has blonde hair with a red bow on the top of her head. She wears a red dress that's got long red sleeves with pink polka-dots and a pink bow in the centre with pink frills. She somewhat bears a resemblance to [[Hikariko]], where the details are different and has no wings. [[Medicine Melancholy]] from the [[Windows]] era also has a striking resemblance to Ayana.

===Name===
Like any other [[PC-98]] midboss, this character is nameless. However, some Japanese fans have given her the name {{nihongo|''Ayana''|妖奈}}, where {{nihongo||妖|aya}} means "bewitching", while {{nihongo||奈|na}} refers to the [[Wikipedia:Nara Prefecture|Nara]] prefecture in Japan (but in names is used phonetically, that is, it conveys the sound "na" but doesn't really mean anything). However, she's more notably referred to as {{nihongo|"MS 5th Stage Midboss"|怪綺談五面中ボス}}.

{{nihongo|'''Beerko'''|ビール子|Bīruko}} is a character illustrated by [[ZUN]], who's known to love beer, for "[http://tweetvite.com/event/akibabeer3 The Akihabara Beer Fair]". Beerko has appeared on Akihabara Beer Fair's posters since the third Akihabara Beer Fair that was held in [[wikipedia:Akihabara|Akihabara]], Japan from 25 November to 5 December 2011. It's known that the creator of Beerko is ZUN, but she has no relationships whatsoever to the ''[[Touhou Project]]''.

==Character Design==
===Name===
Her true name is unknown, but {{nihongo|''Beerko''|ビール子}} is a popular name for her among the fanbase. {{nihongo|"ビール"||Bīru}} means "[[wikipedia:Beer|beer]]", and {{nihongo|"子"||ko}} means "child". It's unknown if ZUN has ever used this name. Other fan-made names exist such as {{nihongo|"''Beer girl''"|ビール娘|Bīru musume}}, {{nihongo|"''Wheat-brewing child''"|麦醸子|mugikamosuko}} and {{nihongo|"''Mugino Junko''"|麦野順子}}, but these aren't as popular.

===Design===
Beerko is consistently shown with ochre eyes, green cross lace shoes, a pink-white shirt with frills on the sleeves, and a magenta dress. The dress goes from her chest to her kness, the background of it being a ligher shade compared to the lines, and it has frills on the top and bottom sections. Changes in Beerko's design includes the length of her shirt's sleeves, she (not) having white socks, the color of the bow in her chest and waist (either green or magenta), her hair being short and light brown with a green bow (the bow being similar to [[Rumia]]'s red one), or short and orange with a tail with a magenta bow. In her image for the fifth fair she has insignias and words (in English) despicting beer ingredients (water, yeast, hops, wheat) plus an arrow with the word "Brewing".

{{nihongo|'''Benben Tsukumo'''|九十九 弁々|Tsukumo Benben}} is a [[tsukumogami]], transformed from a [[Wikipedia:Biwa|biwa]]. She is the older sister of [[Yatsuhashi Tsukumo]], though they are technically not blood related, and just became sentient at the same time.

==General Information==
Benben first appeared as the Stage 4 [[boss]] and midboss of ''[[Double Dealing Character]]'', as has also appeared as the fifth day boss of ''[[Impossible Spell Card]]''. As a biwa [[tsukumogami]], she carries a biwa, and uses it in her attacks and for her spell cards.

===Personality===
Benben plays the role of the cool and grown-up older sister, in contrast with her little sister who is reckless and hot-blooded. However, they both dream of a utopia where tools could move freely without the need of youkai or humans using them. &lt;ref name="PDDC"&gt; ''[[Double Dealing Character]]'' - Tsukumo Sisters’ Omake &lt;/ref&gt; 

In ''[[Double Dealing Character]]'', Benben fights (verbally) with her sister Yatsuhashi as to who'll get to attack the player and, depending on the shot type selected, she will fight the heroine or leave in search of another opponent (though it’s important to note that she was under the effects of the [[Miracle Mallet]] at the time).

After discovering that their power was limited by the mallet's magic, they become worried that they'll revert back to being simple tools once it runs out, but with the help of [[Raiko Horikawa]], they were able to discard their old bodies in favor of new ones, allowing them to maintain their existence as tsukumogami.

===Abilities===
;Making sounds and performing on her own
Tsukumo sisters' stated ability. It is not known what it means specifically, but it could be a reference that they were instruments which need an user to be played, and now as tsukumogamis they can make music and perform on their own.

==Backstory==
Both Benben and [[Yatsuhashi Tsukumo]] were once merely an instrument used by others in the [[Outside World]], but eventually they came to [[Gensokyo]]. When the [[Miracle Mallet]] was used, its magical power flooded into them, and they both became tsukumogami at around the same time. However, they quickly learned where their power was coming from (the [[Shining Needle Castle]]) and decided to overthrow society as tools, like [[Seija Kijin]] did as well.

==Character Design==
===Origin===
The motif of hers might be derived from {{nihongo|"Bokuboku Biwa"|琵琶牧々}}, a tsukumogami transforming into [[Wikipedia:Biwa hōshi|biwa houshi]]. It should be pointed that Bokuboku and Kotofurunushi, would-be Benben's and Yatsuhashi's motives, are drawn next to each other in the facing pages of an ukiyoe aritst [[Wikipedia:Toriyama Sekien|Sekien Toriyama]]'s [[Wikipedia:Gazu Hyakki Tsurezure Bukuro|last work]], and that Bokuboku is there on the left side. This means the tsukumogami of koto appears earlier and that of biwa later on the book in the traditional Japanese style, the order when the player choose Type A of any character in ''[[Double Dealing Character]]''.

===Name===
Her full name is {{nihongo|''Benben Tsukumo''|九十九 弁々}}. Her family name "Tsukumo" is a short form of "[[tsukumogami]]", her species of [[youkai]], that was changed into different kanji, which can read as the number "99". Her given name "Benben" likely comes from the name of the goddess [[Wikipedia:Benzaiten|Benzaiten]], as they both have the kanji "{{lang|ja|弁}}" in their names meaning "valve," "speech," or "petal," and because Benzaiten is often depicted holding a biwa. Another possibility is that "Benben" is derived from "ben-ben", an onomatopoeia of deep sound (two deep sounds in this case; "ben" is repeated) from the lute like biwa or shamisen; "be-be-ben" is seen in the bonus chapter of 1st volume of ''[[Forbidden Scrollery]]'' when [[Byakuren Hijiri]] is playing the shamisen.

===Design===
Benben has short lilac hair with two long ponytails, and purple eyes. Her outfit consists of a brown and black dress, with long white sleeves. She is barefooted and wears a small floral accessory in her hair. She also carries a biwa that is chained to her left hand.

==Appearances==
===Games===
;''Double Dealing Character''
[[File:Th14BenbenSprite.png|frame|Benben's sprite in ''DDC'']]
Both Benben and Yatsuhashi appear before the player character in Stage 4, though only one of them fights the player at a time. The fight the player gets is decided by which shot type they choose - if they chose to take their weapon along, they face Benben, and Yatsuhashi earlier on as a mid-boss; if they didn't take their weapon, it's vice-versa. At first, the two of them are under the impression that the heroine is looking to join their side, but it quickly turns violent. After being defeated, she points out the [[Shining Needle Castle]], which is where they're getting their power from.

Between the main game and the extra stage, they were approached by [[Raiko Horikawa]], who explained what had happened - and a way out of their situation. The two tsukumogami had realized that their power was coming from the Miracle Mallet. Not wanting to return to being tools, they successfully replaced the magical power they used to survive as self-aware beings with one from the [[outside world]]. The heroine must fight both of them at once.

===Spin-offs===
;''Impossible Spell Card''
Presumably from hearing or seeing a wanted sign about the mischief-making [[amanojaku]] [[Seija Kijin]], Benben appears to be one of the many [[youkai]] that tries to capture her. She uses [[spell card]]s that are considered impossible to dodge.

==Relationships==
===Yatsuhashi Tsukumo===
[[Yatsuhashi Tsukumo]] is Benben's younger sister, and serves as a hot-headed, energetic counterpart to Benben's cool and collected demeanor. &lt;ref name="PDDC"/&gt; The two of them are both tsukumogami, so they are not technically related by blood; they call themselves sisters because they were both "born" at roughly the same time.

===Raiko Horikawa===
[[Raiko Horikawa]] is a drum [[tsukumogami]] that approached her and Yatsuhashi, and offered to swap out their source of power.

===Minor Relationships===
;[[Seija Kijin]] &amp; [[Shinmyoumaru Sukuna]]
No dialogue is exchanged between these characters; when mentioned by the heroine, Seija appears to realize she's talking about tsukumogami, but no more than that. They all appear to share the same goal of overthrowing society.

Species: Tsukumogami&lt;br /&gt;
Ability: Capable of making sounds and performing on their own

A pair of tsukumogami, each created from a traditional musical instrument.&lt;br /&gt;
Benben plays the part of the cool, grown-up older sister, and Yatsuhashi plays the part of the hot-blooded, reckless younger sister.&lt;br /&gt;
They're said to be sisters, but it's just because they became tsukumogami at the same time. They're not blood relatives.

They realized that the source of their power was the upside-down castle floating in the sky, and set their sights there.

Their goal was to conquer the world with their fellow tools. Social upheaval, in other words.&lt;br /&gt;
They dreamed of an utopia where tools could move freely, and display their abilities to the fullest.&lt;br /&gt;

However, that dream was prevented by Reimu and company.


They still didn't give up, though.
When they realized that their thoughts had been influenced by the Miracle Mallet's magic,&lt;br /&gt;
they tried using incantations to replace their power with a different magic power.

It was the tsukumogami of a percussion instrument that they had never seen before.

This flower-like creature is the first stage midboss of ''[[Lotus Land Story]]'' that attacked [[Reimu Hakurei]] and [[Marisa Kirisame]] on a mountain path. It first appear at the bottom of the screen and digs its way to the top underground, overtaking the player. It'll then pop out of the ground as though its blooming and shoot a barrage of [[danmaku]], but its easily defeated. If the midboss is located at the centre of the screen, then it'll self-destruct. Since it's got no dialogue with the player, nothing is known about it.

==Character Design ==
===Name===
The flower is nameless, but some Japanese fans may call it the {{nihongo|"Bewitching Lotus Flower"|妖蓮花|yourenge}}. It may also be referred to as the {{nihongo|"LLS 1st Stage Midboss"|幻想郷一面中ボス}} or "Youkai Flower Midboss" by Westerners.
===Origin===
Its sprite shows that it's a large lotus-like flower with two large aerials. Some kind of aura floats around the top of the aerials. After being defeated, there seem to be two creepy red dots {{font color|#880000|black|【{{color|#FF4444|・・}}】}} peeping out of the ground that look like eyes. This doesn't hurt the player. It bears a resemblance to a [[w:Nelumbo nucifera|Lotus Flower]].

{{nihongo|'''Bishamonten'''|毘沙門天}}, also known as '''Vaiśravaṇa''' or '''Jambhala''', is an actual [[god]] in [[Wikipedia:Buddhist mythology|Buddhist mythology]] with many depictions in different areas of Asia. He is the guardian of the northern direction, and his home is in the northern quadrant of the topmost tier of the lower half of Mount [[Wikipedia:Sumeru|Sumeru]]. He is the leader of all the [[Wikipedia:Yaksha|yakṣas]] who dwell on the Sumeru's slopes. In Japan he is thought of as an armor-clad god of warriors and warfare, and punisher of evildoers. Bishamonten is portrayed holding a spear in one hand and a small pagoda in the other hand, symbolizing the divine treasure house whose contents he both guards and gives away. In Japanese folklore, he is one of the [[wikipedia:Seven Gods of Fortune|Seven Gods of Fortune]]. He is a principal Deity of Shigisan Shingon Buddhism, one of the sect of [[w:Shingon Buddhism|Shingon Buddhism]] in Japan. 

==Background Information==
===Name===
The name ''Bishamonten'' ({{lang|ja|毘沙門天}}) is comprised of 毘沙門 ''bishamon'', an approximation of the original Sanskrit name (Vaiśravaṇ) and the suffix 天 ''ten'' meaning "heaven" or "god." He is also sometimes called ''Tamonten'' ({{lang|ja|多聞天}}), which means "listening to many teachings".

==Relationships==
;'''[[Byakuren Hijiri]]'''
Byakuren has long been devoted to Bishamonten and she decided to summon Bishamonten to her temple. However, he was very busy and, thus, never came. Byakuren realized that the youkai around her temple were fearful of Bishamonten, thinking that he would exterminate them. Bishamonten was around the temple most of the time, which made the youkai scared of going to the temple. 

;'''[[Shou Toramaru]]'''
Byakuren came up with a plan to introduce Shou, the most straightforward and honest youkai to Bishamonten on the mountain and in exchange, to gather faith. Bishamonten quietly took Shou as his disciple and avatar.

;'''[[Nazrin]]'''
As Bishamonten don't fully trust Shou, he assigned his helper Nazrin to watch on Shou. Despite Bishamonten's worries, Shou didn't cause any problems at all. 

==Additional Information==
*Bishamonten is said to have aided [[Toyosatomimi no Miko|Prince Shotoku]] against the Mononobe clan; it is unknown whether this is true in the Touhou canon.

Byakuren first appeared as the final [[boss]] of ''[[Undefined Fantastic Object]]'', later appearing as a playable character in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'' and ''[[Urban Legend in Limbo]]''. She was a target for [[Stage]] 12 of ''[[Double Spoiler]]'' and the Final Day of ''[[Impossible Spell Card]]''.

===Personality===
Byakuren is a monk who is kind to both [[human]]s and [[youkai]]. However, it is somewhat difficult for her to befriend humans because of these views, as well as the fact that she doesn't drink alcohol and is a vegetarian. She is mild-mannered and has never been seen to be overly angry. Youkai that don't desire conflict flock to her, while those that do are repulsed by her.

===Abilities===
;Magic
Byakuren was once a [[Houjutsu|Buddhist miracle-worker]], but after her brother's death turned to [[Youjutsu|youkai-derived magic]] to retain her youth. Though she is called a saint, these powers are ultimately demonic in nature. Her current specialty is magic that increases her physical abilities, including strength, speed, and sensory perception.  In ''Undefined Fantastic Object'', the spell card ''[[Undefined_Fantastic_Object/Spell_Cards/Stage_6#Spell_Card_96|Superhuman "Byakuren Hijiri"]]'' demonstrates these powers, increasing Byakuren's speed of movement so greatly that she can even outrun [[Reimu]]'s ''Fantasy Seal''. Likewise, the fighting games show an extensive use of these abilities in several of her attacks and spell cards.

===Occupation===
Byakuren is the chief priest at the [[Myouren Temple]], where her main goal is to bring peace to both [[human]]s and [[youkai]]. As the chief priest, she teaches the dharma to anyone willing to listen. She also manages funerals and the graveyard. Once a month, she performs an "overnight sutra-chanting live concert", where she sings a song in monotone while keeping rhythm with a [[Wikipedia:Wooden_fish|wooden fish]]. The event attracts both youkai and humans.

===Possessions===
;Sorcerer's Sutra Scroll
Created while Byakuren was in [[Makai]], the Sorcerer's Sutra Scroll is unique to her. The sutras Byakuren needs to use her power are written on them. It has an automatic mode, which will cause it to recite spells on its own. Compared to a regular paper scroll, the amount the Sorcerer's Sutra Scroll holds is limitless. It is also said that this scroll won't deteriorate over time. Lastly, because it has a "will" of its own, no one except for Byakuren can handle it.

;Vajra 
Byakuren wields Vajra that she could either use as a sword or throw it like Danmaku. 

;Motorcycle
During the events of ''Urban Legend in Limbo'', Byakuren gains a motorcycle as a result of the Urban Legend incident. She is mostly shown to ram her opponents with it, however, she can furthermore use it as a transportation device.

==Backstory==
Once a [[human]], Byakuren was a nun who worked with her younger brother, [[Myouren Hijiri]]. However, when her brother died, she began to fear death. This fear prompted her to search for some way to maintain her youth. Eventually she did find it; however, its origin was not in the Buddhist art she had dedicated her life to, but rather a kind of black magic.

No longer fully "human", she soon came to fear losing her power. Because of the nature of the world, the magic that she wielded would only be lost if humanity came to reject it as a whole; and because of that, she needed to ensure the prosperity and longevity of youkai. Thus, she came to honor and protect the [[youkai]] for her own benefit while simultaneously pretending to exterminate those youkai. People came to look up to her and the threat of youkai lessened. However, after some time, Byakuren started to realize the struggle youkai faced in her time. So rather than protecting them out of her own selfishness, she began to honestly consider the youkai as beings that needed to be helped.

At one time, Byakuren was sent to exterminate the [[phantom]] on the seas, [[Minamitsu Murasa]], who had gained much infamy for sinking ships. Rather than vanquish Murasa as she had been sent to do, Byakuren confronted the spirit as a normal human, and Murasa easily capsized her ship. However, Byakuren rose from the sea, riding atop a shining ship like the one Murasa had fallen from. By granting Murasa this ship, she freed the spirit from the cursed oceans and earned her gratitude.

At some point she also welcomed [[Ichirin Kumoi]] and her [[nyuudou]] companion [[Unzan]], gaining their trust as well. The two of them lived at her temple.

The temple that she lived in was in the mountains; a temple to the [[god]] [[Bishamonten]]. In order to gain the trust of the youkai living on the mountain, she decided to appoint a youkai to serve under the god. This youkai was [[Shou Toramaru]]. Shou excelled at her duties, and it is implied that in doing so, Byakuren came to be liked by the youkai living around the area.

Eventually, her desire to help youkai rather than exterminate them was exposed to humans such as with her encounter with Murasa. She was ostracized for being a "[[demon]] in human form", and eventually was sealed away into the depths of [[Makai]], forever locked in Hokkai.

==Background Information==
===Origin===
[[File:ThGKByakuren.png|thumb|right|200px|Byakuren, as she appears in ''[[Symposium of Post-mysticism‎]]''.]]
[[Myouren Hijiri]], Byakuren's younger brother, was a real Buddhist priest born in [[Wikipedia:Shinano Province|Shinano Province]], which is [[ZUN]]'s hometown, and trained at {{nihongo|Chougosonshi Temple|朝護孫子寺}} on {{nihongo|Mount Shigi|信貴山}}. He appears in several stories, but the most significant one is [[Wikipedia:Shigisan-engi|Shigisan Engi]], which is one of the most popular [[Wikipedia:Emakimono|emakimono]]. In its third volume, there is an unnamed Buddhist priestess who wants to meet Myouren, who is her younger brother. She is the inspiration for Byakuren. The priestess is looking for Myouren because she is worried about him not coming back, so she stays at [[Wikipedia:Tōdai-ji|Toudaiji]], where Myouren had made the vows for priesthood. [[Wikipedia:Daibutsu|Daibutsu]] tells her in a dream that there is a purple cloud over the side of the mountain southwest from where she is. She goes there the next morning, and finally she is able to meet and live together with him.

===Name===
{{nihongo|''Byakuren Hijiri''|聖　白蓮}} is her name. {{nihongo|''Hijiri''|聖}} can mean "Saint", "Virtuous [[Wikipedia:Bhikkhuni|Monk]]" or "Itinerant Monk" whilst {{nihongo|''Byakuren''|白蓮}} can mean "White Lotus" or "Purity". So it literally can be read as "Saint of the White Lotus" or "White Lotus Saint"; drawing upon the cultural reading of the white lotus as a symbol of purity – "Pure and Saintly" or "Saint of Purity". It may also be drawing upon the modern definition of {{nihongo||[[wikipedia:ja:聖|聖]]|Hijiri|meaning a world-trekking Buddhist monk}} – "Roaming Monk of the White Lotus" or "The Pure and Itinerant Monk".

===Design===
In ''[[Undefined Fantastic Object]]'''s official art, Byakuren has long, wavy, light brown hair that fades to purple at the top, with hazel or light brown eyes. She wears a black and white dress with long strips of black fabric going across the middle and white fabric across the arms. Along with this dress, she wears a long cape. She also holds a giant, magical scroll called the Sorcerer's Sutra Scroll. The gradient in her hair has been confirmed by [[ZUN]] to be a natural colour.&lt;ref&gt;Comment on [http://karen.saiin.net/~yamu/x/log0908.html Yamu's blog (NSFW)] on 2009/09/24 at 18 o'clock―{{lang|ja|俺的というか、神主的に髪の毛自体の色って言ってた。（夏コミ直後に話す機会があった時、真っ先に聞いたｗ）}} &lt;/ref&gt;

From ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'' onward, she wears a wide-brimmed hat and shiny green beads.

Occasionally, in ''[[Urban Legend in Limbo]]'' and ''[[Antimony of Common Flowers]]'' Byakuren donned a biker gear that consists of a latex bodysuit with a zipper in the chest that shares the same strips in the middle of her dress, a pair of high-heeled boots and a green neckerchief that replaces her green beads.

;''Undefined Fantastic Object''
[[File:Th12ByakurenSprite.png|frame|Byakuren's sprite in ''UFO'']]
In ''[[Undefined Fantastic Object]]'', she is unsealed thanks to the combined efforts of [[Shou Toramaru]]'s group of [[youkai]] and the heroine. Her fate depends on which heroine is chosen by the player, but in [[canon]], she settles down near the [[Human Village]] with the intentions of building a temple there. By [[Sanae Kochiya]]'s request – the shrine maiden had vouched for Byakuren's character – [[Kanako Yasaka]] and [[Suwako Moriya]] constructed it for her relatively quickly.

==Additional Information==
*Byakuren is a practitioner of [[w:Shingon Buddhism|Shingon Buddhism]] in her early life together with her brother.
*The silhouette of Byakuren occupies the front of ''[[Undefined Fantastic Object]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s jewel case.
*Byakuren was one of the candidates for the extra [[boss]] of ''[[Ten Desires]]'', along with [[Kasen Ibaraki]].
*Written in [[ZUN]]'s hand on her final cut-in is {{nihongo||南無三！|Namusan!}}, which is short for {{nihongo||南無三宝|Namu Sanbou}} - roughly, "Hail to the three treasures of Buddhism" (the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha). It's used to request salvation in a moment of danger. Byakuren also uses this term at the very end of her dialogue with the heroine.
*During her [[Undefined Fantastic Object/Spell Cards/Stage 6#Spell Card 90|second-to-last]] (fourth) [[spell card]] on Easy, the stars under the [[health bar]] show she has two lives left. She does, but only on higher difficulties.
**The same spell card looks like one of [[Shinki]]'s attack patterns.
*Byakuren's Lotus Butterfly seems to be a reference to [[YuugenMagan]]'s evil eyes. The two share a similar presentation and shoot similar danmaku patterns. This, of course, makes sense as Byakuren, like YuugenMagan, appears in [[Makai]].
*In ''[[Undefined Fantastic Object]]'', Byakuren has no hitbox after her third spell card. This is likely a [[glitch]].
*In ''[[Oriental Sacred Place]]'' chapter 12, Byakuren's hair is lighter on the top and gets darker towards the bottom.

Byakuren Hijiri

Species: magician&lt;br /&gt;
Ability: Using magic (specializing in magic that increases her physical abilities)


Byakuren's younger brother [[Myouren Hijiri|Myouren]] was a legendary monk. &lt;br/&gt;
With ease he could cure the illnesses of people in faraway places and send away a flying bowl to carry off the granaries of the miserly rich.

In her later years, Byakuren, studied [[Houjutsu|the way of the Dharma]] under her brother.&lt;/b&gt;
She normally lived on the Flying Storehouse, which was packed with Myouren's Dharmic power, and so naturally Byakuren gained power of her own.

But Myouren passed away before Byakuren,&lt;br /&gt;
and in her grief, Byakuren was filled with a terrible fear of death.&lt;br /&gt;
To save herself from dying, she learned the power of rejuvenation. But rather than the way of the Dharma, she got this power from ''[[youjutsu]]'', a kind of witchcraft.

Having made the gift of rejuvention her own, the undying woman next came to fear losing her power.

The only way her ''youjutsu'' could be lost was if humanity were to reject it entirely.&lt;br /&gt;
In other words, if youkai were to disappear, she would be unable to sustain her own power.&lt;br /&gt;
Byakuren respected the youkai.&lt;br /&gt;
On the surface she would accept requests to exterminate youkai, but underneath she would help those youkai. 

She respected the youkai, but not out of hostility toward humans.&lt;br /&gt;
At first was to serve her own desires, but as she learned of the of the youkai's pitiful past, she began to think she needed to do something to help them.


This youthful monk who'd suddenly appeared...&lt;br /&gt;
Her youth and her magic made her extremely popular among humans.&lt;br /&gt;
"With Byakuren here, we needn't fear the youkai anymore.
We needn't spend our nights in fear," they said.

And so the gap between her wishes and the expectations gave birth to a terrible tragedy.&lt;br /&gt;
"She's a demon in human guise!" they said.&lt;br /&gt;
She was sealed away in Makai, never to appear before humans again.

| translation ='''Acharya who Surpassed the Primates, Hijiri Byakuren'''

The Myouren Temple was bustling with people.&lt;br/&gt;
But their goal wasn't to receive the teachings of the Buddha.&lt;br/&gt;
They were those who strayed from morality, who stood out gaudily, causing a huge ruckus,&lt;br/&gt;
who were called "justice", in this world without rules.&lt;br/&gt;
Repeating "power is a means, not an end", she enters the gaudy battle.

'''Special skill: Lineage of the Superhuman'''

Before activating a special attack, Byakuren must first recite a chant.&lt;br/&gt;
When you input a special attack once, she performs a chant that charges the amount of times she can use it,&lt;br/&gt;
and inputting the same special attack again&lt;br/&gt;
consumes the charge and uses the special attack.&lt;br/&gt;
The number of charges for each special attack differs,&lt;br/&gt;
and if you want to use a different special attack, she must recite a new chant first.&lt;br/&gt;
In exchange for her chanting making special attacks hard to distinguish,&lt;br/&gt;
the special attacks themselves are more powerful.

'''Last Word: Atharsaveda'''

Byakuren charges forward and knocks her opponent back, and using concentrated laser fire&lt;br/&gt;
she performs a series of burning attacks.&lt;br/&gt;
Her high-speed charge grazes the opponent's bullets,&lt;br/&gt;
so she can catch opponents that are far away.&lt;br/&gt;
Possessing strong pressure and high enough power to break your spirit,&lt;br/&gt;
it is truly a show of the greatest superpower.

She has a system called ''Chanting'' which allows for a handicap in the application of the finishing move; in this game you can choose freely what finishing move to use as long as you have a chant, and chanting for a prolonged period of time opens up several new possibilities, such as the ability to stockpile them.

Her Occult Attack “Silver Sky-way” lets her rush freely through the sky.&lt;br /&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Chang'e'''|嫦娥|Jouga}} is a [[Lunarian]] and [[God|Goddess]] who drank the [[Hourai Elixir]], for which she was imprisoned on the [[Moon]] in the [[Lunar Capital]]. Like [[Eirin Yagokoro]], her real name is unknown and unpronounceable to earthlings.

==General Information==
Chang'e is an enigmatic character. Little is known about her except that she lived on the Moon and was mistress of the [[moon rabbit]]s before drinking the [[Hourai Elixir]] and becoming immortal, for which crime she was imprisoned for her now-eternal life. Today, the moon rabbits sing in unison when pounding mochi to atone for her sin of drinking the elixir.

It was unknown what happened to her until ''[[Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom]]'', when it was revealed that [[Junko]] and [[Hecatia Lapislazuli]] had a grudge towards her and that they intended on invading the [[Lunar Capital]] to reach her whilst she is still in prison.

==Background Information==
The ''Touhou'' character Chang'e is closely based on [[wikipedia:Chang'e|a lunar goddess of the same name]] in Chinese mythology. In most versions of her story, her husband Houyi acquires an elixir of immortality and comes home after an absence to discover that Chang'e has drunk it, after which she rises to the Moon. The circumstances of her drinking the elixir varies: in some versions, she drinks it to keep the gift of immortality from her despotic husband, whilst in others she is a selfish princess who drinks it because she herself seeks the power.

===Name===
''Chang'e'' is the Mandarin Chinese pronunciation of her name. According to the rules of ''[[wikipedia:pinyin|hanyu pinyin]]'' romanization, the apostrophe is inserted for disambiguity: ''Change'' could be mistakenly analyzed as ''Chan-ge''.

The Japanese reading of {{lang|ja|嫦娥}} is ''Jouga'', and this is the pronunciation used in ''Touhou Project''.  However, the English translations of ''[[Silent Sinner in Blue]]'' and later works have used the more widely known Mandarin rendering of her name to make the cultural reference less obscure. In particular, the real-life [[wikipedia:Chinese Lunar Exploration Program|Chinese Lunar Exploration Program]], in ''Touhou'' referred to as the "Second Lunar Invasion", is codenamed "the Chang'e Project".

The first character of her name, 嫦, can mean "lady of eternity", whilst the second, 娥,  means "beautiful/elegant".  The former character was once written as {{lang|zh|姮}}, but was altered to the then-homophonous {{lang|zh|嫦}} to avoid the radical {{lang|zh|亘}}, which occurred in the second character of the taboo personal name of [[Wikipedia:Emperor Wen of Han|Emperor Wen]] of the [[Wikipedia:Han_dynasty#Western_Han|Western Han Dynasty]], Liu Heng.

==Relationships==
===Houyi===
[[Wikipedia:Houyi|Houyi]] was Chang'e's husband, and also the one who killed Junko's son and shot down the suns, creating Junko and Hecatia's grudge. He was eventually killed by Junko. In Touhou, it is unknown which version of him exists: in one story, he is a loving husband who becomes helpless as Chang'e is forced to drink the elixir; in another, he is a despotic ruler who Chang'e is forced to stop by consuming the elixir in his place; in yet another, it is her to gives in to the elixir's temptation. They are sometimes known to represent the [[Wikipedia:Yin-Yang|yin and yang]].

===Moon rabbits===
Chang'e is the true master of all the [[moon rabbit]]s. They pound mochi to atone for their master's sin of drinking the [[Hourai Elixir]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Silent Sinner in Blue]]: Chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt; Although they are said to pound rice cakes, in reality they are attempting to create the Hourai Elixir.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cage in Lunatic Runagate]]: [[Cage in Lunatic Runagate/Sixth_Chapter|Sixth Chapter]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reisen Udongein Inaba]] also seems to serve under Chang'e as she refers to her as {{nihongo|"Lady Chang'e"|嫦娥様}}, but it's unknown if Chang'e particularly knows her.

===Junko &amp; Hecatia===
[[Junko]] has a grudge against Chang'e. This is because her husband, Houyi, killed Junko's son. 
[[Hecatia Lapislazuli]] hates Chang'e as well, because Houyi also shot down the suns taking away the light [[Hell]] needs to exist, as without strong light the darkness of Hell would also weaken. It is said that Hecatia's grudge against Chang'e is mainly due to Junko's influence. It is unknown to what extent Chang'e knows Junko, but she is at least aware of her existence.

The ''[[Touhou Project]]'' features a great number and variety of '''characters'''. Over the course of 30 games, literature, and music CDs, the cast has grown to having over 180 characters. [[Reimu Hakurei]] and [[Marisa Kirisame]] are considered the protagonists of the ''Touhou Project'', due to being the most frequent playable characters in the games. Others characters' roles in the games consist of supporting characters, [[boss]]es, or minor appearances. However, due to a diverging points in the series, some of the characters (namely, the majority of the [[PC-98]] ones) have not been mentioned again. 

==List of Characters==
===Touhou Project===
Here is a list of all ''Touhou Project'' characters, categorised by their first game or publication appearance ''(Characters with * after their name do not have an official name)''. NB, the "generations" (term unofficial) for the games are split according to [http://abload.de/img/bitsummit1z1qn8.jpg this image].

===Seihou Project &amp; Project Blank===
Here is a list of all ''[[Seihou Project]]'' and ''[[Project Blank]]'' characters by "[[Shunsatsu sare do?]]" and [[RebRank]] respectively, categorised by their first game or publication appearance. Note that they aren't Touhou characters, but Seihou did contain guest appearances by [[ZUN]] himself, and that Seihou characters aren't part of ''Project Blank'', but do officially contain Seihou characters.

==General Information==
With its focus on [[wikipedia:bishōjo|bishoujo]] characters, the Touhou series possesses a large cast compared to other [[shoot 'em up]] games, maybe even those of [[shooting game]]s, and are notoriously female. Most Touhou characters reside in a fictional landlocked region called [[Gensokyo]], where [[human]]s and [[youkai]] live. The youkai often prey on the humans while the humans try to exterminate them. A character's most common role in a ''[[Touhou Project]]'' game is being a [[boss]], and they have [[/Titles|titles]] and a theme song associated with them. Midbosses, however, tend to not have a unique theme. Many characters also have unique [[/Abilities|abilities]], and almost all [[Windows]] characters have at least one ability named in the fashion of {{nihongo|"capable of ~~"|~~程度の能力}}, showing their strength and power with various capabilities.

Though each game features a collection of different characters, the main character of the games is always [[Reimu Hakurei]], joined by [[Marisa Kirisame]]. The only games where this is not the case are ''[[Shoot the Bullet]]'' and ''[[Double Spoiler]]''; [[Aya Shameimaru]] is playable on both, and [[Hatate Himekaidou]] can become playable in the latter. The same thing applies in ''[[Fairy Wars]]'', ''[[Impossible Spell Card]]'', and ''[[Violet Detector]]'' which has [[Cirno]], [[Seija Kijin]], and [[Sumireko Usami]] as the sole playable character in their respective games.

===PC-98 Games===
[[File:Th03cover.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Cover of ''[[Phantasmagoria of Dim.Dream]]'', featuring [[PC-98]] characters that appear in the game.]]
As of ''[[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]]'', [[ZUN]] decided to develop games for the [[Windows]] platform and flesh out the universe starting from a clean slate. Besides the [[:Category:Returning PC-98 Characters|Returning characters from the PC-98]], none of the other characters from the PC-98 games have reappeared in the Windows era, although cases such as [[Mima]]'s appearance on the case of ''[[Akyu's Untouched Score vol.4]]'' exist.

PC-98 characters tend to have a title and music theme, but no ability has being explicitly stated to most characters. They also don't have articles and interviews, or other appearances in print works.

===Windows Games=== 
Another minor pivotal point exists with the release of ''[[Mountain of Faith]]'', marking the "2nd Windows generation". While previous games had independent storylines, the plots of ''Mountain of Faith'' up to ''[[Ten Desires]]'' were connected (e.g. The events of ''Ten Desires'' were triggered by the construction of the [[Myouren Temple]], which in turn was triggered by the Palanquin ship being released by the geyser by [[Utsuho Reiuji]]'s power.) However, ''[[Double Dealing Character]]'' contains no storyline related to the previous games, so it could mark another minor pivotal point for a possible "3rd Windows generation".

The character appearances trend also resets. For example, [[Sakuya Izayoi]] was a stage 5 boss in ''Embodiment of Scarlet Devil'' who later became playable in ''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]'' up to ''[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]'', but has not made an appearance after that in any danmaku Touhou game up until ''[[Double Dealing Character]]''.

*'''Fighting Games'''
A consistent cast can be seen in the fighting games. Rather than inventing a new set of characters, only one or two new characters were added with the rest coming from previous games. So far, only four characters have first appeared in a fighting game.

*'''Photography Games &amp; Puzzles'''
In ''[[Shoot the Bullet]]'', ''[[Double Spoiler]]'' and ''[[Impossible Spell Card]]'', characters from previous games are used. ''Shoot the Bullet'' contains most characters from ''Embodiment of Scarlet Devil'' to ''Phantasmagoria of Flower View'', while ''Double Spoiler'' adds the cast from ''Mountain of Faith'' up to ''[[Undefined Fantastic Object]]''. ''Impossible Spell Card'' contained a variety of characters, mostly from ''[[Ten Desires]]'' and ''[[Double Dealing Character]]''.

*'''Literature'''
The cast of Touhou characters also grows with the addition of the novels and comics. Only [[Aya Shameimaru]] and the [[Three Fairies Of Light]] were later featured in a game. Touhou literature is directly connected with the Windows games, as events that happen within the literature are mentioned in the Windows games, and vice versa. ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'' and ''[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]]'' and ''[[Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red]]'' have in-universe articles and interviews about individual characters, along with ''[[The Grimoire of Marisa]]'' having [[spell card]]s related to the characters.

===Seihou Games===
[[File:Kioh Gyoku.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Cover of ''[[Kioh Gyoku]]'', featuring Seihou characters that appear in the game.]]
{{seihou note|section}}
Characters of the ''[[Seihou Project]]'' were created by "[[Shunsatsu sare do?]]" and have nothing to do with the ''[[Touhou Project]]'', although they also do have their own theme music. The ''Seihou Project'' however contained characters from the ''Touhou Project'', named [[Reimu Hakurei]], [[Marisa Kirisame]] and [[Yuuka Kazami]]. Even in Touhou, references to Seihou characters are extremely rare, with one coming from ''[[Dolls in Pseudo Paradise]]''.

It appears that each game contains most characters from the previous. Unlike Touhou characters, Seihou characters are designed to be very Western, which is the opposite of Touhou; even their names are western. They also have more frequent male characters that appear in the [[shoot 'em up]]s. Since Seihou is set in the future, the characters are also designed to have a futuristic feeling with then, along with having their own aircraft. However, unlike Touhou characters, most character don't have any [[/Titles|titles]] or [[/Abilities|abilities]] associated with them and most characters' species are [[human]].

==Character Designs==
[[File:Th14RaikoIntroduction.png|thumb|right|275px|An example of in-game introduction to a character's name (namely [[Raiko Horikawa]]): top, title; middle, character's name in Japanese; bottom, the romaji of the name in Japanese naming order.]]
===Names===
Generally, almost all names for each character are written in the Japanese script, either in [[wikipedia:Hiragana|hiragana]], [[wikipedia:Katakana|katakana]] or [[wikipedia:Kanji|kanji]]. Names generally start with [[wikipedia:Japanese name|the surname followed by the first name]], but when they are written in katakana to show a western name, they'll be in western naming order, where they'll have a middle dot ({{lang|ja|・}}) to show where the surname begins. The names may not truly be actual names in real life, as they may contain kanji to represent the character overall, for example {{nihongo||幽々子|Yuyuko}} literally translates to "ghostly child".

[[ZUN]] has provided [[wikipedia:Romanization of Japanese|romaji]] and [[wikipedia:Kana|kana]] versions for most of the [[Windows]] characters; the latter only included if the name's in kanji. On some rare occurrences, he'd include official English translations of the name. There have been instances in error of romaji however, such as those listed [[/Spelling discrepancies|here]]. Some characters only have one name, notably the [[PC-98]] characters, such as [[Rika]] and [[Shinki]]. There are even those that have no name, such as [[Tokiko]].

For western languages, such as English or French, names are obviously written in the [[wikipedia:Latin alphabets|Latin script]], called ''[[wikipedia:Romanization|romanization/romanisation]]''. Also, the naming order from Japanese is switched to fit suitably with Westerners, for example {{nihongo|"Saigyouji Yuyuko"|西行寺　幽々子}} becomes "[[Yuyuko Saigyouji]]". Unofficial romaji may be used for convenience; for example, "Byakuren Hiziri" was officially used, but "[[Byakuren Hijiri]]" has not being officially used yet. Choices and alternative spelling can come in many when romanising katakana; one example is [[Maribel Hearn]], who [[ZUN]] doesn't even know the official translation&lt;ref name="ZUN's AWA"&gt;[[ZUN's AWA Q&amp;A Panel]]&lt;/ref&gt; and has other possible translations such as "Maribel Han" and "Mæriberie Hearn".

Eastern languages, namely Chinese and Korean, also have some forms of conversions. Chinese conversion from kanji to [[wikipedia:Chinese characters|hanzi]] depends on the variant of the Chinese language whether it accepts the hanzi/kanji or not; they can sometimes keep their original kanji, but must always be transliterated from hiragana or katakana. Names are always transliterated to [[wikipedia:Hangul|hangeul]] within the Korean language. In cases like Yuyuko's name, since the Japanese iteration mark "{{lang|ja|[[wiktionary:々|々]]}}", casually called a {{nihongo||ノマ|noma}}, isn't formally used in the Chinese or Korean language, it's best to re-use the previous hanzi/hangeul (e.g. {{lang|zh|幽幽子}}/{{lang|ko|유유코}}).

Fans of both of the western and eastern fanbase have given alternative fan-names for the characters based on their characteristics, such as the [[Five Magic Stones]].

===Designs===
Despite there being many species of [[youkai]], almost all the characters take a [[humanoid]] form, and are notoriously female. Their designs are notoriously colourful and are based around their characteristics, culture and appearance in a game or manga. It's also notorious that almost all characters have some kind of head wear, such as ribbons or non-human attributes, and that they tend to have a skirt. For characters to not have these attributes is somewhat rare, such as [[Yuuka Kazami]] not having a hat and [[Fujiwara no Mokou]] wearing trousers respectively.

The designs are based on the species a certain character is, such as [[Nitori Kawashiro]] being a [[kappa]] and having a backpack to represent a tortoise's shell, and [[Raiko Horikawa]] having a drum since she is a [[tsukumogami]]. This also relates to animal-based characters, such as [[Chen]] having cat ears, [[Ran Yakumo]] having nine tails due to being a [[Kitsune]] and [[Mamizou Futatsuiwa]] having a large tail due to being a [[bake-danuki]].

Some characters however have not even been given an official portrait, such as [[Layla Prismriver]] and [[Youki Konpaku]]. This leads to fans theorising their appearances.

;Male characters
It's seldom to see [[:Category:Males|male characters]] appear in the ''[[Touhou Project]]'' as they are either not named (Various [[human]]s shown in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]''), not [[humanoid]] ([[Genjii]], [[Sokrates]], [[Unzan]]) or do not have official appearances ([[Youki Konpaku]], [[Marisa's unnamed father]], [[Myouren Hijiri]]). However, the one with the most recurring appearances is [[Rinnosuke Morichika]], who is sometimes mocked in the fanbase over this. Another male character with a name and an official appearance is [[Unshou]]. There is also one before all of these, called [[Shingyoku]], but this character has three forms, so this character may not exactly be male.

However, it has been theorised that [[ZUN]] might've had trouble designing male characters due to the number of female characters – such as statements like "it would be weird to have an old man as the last boss in Touhou" for Myouren been originally the final boss of ''[[Undefined Fantastic Object]]'' – but later confirmed that he feels that "boys get in the way of the game" and that "boys would just ruin the balance of the series."&lt;ref name="ZUN's AWA" /&gt; He prefers females to fight in the games.

;PC-98
Amongst the [[PC-98]], only some characters had a full portrait of themselves from head to feet. The PC-98 had a 16-colour limit, where one obvious feature was that most PC-98 characters had the same eye and hair colour; the only characters who have different eye and hair colour are [[Elis]], [[Konngara]] and [[SinGyoku]]'s "male" form. Also, [[ZUN]] has stated that he won't go back to doing 16-colour graphics.&lt;ref name="AUS3comment"&gt;[[Akyu's Untouched Score vol.3]]: [[Akyu's Untouched Score vol.3/ZUN's Comments|Comments]]&lt;/ref&gt;

;Drawings
[[File:ThGK Interview.png|thumb|right|175px|Some characters that don't appear in ''[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]]'' (with [[ZUN]]) by [[TOKIAME]].]]
[[ZUN]] takes on most of the drawings for the characters that appear in the Touhou games. His distinctive ways of drawing is different compared to other artists. The character portraits used in the fighting spin-off games developed in collaboration with [[Twilight Frontier]], however, have been drawn by [[alphes]] (''[[Immaterial and Missing Power]]'', ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]'', ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]'' and ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]''), and [[Moe Harukawa]]  (''[[Urban Legend in Limbo]]'' and ''[[Antinomy of Common Flowers]]''). ZUN had various artists to draw the manga and other official books, such as [[Aki★Eda]] for ''[[Silent Sinner in Blue]]'', and several artists in the case of ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]''. [[Makoto Hirasaka]] drew the ''[[Touhou Sangetsusei]]'' mangas, but also drew the characters for ''[[Fairy Wars]]'' since the game is based on the manga.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="40331">This is a list of abilities given to each character from the [[Windows]] era of the ''[[Touhou Project]]''.

==The meaning of "{{lang|ja|程度の能力}}"==
In official works, abilities are described with a phrase which translates roughly as {{nihongo|"capable of"|程度の能力|Teido no nouryoku}}. Seen in almost every character profile, this phrase has become a trademark of [[ZUN]] and the Touhou series in general; the number of abilities which leave it out (such as [[Eirin]]'s "natural genius") are rare. As such, it is commonly used in fanworks to describe new abilities as well.

"程度の能力" appears to show the degree, extent, or order of magnitude of the strength of the abilities a character possesses in general, but not much more is known about the meaning of the phrase. Although ZUN could have simply chosen to phrase their abilities as "ability to ~," ({{lang|ja|～する能力}}), his choice of the unclearer "capable of ~" might be a way to add ambiguity in its meaning, as he has once said in an interview that he dislikes having everything too definite. Some of this ambiguity can be seen in characters such as [[Kogasa Tatara]] (who finds it hard to surprise humans despite that being her explicit ability) and [[Reisen Udongein Inaba]] (whose ability is far broader in scope than its name suggests).

Note, however, that ability descriptions are taken from the attached text files and sources such as ''[[Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red]]'' and ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]''; the characters themselves almost never announce them in this manner. In ''[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]]'', it is mentioned in [[Kanako Yasaka]] and [[Mononobe no Futo]]'s profiles that abilities are self-proclaimed.

The former ability is quoted from Toyohime's monologue, and the latter one is ZUN's talk. Restrictly to say, both of them shouldn't have been taken as the official ones — even if we can see it halfly official from the shortage of her other ability name — because they aren't in the official format "{{lang|ja|する程度の能力}}". But in "Touhou Characters Database ver 1.50810", her ability was listed in the profile as "ability to connect sea and mountain". Another case in [[Who's Who of Humans &amp; Youkai - Dusk Edition]], it was listed as "ability to connect mountain and sea". If we look up to this data, the latter one gets official.]

Not saying about "{{lang|ja|……する程度の能力}}". This ability name might be created from a sentence on the main text of that work, which is proved from the fact that [http://thwiki.info Japanese Touhou Wiki] lists her ability as "Ability to call over divine spirits" ({{lang|ja|神霊を呼ぶ程度の能力}}) quite refered by easy quoters in numerous sites, then this imperfect ability name is so often taken as *the* only official one. &lt;br /&gt;By the way, in "Touhou Characters Database ver 1.50810", it listed blank space about her ability in the profile, even though the ability of her elder sister's was included in the profile to be the official one. And in "Touhou Electronic Play", a would-be official ability was listed to be halfly official.  If we look up to this data, this ability got official.]

Next n the mook "Touhou Electronic Play", the brief explanation says that her ability is still unknown. Besides, it could be significant that the form of the ability (michibiku nouryoku) isn't inconsistent with that of the official one "...michibiku &lt;i&gt;teido no&lt;/i&gt; nouryoku". And finally in the mook "Who's Who of Human and Youkai: Everlasting Edition", her ability was listed in the official format "...michibiku &lt;i&gt;teido no&lt;/i&gt; nouryoku".]

Unchecked:

  Eastern and Little Nature Deity
    all spellings that weren't revised

 if they're different from EaLND:

==Name order==
Depending on the source, the names are either ''given name - family name'' or ''family name - given name''. For the later it usually uses the same order as it is written in Japanese, explaining cases like [[Alice Margatroid]] in ''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]'', or ''[[Fujiwara no Mokou]]'' in ''[[Imperishable Night]]''.

{{note|swr}} In ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]'' names are arranged basically as &lt;b&gt;given name — family name&lt;/b&gt; except Tenshi: "Hinanai Tenshi".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="73363">This is a list of titles given to each character from each of their official profiles. Each title says something about the character it's been given to, even if some are rather ambiguous. The works each title has appeared in are listed in brackets next to the title. The titles are ordered according to the works' internal chronological order; for example, ''[[Imperishable Night]]'' follows ''[[Immaterial and Missing Power]]''.

Some characters have multiple titles which may change from one game appearance to the next, and also have several titles within a single game. The characters that appear in Match Mode but not Story Mode of ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]'' are excluded from the below chart, because they only appear if ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]'' is installed and take their titles from that game.

There appears to be characters from certain games and manga that have a similarity to the rest of the characters titles. Here are a few examples:
*Titles from ''[[Shoot the Bullet]]'' and ''[[Double Spoiler]]'' are named jokingly or pejoratively by [[Aya Shameimaru|Aya]].
*Titles from ''Scarlet Weather Rhapsody'''s story mode are in the form of "''Species/Occupation/Symbol'' of ''Weather''", except for the new characters [[Iku Nagae]] and [[Tenshi Hinanawi]].
*Titles from ''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'' are in the form of "''Species'' of ''[[Wikipedia:Yojijukugo|Four Kanji Idiom]]''".
*Titles from ''[[Forbidden Scrollery]]'' use English (in katakana) for the ''Species/Occupation''.
*Titles from ''[[Ten Desires]]'' are in the form of "''Species/Occupation'' of ''XX'' Desire" ({{lang|ja|''××''欲の''○○''}}).
*Titles from ''[[Antinomy of Common Flowers]]'' are mainly in the form of "''XX'' and ''YY'' ''Species/Occupation''" ({{lang|ja|''xx''で''yy''の''○○''}}). Most possible pairs of characters are dubbed "''XX'' and ''YY'' Duo" on the select screen ({{lang|ja|''xx''で''yy''の二人}}), taking one half from each partner's title. Exceptions are pairs involving Doremy (simply 'Dream-Bestowing Duo' / {{lang|ja|夢を見せる二人}}), the Yorigami sisters ('Duo' becomes 'Trio' / {{lang|ja|三人}}, ''YY'' becomes 'Misfortune-Spreading' / {{lang|ja|不幸をもたらす}}) or Ichirin ('Trio,' or when paired with the Yorigamis, 'Quartet' / {{lang|ja|四人}}).
*Titles from ''[[Lotus Eaters]]'' relate in some way to alcohol. 

'''It should be noted that not all characters have an official profile to have received a title from.'''

''("Big Wheel" ({{lang|ja|大輪}}) is a literal translation of either "largely blooming" or "a large flower", relating to the fact that "ichirin" is normally means "single flower" in Japanese as the unit of counting flowers. That helps explain the connection to the team's DS title.)''&lt;br /&gt;
''(The DS title has a possible double meaning, as it can also be read as "The Flower and Old Man that Bloom in the Sky", since the participle or modifier in Japanese can apply to multiple nouns. ZUN probably made this rather amusing implication deliberately.)''&lt;br /&gt;
''(Some people interpret her title of UFO showing Ichirin's origin — look at the word "{{lang|ja|大輪}}". When it loses "{{lang|ja|人}} (human) from "{{lang|ja|大}}", it becomes "{{lang|ja|一輪}}" (Ichirin): '''{{lang|ja|大輪}} − {{lang|ja|人}} = {{lang|ja|一輪}}'''.

''(The DS title is a parody of the "Tactics" setting in the Japanese version of Dragon Warrior IV that tells all CPU players to put priority into attacking enemies, "Let's beat 'em up." ({{lang|ja|がんがんいこうぜ}}, gan-gan ikou ze))''&lt;br&gt;
''(The WaHH 35th title has the Buddhist term {{nihongo|[[Wikipedia:Samadhi|samādhi]]|三昧|zanmai}}. In this usage, however, it isn't used in original Buddhism terminology, but in vulgar, derivational meaning; "to engage in, indulge in sth. (especially too luxurious or unproductive debauchery, like gastronomy, sexual intercourse, maniac collection, etc.)". Then that might be literally "Great Buddhist Prayer Reaching to Perfect Praying", but it should be normally read as "Great Buddhist Prayer Indulging Deeply to Praying".)''&lt;br&gt;
''(In the LE 16th title, "abstaining from drink" derives from one of the [[Wikipedia:Five_precepts#Fifth_precept|Five Precepts]] of Buddhist moral disciplines broadly shared with by many Buddhists.)''

{{nihongo|'''Chen'''|橙}} is [[Ran Yakumo]]'s [[shikigami]], who was guarding the village of [[Mayohiga]] during the events of ''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]''. Unfortunately, she could put up little resistance due to being far away from her master.

==General Information==
[[File:Th105Chen.png|thumb|left|Chen in ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]'']]
Chen first appeared as the second [[stage]] midboss and [[boss]] of ''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]'', along with being the extra stage midboss and [[Ran Yakumo]]'s familiar in one of her [[spell card]]s. She was also [[Yukari Yakumo]]'s familiar in ''[[Immaterial and Missing Power]]'', ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]'', and ''[[Antinomy of Common Flowers]]'', and was a target on Stage 6 of ''[[Shoot the Bullet]]''. Additionally, she made a background appearance in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]''.

She is a [[bakeneko]] [[youkai]] that Ran Yakumo uses as [[shikigami]], but since Ran herself is Yukari's shikigami, she is a "shikigami of a shikigami". When possessed as a shikigami, Chen aquires the fearsome power of a [[kishin]], but since her master is also a shikigami, her ability is fairly low.&lt;ref name="PCB profile"&gt;[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]] - Chen's profile&lt;/ref&gt; The possession is removed when she is soaked in water, and since she also hates water as a cat, she is in any case weak to water. Her height is "low"&lt;ref name="mail"&gt;[[ZUN's E-mails]]&lt;/ref&gt; and is capable of [[human]] speech. She can use impressive black arts, but only possesses the intellect of a human child. Whether she is possessed or not, her personality and appearance don't change.&lt;ref name="PCB profile" /&gt;

She ordinarily lives on [[Youkai Mountain]].&lt;ref name="PMiSSChen"&gt;[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]: [[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Chen|Chen]]&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red]]'', she made the village of cats and tried to stand as the leader, but the progress has been unfavorable.

===Abilities===
The way her abilities show up in the game itself is that she runs around the screen so freely in a way that is not expected of a boss of a shooting game, which is characteristic of her (as one would expect of a cat). This could be considered cute if she were an ordinary cat, but it also makes her slightly more tricky to deal with due to her speed and deceptive movement, which can confuse her opponent. Another characteristic of her is how she spins around and around while attacking, somewhat like her master.

;Use of sorcery (while possessed as shikigami)
In shikigami state, Chen becomes extremely dangerous and is able to use various kinds of sorcery. She uses techniques that focus on speed and precise, tricky movements to confuse her opponents, making it very similar to sleight of hand. For example, she could make it appear as if she is dashing to the left, but will then  attack from the right instead, moving so quickly that to humans it appears like instant teleportation.&lt;ref name="PMiSSChen" /&gt;

;Surprising people (as bakeneko)
When she becomes a regular [[bakeneko]], she becomes more feral and will resort to more physical attacks like biting and clawing with her long nails. Rather than saying she possesses a special ability to surprise accompanying humans, it is more strongly an implication that she's not able to do anything other than things of this extent. (However, even so, for ordinary humans it is dangerous enough). This is the same ability that [[Kogasa Tatara]] has - thus in this aspect, they have mutuality.

===Occupation===
Chen serves as a [[shikigami]] to [[Ran Yakumo]], and becomes much stronger when her master is present. However, she hates water, and splashing her will dispel the shikigami possession, making her resort to physical attacks. She is also very fond of catnip, and will lose the will to fight if some is scattered to distract her.

==Character Design==
[[File:PMiSS chen.jpg|thumb|120px|Chen as seen in ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'']]
===Name===
Her full name is {{nihongo|''Chen''|橙}}. The kanji in her name can be literally translated as the color "bitter orange" in the Japanese Language, or simply "orange" in Chinese. All of the Yakumo family are named after the names of color. Why Chen appears before Ran and [[Yukari]] comes from the fact that the orange light has physically lower energy than the indigo, Ran, and the violet, Yukari. The pronunciation of her name "Chen" is an obsolete Chinese reading of {{lang|zh|橙}}. In Japanese, the character would be read as "tou" or "daidai"; in Mandarin, "chéng".

===Design===
In her first appearance, Chen has dark brown eyes, brown hair and wears a green mob cap. She has black cat ears, with a gold earring in the left one, and two tails. Her dress is red with a white bow on the collar, with gold trimming and light pink frills at the bottom. The dress has light pink sleeves. She wears socks and has long hot pink fingernails.

==Appearances==
{{stub|section}}
;''Perfect Cherry Blossom''
[[File:Th07ChenSprite.png|frame|Chen's sprite in ''PCB'']]
Chen first appears in the second stage guarding the village of [[Mayohiga]], but she is promptly defeated by the heroine. Later in the extra stage, she guards the path to Ran Yakumo, and is much more powerful due to her master's proximity, but was again defeated.

===Spin-offs===
;Fighters
Chen appeared in ''[[Immaterial and Missing Power]]'', ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]'', and ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]'' as a projectile in Yukari's [[spell card]] ''Shikigami "Chen"''. In [[Antinomy of Common Flowers]] she gets used in the same way, this time in a combined move with her master [[Ran Yakumo]].

;''Shoot the Bullet''
[[File:Th135Chen.png|frame|Chen in ''HM'']]
In ''[[Shoot the Bullet]]'', [[Aya Shameimaru]] encountered Chen on [[stage]] 6 and took photos of her [[danmaku]].

;''Hopeless Masquerade''
Chen made a background cameo appearance in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'' on the [[Hakurei Shrine]] stage. She is seen standing with [[Ran Yakumo]] cheering (as a little animation).

===Literature===
;''Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red''
:{{Main|Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red/Chen|l1=Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red Article and Interview: Chen}}
Aya investigates an abandoned village inhabited entirely by cats. When she arrives, she finds Chen and cat anarchy. Chen explains that she gathered the cats there in search of a servant to call her own.

By the time Aya returns for an interview, Chen still has not managed to establish a solid leadership role for herself. Aya tells her that she lacks power and that she should reflect on the nature of the relationship between her and her master Ran. She recommends using a mouse (which Chen objects to).

'''Black Cat of Bad Omens'''

'''Chen'''

Stage 2 Boss, a bakeneko living in a mountain possessed as a [[shikigami]]. She possesses the ability to handle sorcery.

Her true form is Ran's shikigami, which makes her a shikigami of a shikigami of a [[youkai]]. Although she's a shikigami, her normal form is not always in a form of a charm, she can remains in her human-like form in normal situation so it won't be bothersome to classify her types. Even without being in shikigami possession she can speak the human language and fly around, but she would merely have the ability to the extent of surprising people. Also, while not being possessed, neither her appearance nor personality changes, but she still curls up by a [[wikipedia:Kotatsu|kotatsu]] in the winter.

Bakeneko acquire fearsome power when possessed by a [[kishin]], but since Chen's user is also a [[shikigami]], her ability is fairly low.

Getting touched by water dispels her shikigami possession. As a bakeneko her normal form also hates water, so she is always weak against water.

Her master is in the vicinity this time around, so her power has been amplified considerably. Would that power work on the [[human]] before her?

{{nihongo|'''Chimata Tenkyuu'''|天弓　千亦|Tenkyuu Chimata}} is the Stage 6 [[Boss|boss]] and secondary antagonist of ''[[Unconnected Marketeers]]''.
==General Information==

===Personality===
In ''Unconnected Marketeers'', Chimata appears to be polite but somewhat full of herself and dramatic, making bold claims such as humanity being "unable to survive" without her,  &lt;ref&gt; ''[[Unconnected Marketeers]]'' - ''”Put another way, you're essentially alive right now because of me”'' &lt;/ref&gt; and immediately jumping to the conclusion that those who don't wish to trade must be criminals of some kind.

She seems to be singularly concerned with the rules and regulations governing marketplaces, and is highly irritated when they are broken. She accuses the protagonist of wanting to steal and monopolize the cards after she refuses to trade with her,&lt;ref&gt; ''[[Unconnected Marketeers]]''  - ''“I see… You're trying to monopolize the cards with no exchange of currency.  So, you were a robber seeking to destroy the marketplace? I certainly can't let that slide. “'' &lt;/ref&gt;  and detests those that place the pursuit of profit over the rituals and regulations she favours.

===Abilities===
;Capable of letting one relinquish ownership

Chimata's ability is to allow others to relinquish ownership of an item. Without this ritual, a given object remains connected to the original owner, such is the case when someone loses, throws away, or gives away something. Only in a barter where both participants are willing to engage in an exchange of equitable value does a proper transfer of rights take place.

As her power is directly tied to the existence of physical marketplaces, it has been steadily diminishing due to the emergence of things like online trade in the [[Outside World]], which prompted Chimata to find a way to establish her own marketplace in Gensokyo.

In ''Unconnected Marketeers'', [[Megumu Iizunamaru]] abuses this ability to successfully transfer the special abilities of the residents of Gensokyo into Ability Cards, granting the wielder the powers of those depicted in the cards. &lt;ref&gt; ''[[Unconnected Marketeers]]'' - Chimata's Profile &lt;/ref&gt; While this did help Chimata recover her strength, it also served to concentrate power and wealth into the hands of the [[tengu]].

==Character Design==
===Origin===
Chimata may be based on {{nihongo|''ichigami''|市神}}, or the ''gods of marketplaces'' in Japanese folklore. Rather than gods of money or economics, they were more akin to gods of physical marketplaces, or barter and trade. Ichigami were worshipped as the gods who protect the commercial activities and security of marketplaces. When traditional marketplaces went into decline in modern-day Japan, belief in ichigami also declined.

Specifically, she is the god of "special event" marketplaces (as opposed to something like a regular farmer's market), which in ''Unconnected Marketeers'' is signified by the [[Wikipedia:Moonbow|lunar rainbow]]. Because of this, she may also be based on a long-forgotten medieval Japanese custom of holding markets when there's a rainbow. It was believed that the boundary between the human world and the world of Gods is beneath rainbows, so holding a market during a rainbow would please the Gods, because they temporarily receive everything that is being sold there.

===Name===
Her family name, {{nihongo|Tenkyuu|天弓}}, is written with characters meaning "heaven" and "bow" (as in "bow and arrow"). It is written the same way as a literary and dialectal Chinese word for "rainbow".

Her given name, {{nihongo|Chimata|千亦}}, is written with characters meaning "thousand" and "again". "Chimata" can also be written as {{lang|ja|巷}}, which means "the public", "streets" or "crossroads". It was likely chosen due to her status as a god of markets, which are public places where all sorts of people gather.

===Design===
Chimata's design very closely reflects her lunar rainbow powers, with her dress appearing to be a patchwork of multicoloured fabrics held together with golden buckles and zippers, resembling modernist [[Wikipedia:Stained glass|stained glass]], magenta boots with white bows, and the headband in her hair glowing with bright rainbow colours. She also wears a long white cape, white on one side, and a bright blue sky with scattered clouds on its inner lining. On her belt, she carries a coin purse.

==Appearances==
===Games===
[[File:Th18ChimataSprite.png|frame|right|Chimata's sprite in ''[[Unconnected Marketeers|UM]]'']]
;''Unconnected Marketeers''
As an ichigami, Chimata is sustained by faith like any other type of god. The mere act of buying or selling does not generate faith for her; it has to be a ritualized exchange which honors the traditions of Japanese temporary special marketplaces. The lack of such events and the subsequent loss of faith greatly weakened Chimata.

Therefore, she accepted The Great Tengu [[Megumu Iizunamaru]]'s offer to open a special event marketplace under the lunar rainbow. Using materials unearthed by [[Momoyo Himemushi]] that could mimic the abilities of others, Ability Cards were created that could be exchanged for currency under Megumu. The tengu would collect the profits, and the special marketplaces and ritualized exchange of cards would generate faith for Chimata. These rituals include special rules, which are why the protagonist can only buy one card per boss during [[Unconnected Marketeers]], and why [[Mike Goutokuji]] refuses to give up all of her cards even when threatened.

However, a rift developed between the two. Megumu wanted to maximize profits, and viewed Chimata's rules as an impediment. For Chimata, these faith-generating traditions were non-negotiable. Thus, by the time of [[Unconnected Marketeers]], the two are each planning to betray each other.

==Relationships==
;[[Megumu Iizunamaru]]
Megumu was Chimata's would-be business partner in the creation of the Ability Card marketplace. Their relationship had always been strained, as Megumu had sought to only use Chimata's powers to further the interests of tengu society, and had dissolved into outright hostilities by the end of the Ability Card Incident.

;[[Tsukasa Kudamaki]]
Tsukasa is seemingly subordinate to Chimata, with Tsukasa addressing her politely. Tsukasa reports Megumu's betrayal to Chimata, but it appears likely that Tsukasa was [[Wikipedia:double agent|playing both sides]]. Chimata seems to be somewhat aware of this, rudely dismissing Tsukasa from her service when she comes to realize Tsukasa's true motivations.

===Minor Relationships===
;[[Momoyo Himemushi]]
The two were also partners, although not much is known about their relationship. Since Momoyo and Megumu Iizunamaru are friends and neither Chimata nor Momoyo mention the other, they don't seem to be close and may have a similarly strained relationship.

==Additional Information==
* Her pose in ''[[Unconnected Marketeers]]'' suggests a dollar sign, with her arms creating the S shape and her fingers approximating the vertical stroke.
* Her silhouette can be seen on the cover of the game. Interestingly, there she holds her right hand clenched as a fist, while in the game she points upwards with her index finger.
* Chimata's dialogue seems to refer the economic concept of the "Invisible Hand" introduced by Adam Smith.

　　人間にとって、物を手放すことは難しい。&lt;br&gt;
　　誰かにあげたとしても、その人からの頂き物という情報が残り続ける。&lt;br&gt;
　　ゴミ箱に捨てたとしても、山に不法投棄したとしても、誰が捨てたという情報が残り続ける。&lt;br&gt;
　　所有権を失うことは容易ではないのだ。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

　　しかし完全にそれが行える場所がある。&lt;br&gt;
　　人が唯一物を交換できる場所、それが市場だ。&lt;br&gt;
　　市場で売る事によって、完全に所有権を失うことが出来る。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

　　彼女はそれを司る神様である。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

　　最近は市場を介さないで物の売買を行う事が増え、結果所有権が氾濫している事を嘆いていた。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

　　飯綱丸から市場を開いて欲しいと持ちかけられたとき、このチャンスを逃す物かと、&lt;br&gt;
　　本来の市場のように、厳しい条件を付けて売買するのなら協力すると答えた。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

　　彼女は飯綱丸のビジネスに利用されている事ぐらい重々承知の上だった。&lt;br&gt;
　　ビジネスが成功する頃には、神様としての力も取り戻し、大天狗ごとき恐れるに足らずだと&lt;br&gt;
　　思っていたからである。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;


　　最初の市場は、月に虹が架かったとき、山の頂上で開かれた。&lt;br&gt;
　　参加者は千亦、飯綱丸、管狐の典、大ムカデの百々世だけだった。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

　　初めての市場では、自らの能力を封じ込めたカードを売買した。&lt;br&gt;

　　目論見通り、カードに込められた複製の能力は、複製元の所有者から&lt;br&gt;
　　完全に切り離されて新たな所有者の能力の一部となった。&lt;br&gt;
　　その結果に、飯綱丸も百々世も大興奮したのである。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

　　その後は幾度となく市場が開かれ、山を中心にカードは広く流通した。&lt;br&gt;
　　カードの能力を使うには、ルールに則って購入しなければいけない。&lt;br&gt;

God of the Unowned&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Chimata Tenkyuu&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Species: God&lt;br&gt;
Ability: Capable of letting one relinquish ownership&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

For humans, letting go of things is difficult.&lt;br&gt;
Even if you give it to someone, the information that it was a gift from you will remain.&lt;br&gt;
Even if you throw it in the trash, or illegally dump it on a mountain, the information that someone left it there will remain.&lt;br&gt;
Relinquishing ownership is no easy feat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

However, there exists a place where that act can be perfectly carried out.&lt;br&gt;
The one place where people can exchange objects: the market.&lt;br&gt;
By selling something at a market, you can completely give up possession of it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

She's a god who governs that act.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

These days, the buying and selling of things has come to occur without a market's involvement much more often, and as a result, there is an utter glut of ownership rights. She lamented this fact.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

When [[Megumu Iizunamaru|Iizunamaru]] came to her and asked her to open a marketplace, she knew there was no way she'd let this chance slip by.&lt;br&gt;
She replied that she'd cooperate with her if, and only if, the transactions took place under strict conditions, like those of the original marketplaces.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

She understood full well that Iizunamaru was taking advantage of her for a business endeavor.&lt;br&gt;
She was fine with this, because she thought that once the endeavor succeeded, she'd have already regained her power as a god and would have nothing to fear from a mere Great Tengu.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The first market was held on the mountain's peak, as a rainbow encircled the moon.&lt;br&gt;
The only participants were Chimata, Iizunamaru, [[Tsukasa Kudamaki|Tsukasa]]  the ''kuda-gitsune'', and [[Momoyo Himemushi|Momoyo]] the ''oomukade''.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

In that first market, they bought and sold cards with their own abilities sealed inside.&lt;br&gt;
Beneath the lunar rainbow, the four of them exchanged cards back and forth.&lt;br&gt;
Just as they'd planned, the replica abilities sealed in the cards completely detached&lt;br&gt;
from their original owners, and became part of their new owners' abilities.&lt;br&gt;
Both Iizunamaru and Momoyo were greatly excited by this result.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Many more markets were held after that, and the cards spread far and wide out from the mountain.&lt;br&gt;
In order to use the cards' abilities, they had to be purchased according to the rules.&lt;br&gt;
Stealing, discarding, picking up, or receiving them wouldn't work.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Those were the rules put in place so that Chimata, the market god, could obtain power.&lt;br&gt;
Iizunamaru thought of the markets as pure business, but for Chimata, they were a ritual of worship for her to regain her divine strength.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

When friction began to openly develop between the two of them, a force of destruction that would end it all arrived.&lt;br&gt;
She called that force of destruction a "robber"-- the so-called destroyer of the market, who tried to solve things through violence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Strangely enough, that human "robber" arrived on a night when a rainbow encircled the moon, just like their first market had.

{{nihongo|'''Chiyuri Kitashirakawa'''|北白河　ちゆり|Kitashirakawa Chiyuri}} is a graduate school alumnus from the [[outside world]] and [[Yumemi Okazaki]]'s assistant who helps her to collect data on magic. She follows Yumemi into [[Gensokyo]] on the [[Probability Space Hypervessel]] in order to further that goal.

==Character Design==
[[File:Th03ChiyuriAlt.png|thumb|right|140px|Chiyuri's alternate outfit in ''[[Phantasmagoria of Dim.Dream]]''.]]
===Name===
Her full name is {{nihongo|''Chiyuri Kitashirakawa''|北白河　ちゆり}}, where {{nihongo|''Kitashirakawa''|北白河}} means "north white river". &lt;!--meaning added for first name here--&gt; 

===Design===
Chiyuri's design shows that she has blonde hair and yellow eyes. She wears a white sailor uniform with a shade of blue which looks too small for her and has a blue neckerchief, a white hat and a blue ribbon. Her alternative outfit is the same, except her sailor uniform now appears to have a shade of red with a red ribbon; additionally, this outfit is worn by the Chiyuri from Gensokyo. 

==Appearances==
;''Phantasmagoria of Dim.Dream''
:{{main|Phantasmagoria of Dim.Dream/Translation/Chiyuri's Scenario|l1=Phantasmagoria of Dim.Dream Chiyuri's Scenario}}
During ''[[Phantasmagoria of Dim.Dream]]'' Chiyuri wrote an invitation flier with promises of wishes being granted to lure people to the "ruins" (which later turned out to be a ship). After putting the various heroines against each other so that only the strongest one would make it inside, she drew a gun on the winner to force her to cooperate because it was more fun that way. This turned out to be completely different from how Yumemi had wanted the situation handled, and Chiyuri was forced to fight the heroine so that Yumemi could collect research data about magic. Chiyuri was defeated much sooner than Yumemi had expected and interrupts Yumemi's threat to use a powerful bomb against the heroine after the final battle.

Chiyuri is currently believed to still be in Gensokyo along with Yumemi after her professor was kicked out of the Academy, because of the final ending of ''Phantasmagoria of Dim.Dream''.

In Chiyuri's scenario, she is a native inhabitant of Gensokyo who can use magic, and is one of the many heroines who fight each other to gain access to the ruins. Inside, she is confronted by herself from another world and fights her to to decide who's the stronger one then battles Yumemi, who wishes to study her magic. Afterwards, she follows Yumemi and the other Chiyuri to the outside world, much to the former's dismay that they can no longer return. This is, however, confusing.

==Relationships==
;[[Yumemi Okazaki]] (Senior)

==Additional Information==
*Chiyuri's appearance and speech patterns are based off on Eriko Asagaoka from [[wikipedia:Izumi Takemoto|Izumi Takemoto]]'s manga ''Apple Paradise''. ([https://onsen.touhouwiki.net/images/4/4a/Chiyuri_Eriko.jpeg comparison])
*Not counting [[Hieda no Akyuu]], who never appears in any game in the series, Chiyuri is thought to be the youngest character in the ''[[Touhou Project]]'' whose actual age is known. If any other character was younger at the time they first appeared in a game, their real age has never been revealed. It should be noted, however, that almost no one in Touhou has a known age.
*Chiyuri appears on the cover of ''[[Phantasmagoria of Dim.Dream]]'' along with all the other characters in that game.
*Because of her clothes, she is thought to be the inspiration for [[Minamitsu Murasa]] of ''[[Undefined Fantastic Object]]''.
*It is implied that her world of origin may not be the Outside World as we know it, but rather some separate world, because a grand unified theory has been completed, and children graduate from graduate school at the age of thirteen. Supporting this theory is the fact that Gensokyo appears to have its own version of Chiyuri, implying that the [[Probability Space Hypervessel]] comes from some alternate dimension altogether.
*Despite the Chiyuri from Gensokyo being capable of using magic her attacks are the same as her counterpart's. This is the only instance in the series where a character's "Player 2" design was used to represent a separate character that could be fought and controlled.

★ Resident of fantasy that runs through time ... Chiyuri Kitashirakawa

A girl with a somewhat odd way with words.  She's Yumemi's rather outspoken assistant; she seems to be able to speak frankly with her.  She may look immature, but she's 15 (probably immature). She left graduate school and works as an assistant at a university.  (In this world, you graduate from college at 11, and leave graduate school at 13.) She's specializing in comparative physics, so she's obviously pretty sharp.

Right now her primary tasks are things like organizing the data Yumemi collects.

{{nihongo|'''Cirno'''|チルノ|Chiruno}} is an ice [[fairy]] who first appeared on the second stage of ''[[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]]''. As a fairy, she is exceptionally strong for her kind, matching the power of some weak [[youkai]]. However, compared to most of [[Gensokyo]]'s residents, she's quite weak. Her personality is childish and she is sometimes considered idiotic by other characters. She stars as the main protagonist of ''[[Great Fairy Wars]]'', and one of several protagonists in ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]'' and ''[[Hidden Star in Four Seasons]]''.

==General Information==
Cirno first appeared as Stage 2 Boss in ''[[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]]'', then again as the Stage 1 midboss in ''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]''. She then again later appears as one of the many playable characters in ''[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]'' and again in ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]''. She made an appearance as a background character in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'' and then appeared as the Stage 1 midboss in ''[[Double Dealing Character]]''. She also was a Day 1 Boss in ''[[Impossible Spell Card]]'' and later became a playable character in ''[[Hidden Star in Four Seasons]]''.

While her age is unknown, she is one of the only characters in ''[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]'' that realized what was going on had happened sixty years prior as well. This implies that she has been around for at least sixty years.

===Personality===
Cirno is a childish, confident fairy who appears to have a superiority complex in regards to others. She proclaims herself to be "the strongest" on three separate occasions in ''[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]''. In the game's manual, she is labeled as {{nihongo|"9. baka"|⑨. バカ||lit. "9. Idiot"}} in an explanation of the game screen's layout. She was again labeled as such in the manual for ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]''. This implies that Cirno may be some kind of idiot, which does seem to be the case on some occasions - in [[Oriental Sacred Place]], she is quite confused as to why nobody wants to buy her water-flavored shaved ice.

Despite this, she is smart enough to know when she is in deep trouble, such as her battle against Yuuka in Phantasmagoria of Flower View's story mode. She can also read, unlike some of her peers, such as [[Mystia Lorelei]]. She can also count (she shows knowledge of rounding and fractions in ''[[Great Fairy Wars]]'').

Among other things, she enjoys using her abilities to freeze frogs, then watch them revive while thawing out in the water. However, about one in every three attempts fails, shattering the frog to pieces.&lt;ref&gt;[[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]] - Cirno's profile&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abilities===
;Manipulating cold
[[File:SBND13CirnoIcing.jpg|thumb|192px|Cirno's freezing ability in ''[[Strange and Bright Nature Deity]]''.]]
Cirno has the ability to manipulate cold to the point of being able to freeze water. However, even while saying "manipulate", when coldness is in an omitted state, it seems like her surroundings are chilly even in summer. In battle, she uses this ability to attack others with icicles, huge ice cubes, or wieldable weapons like swords, but also to freeze her opponents or their [[danmaku]].&lt;ref name="Cirno Soku"&gt;[[Touhou Hisoutensoku/Spell Cards/Cirno|Touhou Hisoutensoku - Cirno's Spell Cards]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Great Fairy Wars]] - Cirno's ''Perfect Freeze'' spell card and ''Ice Barrier'' skill&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite being able to freeze something hot like flaming danmaku, she is unable to freeze lasers.

How she exactly manipulates cold is unclear, but [[Reisen Udongein Inaba]], in one of her quotes in ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]'', speculates that when Cirno does it, she warms up inside as a result. This would mean that she just absorbs the heat in the surroundings instead of "creating" cold from nothing.

; Strength
Cirno isn't that strong. In particular, fairies have an existence below that of humans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20040404190222/http://www16.big.or.jp/~zun/cgi-bin/diary/nicky.cgi?page=1 "ZUN's blog" January 12, 2004] - [[wikipedia:Internet Archive|Wayback Machine]] (Archived April 4, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/20050408092238/http://gensou.s93.xrea.com/world/qa0307.html#03121502 "Gensou Bulletin Board" posted December 15, 2003 (Archived by まよひがねっと)] - [[wikipedia:Internet Archive|Wayback Machine]] (Archived April 8, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; However, among fairies she possesses unusually strong power.&lt;ref&gt;"Hakurei Jinja Kannushi/ZUN Interview Kannushi's Tale" "Sangetsusei Part 1" Special Book pp. 110-113.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Great Fairy Wars'', even though she wins when she battled Marisa, the one whose illustration showed to be "defeated" was Cirno; Marisa was actually both drunk and using the flashlight mode of her Mini-Hakkero to fight Cirno.

In ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'', while Akyuu says that a grown human should win easily against other fairies&lt;ref name="PMiSSFairy"&gt;[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]: [[Perfect_Memento_in_Strict_Sense/Fairy|Fairy]]&lt;/ref&gt; and feel free to vent their anger on them, against Cirno she instead cautions readers to seek an opportunity to flee.&lt;ref name="PMiSSCirno"&gt;[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]: [[Perfect_Memento_in_Strict_Sense/Cirno|Cirno]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eiki Shiki, Yamaxanadu|Eiki]] also remarks on her power compared to that of other fairies.&lt;ref name="PoFVCirno"&gt;[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]: [[Phantasmagoria_of_Flower_View/Story/Cirno%27s_Scenario#Cirno_vs._Eiki_.28Episode_Final.29|Cirno's Scenario]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character Design==
[[File:PMiSS_cirno.jpg|right|thumb|Cirno in ''Perfect Memento of Strict Sense''|150px]]
===Name===
Her known name is {{nihongo|"Cirno"/"Chiruno"|チルノ}}, which has a currently unknown origin. It's likely based on the Japanese pronunciation of the English word "chill", ''chiru'' (チル) . Her name appearing as "Chilno" in ''[[Eastern and Little Nature Deity]]'' supports this possible origin. The earliest known official romanization of "{{lang|ja|チルノ}}" is in her ''[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]'' profile as "Cirno".

===Design===
Her design in ''[[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]]'', ''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]'' and ''[[Double Dealing Character]]'' shows that Cirno has aqua-colored eyes and hair. She wears a blue ribbon, light pink blouse, blue jumper dress and seems to be wearing white socks. She also has icicle-shaped wings. In ''[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]'' and ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]'''s official art, her ribbon is green instead of blue and her sprite in ''Phantasmagoria of Flower View'' still keeps the blue ribbon. In ''[[Great Fairy Wars]]'', her bow is once again blue. Her blouse has been changed to white and she seems to have bigger eyebrows (because she was drawn by [[Makoto Hirasaka]]). It's been said that Cirno is one of the easiest designs [[ZUN]] has done.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20190917184244/http://www.gensokyo.org:80/archives/92 Notes on ZUN's Genyou Denshou Lecture] - [[wikipedia:Internet Archive|Wayback Machine]] (Archived September 17, 2019)&lt;/ref&gt;

Her alternative outfit in ''Phantasmagoria of Flower View ''is same as her normal outfit, except her bow is a darker shade of green, her blouse appears light purple, and her dress is purple as well.

Her appearance in ''[[Hidden Star in Four Seasons]]'' gives her tanned skin, a flowery vine wrapped around her body, and a sunflower ribbon around her neck. This design is a reference to the character "Tanned Sakura" from the Marvel vs. Capcom series, who in turn is a reference to the character Evil Ryu, a corrupted version of Ryu.&lt;ref&gt;Who's Who of Humans and Youkai in Gensokyo - [[Strange Creators of Outer World/Who's Who of Humans &amp; Youkai in Gensokyo/Tanned Cirno|Tanned Cirno]]&lt;/ref&gt; The sunflower on her chest may be a visual reference to Evil Ryu's hole in his chest.

In the Trial+ version of Perfect Cherry Blossom, she appears with a white sash bow around her waist. This only applies to her portrait, her boss sprites lacks the extra detail. Notably, this has been the only time Cirno had this extra accessory, it has since been gone and never appeared in any other future games or print works.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:PCB Trial Portraits.png|Portraits used in the Trial+ version of Perfect Cherry Blossom]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearances==
===Games===
;''the Embodiment of the Scarlet Devil''
[[File:Th06CirnoSprite.png|frame|Cirno's sprite in ''EoSD'']]
:{{Main|Embodiment of Scarlet Devil/Story|l1=Embodiment of Scarlet Devil Story}}
Cirno's first ever appearance in the ''[[Touhou Project]]'' was in ''[[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]]'' as the second stage boss. During the events, she attacked [[Reimu Hakurei]] and [[Marisa Kirisame]] who were just passing by, out of instinctive aggression. She was helplessly shot down. Her [[spell card]] ''Ice Sign "Icicle Fall"'' on Easy mode is considered one of the easiest spell cards in all of Touhou, as there is an obvious gap right in front of Cirno that'll get the spell card cleared quickly and simply.

;''Perfect Cherry Blossom''
[[File:Th07CirnoSprite.png|frame|Cirno's sprite in ''PCB'']]
:{{Main|Perfect Cherry Blossom/Story#Story|l1=Perfect Cherry Blossom Story}}
Cirno unusually re-appeared as the first stage midboss of ''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]'', and can be easily defeated. Cirno did not have any good reason to attack the heroines other than that they were there, as stated in her official profile. On Easy and Normal difficulty, she does not have a [[spell card]] to use, and thus uses a simple [[danmaku]] pattern. However, on Hard and Lunatic difficulties, she makes use of the spell card ''Frost Sign "Frost Columns"'', which has danmaku going in different directions and causing explosions of projectiles.

;''Phantasmagoria of Flower View''
[[File:Th09CirnoBackSprite.png|frame|left|Cirno's back sprite in ''PoFV'']]
[[File:Th09CirnoSprite.png|frame|Cirno's sprite in ''PoFV'']]
:{{Main|Phantasmagoria_of_Flower_View/Story#Cirno's Story|l1=Phantasmagoria of Flower View Story}}
In ''[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]'', Cirno aimlessly wanders about, apparently unconcerned by the flower incident and seeing the flowers as just something else for her to freeze and play with. Through her dialog, her true childish nature is revealed, leaving no doubt that she really isn't smart at all. She really wasn't meaning to do anything but play games.

;''Double Dealing Character''
[[File:Th14CirnoSprite.png|frame|Cirno's sprite in ''DDC'']]
:{{Main|Double Dealing Character/Story|l1=Double Dealing Character Story}}
Much like in ''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]'', Cirno is the stage 1 mid[[boss]] of ''[[Double Dealing Character]]'', and still did not have any good reason to attack the heroines other than that they were there. On Easy and Normal difficulty, she does not have a [[spell card]] to use, and thus uses a simple [[danmaku]] pattern. However, on Hard and Lunatic difficulties, she makes use of the spell card ''Ice Sign "Ultimate Blizzard"'', which is basically a harder version of her non-spell attack. In this game, she was given a completely new sprite design, re-used later on in ''[[Impossible Spell Card]]'', to keep up with the current ''[[Touhou Project]]'' art style.
;''Hidden Star in Four Seasons''
:{{Main|Hidden Star in Four Seasons/Story|l1=Hidden Star in Four Seasons Story}}
Cirno is one of the protagonists of this game, and is most notably wearing a tan. [[Okina Matara]] gives random people in Gensokyo power without their knowledge with the purpose of bringing out their best to see if they are worthy of being Okina's servant, or alternatively, to merely cause a show of power. Due to this, Cirno remained strong even in the midsummer heat, which caused Cirno to fall into delusions of grandeur and attempt to "Conquer" Gensokyo and become its new "Supreme Overlord". She fights her way through various inhabitations of Gensokyo, until she eventually ventures into the [[Land of the Backdoor]] and encounters Okina Matara, where she reveals to Cirno that her tan is merely a result of her overflowing with magic energy due to her supercharged rampage beginning to spread to her appearance, and that she won't be able to hold herself together for much longer if she countinues on, advising her to stop before her sense of self completely breaks down.

===Spin-offs===
;''Shoot the Bullet''
In ''[[Shoot the Bullet]]'', [[Aya Shameimaru]] encountered Cirno on [[stage]] 2 and took photos of her [[danmaku]].

;''Touhou Hisoutensoku''
:{{Main|Touhou Hisoutensoku/Translation/Cirno's Scenario|l1=Touhou Hisoutensoku Story}}
Cirno heads out, thinking that she's seen a [[daidarabotchi]]. She gets ready to leave when [[Sanae Kochiya]] asks her if she has seen a giant human-shaped object. Cirno denies seeing a daidarabotchi, which causes Sanae to be suspicious and fight Cirno. Later, Cirno passes by the [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]] when she overhears [[Hong Meiling]] mumbling about the [[Taisui Xingjun]]. Cirno becomes interested in finding the Taisui Xingjun, but focuses back on the daidarabotchi after beating Meiling. At the entrance of the [[Underground Geyser Center]], Cirno meets [[Marisa Kirisame]], who tells her that the daidarabotchi is inside the Underground Geyser Center (which was a complete lie). Once inside, Cirno is intercepted by [[Utsuho Reiuji]]. Utsuho attempts to eradicate the "foreign substance", but Cirno manages to escape being incinerated to death. After escaping, Cirno runs into Marisa, who tells her about a giant youkai in the [[Forest of Magic]]. Cirno then runs into [[Alice Margatroid]]. When Cirno tells her about a daidarabotchi, Alice realizes that Cirno is talking about her [[Goliath Doll]], and lets Cirno fight with it.

;''Great Fairy Wars''
[[File:Th128Cirno.png|thumb|175px|Cirno in ''[[Great Fairy Wars]]'', by [[Makoto Hirasaka]].]]
:{{Main|Great Fairy Wars/Translation/Route A|l1=Great Fairy Wars Route A|Fairy Wars/Translation/Route B|l2=Route B|Great Fairy Wars/Translation/Route C|l3=Route C}}
Cirno is the protagonist and the only playable character of ''[[Great Fairy Wars]]'', who only has one "shot type". Unlike other games, Cirno is able to freeze [[danmaku]]. Almost any bullet will freeze if it comes in contact with the ice resulting in long, elaborate chains of ice. The bomb is not that regular. It is named the "perfect freeze" which will also freeze all the bullets that are on the screen.

Following ''[[Strange and Bright Nature Deity]]'' volume 2 special "Great Fairy Wars", after the [[Three Fairies of Light]] destroyed her home, she charges off for vengeance on them. After battling trough the various fairies, and two of the three fairies, she finally meets the Three Fairies of Light. Cirno is not afraid even though they are with three. Cirno eventually wins and they become friends.

On the Extra stage, Cirno decides to fight a [[youkai]] to prove she's the strongest. After passing through strong fairies, she instead encounters a [[human]]: [[Marisa Kirisame]]. Not taking things easy, Marisa decides to play with her using her "non-deadly lasers". After a harsh battle, it appeared that Cirno was defeated, but surprised Marisa that she was able to put up a good fight. However, Marisa states that she let her guard down a bit. They both went home to settle.

;''Hopeless Masquerade''
[[File:Th135Cirno.png|frame|Cirno in ''HM'']]
Cirno made a background cameo appearance in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'' on the [[Hall of Dreams' Great Mausoleum]] and [[Youkai Tanuki Forest]] stage. She is seen floating and occasionally making a shock expression.

;''Impossible Spell Card''
Presumably from hearing or seeing a wanted sign about the mischief-making [[amanojaku]] [[Seija Kijin]], Cirno appears to be one of the many [[youkai]] that tries to capture her. She uses [[spell card]]s that are considered impossible to dodge.

===Literature===
;''Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red''
''[[Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red]]'' writes about a certain incident where Cirno got eaten by a giant toad. When interviewed by [[Aya Shameimaru]] about it, she tries to convince her to spin the story a different way, and is turned down.

;Strange and Bright Nature Deity, Oriental Sacred Place
Cirno appears every now and again to join the [[Three Fairies of Light]] on their pranking adventures. One of the extra chapters leads directly into the events of ''[[Great Fairy Wars]]'', as well.

; [[Visionary Fairies in Shrine]]
{{Stub|section}}

==Relationships==
===Three Fairies of Light===
All of the members of [[Three Fairies of Light]] – [[Sunny Milk]], [[Luna Child]] and [[Star Sapphire]] – are both a friend and an enemy of Cirno. With Luna, she is later seen with Cirno in ''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'' watching [[Moriya Shrine]]'s cold fusion experiment.

===Eternity Larva===
[[Eternity]] and Cirno are implied to have known each other before the events of Hidden Star in Four Seasons. Eternity notices Cirno's tan before they fight to see who the summer belongs to. Eternity also appears in Cirno's ending.

===Minor Relationships===
;Daiyousei
[[Daiyousei]] is first seen (presumably) associated with Cirno in ''[[Strange and Bright Nature Deity]]'' Chapter 13 when both of them were playing hide and seek. After meeting and talking with the Three Fairies of Light, Cirno appears to have completely forgotten about Daiyousei. She was later seen attacking Cirno in ''[[Fairy Wars]]''.

;Letty Whiterock
Nothing is known about Cirno's relationship with [[Letty Whiterock]]. She appears to dislike being grouped up with her as she explains her superiority when interviewed by [[Aya Shameimaru]] in ''[[Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red]]''. She is also briefly seen talking to Letty during ''[[Silent Sinner in Blue]]''.

;Rumia, Wriggle Nightbug and Mystia Lorelei
[[Rumia]], along with [[Wriggle Nightbug]] and [[Mystia Lorelei]], seem to get along and appear together to help during various events prepared by the Three Fairies of Light, although Rumia appears to be of no help. It is unknown whether they are friends or just happened to be in the same place at the same time (Twice).

;Reimu Hakurei
Reimu Hakurei is one of Cirno's targets for her pranks in ''[[Oriental Sacred Place]]''. She later helped the Three Fairies of Light in supporting the [[Hakurei Shrine]] against [[Myouren Temple]].

;Giant Toad
The [[Giant Toad]] is a [[toad]] that once ate Cirno because she was freezing all the other toads.

==Additional Information==
*Even though Cirno isn't the final boss of ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]'' and ''[[Great Fairy Wars]]'', she appears as the silhouette on both jewel cases. Along with [[Sumireko Usami]], she's the only character to appear as the silhouette for two games' jewel cases in the [[Windows]] games.
*Cirno's alternate color palette  in ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]'' resembles that of [[Alice Margatroid]]'s and [[Reimu Hakurei]]'s color palette from [[PC-98]] era.
*Shibata Masahiro's manga series "[https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/manga.php?id=1648 Sarai]" seems to be a big inspiration for many of the characters from EoSD . Sarai is a manga about superpowered maids fighting youkai and monsters in a dystopian future. The series was published from 1997 to 2007 in Japan only. 
**Cirno shares the same name with [https://onsen.touhouwiki.net/wiki/File:Cirno_%26_Tapa.jpeg Cirno] from Sarai.

Stage 2 boss. A girl of snow.

Her intellect is not very developed. She's just a child. To [[Reimu Hakurei|Reimu]] and [[Marisa Kirisame|Marisa]], she can be easily defeated.

She likes playing tricks and often toys with frogs. She freezes them instantly, then watches them revive as they thaw in the water. She tends to fail one out of every 3 attempts, however, and the poor amphibian shatters to pieces.

Total of four card attacks.

Cirno radiates chilling air from herself, whether it be summer or winter, so the air around her is always cold. It's cold in the spring as well of course. Autumn too.

'''Fairy of the Ice, Cirno'''

The small fairy was as agitated as usual. Because today, she had seen something bigger than the mountain.

Of course, in reality, it was much smaller than the mountain, but from her impression, there wasn't that big of a difference. It was soon hidden in mist and disappeared from sight, but she was certain. It was definitely the great youkai "[[Daidarabotchi]]".

She didn't know where it normally lived, but a moment after she became excited by seeing a rare youkai, the shrine maiden descended from the Youkai Mountain.

"Have you seen any giant robo... anything big moving around here?"

Asking that, the [[Sanae Kochiya|shrine maiden]] started searching in the mist.

The small fairy found itself driven on by an odd irritation, thinking that she saw it first, so it was her thing.

"I didn't see any Daidarabotchi."

Saying that, she diverted the shrine maiden. From nothing more than simple curiosity, she decided to search for the great youkai here.

An overconfident child who doesn't know her place, that's the image of her character. She made multiple appearances throughout the series, and she's still relevant as of today, which I had never expected at the point I made her.

{{nihongo|'''Clownpiece'''|クラウンピース|Kuraunpīsu}} is a [[fairy]] of [[Hell]]. She is also the main protagonist of ''[[Visionary Fairies in Shrine]]''.

==General Information==
Clownpiece appeared as the Stage 5 Boss in ''[[Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom]]'' and as the main protagonist of ''[[Visionary Fairies in Shrine]]'', along with [[Sunny Milk]], [[Star Sapphire]], and [[Luna Child]]. She is [[Hecatia Lapislazuli]]'s subordinate, who has instructed her to live in Gensokyo for the time being. She currently lives under the [[Hakurei Shrine]] in a replica Hell she made for herself. Other characters often refer to her as "Piece", a shortening of her name.

===Personality===
Clownpiece is similar in nature to many of the other fairies in Touhou: she is playful, mischievous, childish, and a little bit dumb. She enjoys the aesthetics of Hell, often leading to strange looks from others; however, this is because it reminds her of  home. She enjoys pranking anybody she can, friends included. She often joins the Three Fairies of Light in their own schemes, pranks, and adventures, and has a little bit of a rivalry with Cirno over the title of the "strongest". Generally, she is a fun-loving person who's also a little bit ignorant of her surroundings: she's set fire to the Hakurei Shrine by accident on more than one occasion.

===Abilities===
;Driving people to madness
:With the flame of her torch, Clownpiece is able to drive others insane. According to herself, any human looking at the light of her torch would be unable to maintain their sanity, making her able to mess with their minds.&lt;ref name="VFiS1" /&gt; In the [[Human Village]], she used this ability to make villagers extremely irritable and short-tempered, attacking each other for trivial reasons. According to her, going crazy means bringing out one's true strength.&lt;ref&gt;[[Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom]] - Sanae's scenario: '''Clownpiece:''' Y'see, the light from my torchdrives anyone it touches crazy. And going crazy means bringing out your true strength. I'm gonna beat you down with this tremendous power!&lt;/ref&gt;
:Clownpiece claims that, while this may seem like an unusual power for a nature spirit, it's nothing strange in Hell where "nature" consists mainly of the souls of the dead. The torch itself is made with the lifeforce of those that fell in Hell.&lt;ref name="VFiS10"&gt;[[Visionary Fairies in Shrine]] - Chapter 10&lt;/ref&gt;

;Making lifeforce go berserk
:The true power of Clownpiece's flame is revealed by [[Eternity Larva]], who recognized the power she experienced during the [[Hidden Star in Four Seasons|Four Seasons incident]]. The flame of the torch is able to affect the lifeforce and make it go berserk. Eternity used this power in full winter to instantly make it summer near the [[Hakurei Shrine]], filling bare trees with leaves, and even turning some of them into palm trees. Although this completely consumed the torch's fire, she assumed it would eventually be back on its own.&lt;ref name="VFiS10" /&gt;

;Embodiment of [[impurity]]
:Clownpiece was among the fairies exposed to [[Junko]]'s abilities prior to the events of ''[[Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom]]'', transforming her into a being of pure lifeforce whom the [[Lunarian]]s could not fight without [[Impurity|becoming permanently tainted]]. It's unclear whether this is still true by the time she comes to [[Gensokyo]].

==Character Design==

===Origin===
Clownpiece is based on [[wikipedia:Lampad|lampads]]&lt;ref name=SCoOW&gt;[[Strange Creators of Outer World/Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom interview with ZUN]] - Clownpiece section.&lt;/ref&gt;, nymphs who serve the [https://www.theoi.com/Khthonios/Hekate.html goddess Hecate], the basis of [[Hecatia Lapislazuli|Hecatia]]. Lampads accompany Hecate on her night-time travels and carry torches which have the power to drive someone to madness, like Clownpiece.

===Design===
Clownpiece wears leggings and a shirt with the pattern similar to the [[wikipedia:Flag of the United States|American flag]]. As she resembles a jester, she has a frilled collar and a purple, polka-dotted jester's hat. She has long, blonde hair and pink eyes. She also has a pair of fairy wings and carries a torch.

==Appearances==
===Games===
;''Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom''
[[File:Th15ClownpieceSprite.png|frame|Clownpiece's sprite in ''LoLK'']]
Clownpiece appears as the Stage 5 boss of the game. 
She appears at the beggining of the stage and order the other fairies to attack the player. After defeating them, the player encounters again with her and Clownpiece misleads the heroine with a capital citizen and attacks her. After being defeated, exhausted and knowing the heroine is not from the moon, she lets her continue her voyage to the Sea of Tranquility to meet [[Junko]].

===Literature===
;''Visionary Fairies in Shrine''

While setting up a prank on [[Reimu Hakurei]], The [[Three Fairies of Light]] hear her make mention of a new fairy. Curious about her identity, they travel to the Human Village, where they find Clownpiece manipulating the minds of the humans there, causing them to become aggressive toward one another. When confronted by The Three Fairies of Light, Clownpiece explains her power to drive people mad, and mentions that she is from [[Hell]], but doesn't want to return there. Impressed by her ability, they invite her to live with them, but she declines, stating that she has [[Reimu Hakurei|someone else to live with]]. At the mention of pranking opportunities, however, Clownpiece expresses curiosity toward their abilities, and they introduce themselves. However, Clownpiece fails to comprehend and memorize their fairly simple introduction, so [[Sunny Milk]] tells her not to worry about it. [[Luna Child]] warns Clownpiece not to play her pranks in the Human Village, because the Shrine Maiden has her eye on Clownpiece. With that, The Three Fairies of Light depart home. As they leave, Clownpiece remarks her interest in the three of them.

==Relationships==
;[[Junko]]
Junko tried to fill the moon with fairies' life forces by using her ability and Clownpiece.
;[[Hecatia Lapislazuli]]
Clownpiece is a subordinate of Hecatia, who allows Junko to use Clownpiece in her scheme against the [[Lunar Capital]].
;[[Three Fairies of Light]]
Clownpiece met the three fairies when she was new to Gensokyo. After sparking interest in them, they became fast friends.
;[[Reimu Hakurei]]
After the events of ''Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom,'' Clownpiece moved to Gensokyo. She lives directly beneath the Hakurei Shrine, where Reimu keeps a watchful eye on her after she found out Clownpiece snuck into there.

Clownpiece&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Species: [[Fairy]]&lt;br&gt;
Ability: Capable of driving people mad&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

A fairy from [[Hell]].&lt;br&gt;
One of Hecatia's subordinates.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Fairies can be found just about anywhere; Hell is no different.&lt;br&gt;
However, the [[Lunarian]]s eliminate fairies, as they reject life and death.&lt;br&gt;
There are almost no fairies around the [[Lunar Capital]].&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Under Hecatia's orders, she filled the [[Sea of Tranquility]] with fairies she brought with her from Hell.&lt;br&gt;
Thanks to her and her friends, the Sea of Tranquility was transformed into a fairy playland.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Then, thanks to [[Junko]]'s ability, they were awakened.&lt;br&gt;
They can be said to be a mass of totally pristine life energy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

"If you play around here, the Lunarians will be unable to act.&lt;br&gt;
As long as nobody goes and sullies themselves with impurity, they'll be completely trapped."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

...that's what she was told. So, she played to her heart's content.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The lunar surface was a desolate world, but compared to Hell, it was still beautiful and fun.&lt;br&gt;
The fairies played and frolicked.&lt;br&gt;
Just by doing that, the Lunarians were bound in place.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Though the Lunar Capital showed no signs of action for a long time,&lt;br&gt;
a [[human]] flew over from there at last.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

"If anyone comes from the Lunar Capital, go wild. Do anything you like."&lt;br&gt;
As she remembered being told that, she was as ecstatic as could be.

{{nihongo|'''{{H:title|Daiyousei|This is unofficial name, but it may have been used as a term by ZUN}}'''|大妖精|Daiyousei}} is a greater [[fairy]] who lives around the [[Misty Lake]] near the [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]]. Like other fairies, she's cheerful and mischievous, simple and emotional. Little is known about her.

==General Information==
Little is known about this midboss who not even has a portrait in the few games she appears in. In the little appearances she makes in print works, they are only cameos where she doesn't even speak (in chapter 14 of ''[[Visionary Fairies in Shrine]]'' she is seen speaking with other fairies, but it's unknown about what). So, we know next to nothing about the fairy that appears with [[Cirno|one of the most famous Touhou characters]], or what abilities she has.

===Personality===
ZUN explains that the personality of the greater fairies is the same as the other fairies: cheerful and mischievous; simple and expressive. &lt;ref&gt; [[ZUN's_former_blog_"Touhou_Shofu"_6|Touhou Shofu #6]] "その性格は他の妖精と変わらず、陽気でいたずら好き。単純で表情豊かです。" (Their personalities are the same as those of other fairies: cheerful and mischievous. They are simple and expressive) &lt;/ref&gt; 

===Species===
In response to questions from fans, [[ZUN]] revealed some information about her such as "Ordinary fairies are weaker than humans. Greater fairies are mightier than other fairies." &lt;ref&gt;[[ZUN's_former_blog_"Touhou_Shofu"_6|Touhou Shofu #6]] "２面中ボスは大妖精。４面中ボスは小悪魔です。 妖精は人間以下の存在ですが、その中でも力のある者が大妖精です。(The 2nd midboss is 'Greater Fairy'. The 4th midboss is 'Little Devil'. Fairies are weaker than humans, but fairies with higher power are greater fairies.)"&lt;/ref&gt; Cirno is said to be a very special exception in ''[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]'', but according to this, "Greater Fairy" seems to be a generic term for some mighty fairies. She's said to be one of the normal-enemy class (not boss-class) characters.

==Character Design==
===Name===
Daiyousei wasn't given an official name at the time ''[[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]]'' was released. ZUN confirmed soon after that she didn't have any official name, though he had done rough sketches for face graphics and initially planned for her, as well as [[Koakuma]], to have their own spell cards.&lt;ref&gt;[[ZUN's reply to messages on the former Gensou Bulletin Board 1]]&lt;/ref&gt; Fans nicknamed her {{nihongo|''Daiyousei''|大妖精||lit. "Big Fairy" or "Greater Fairy"}}. [[ZUN]] later used this nickname in an [[ZUN%27s_reply_to_messages_on_the_former_Gensou_Bulletin_Board_1|interview]], although he used it as a general term for all stronger-than-normal fairies, so the name ''Daiyousei'' is still not really a name for this character. 

The data files for ''[[Fairy Wars]]'' reveals that the file name for her sprites is called "enemy_bf.anm", furthering her identification. "bf" is likely an abbreviation for "Big Fairy".

===Design===
[[File:Th06Daiyousei.png|thumb|right|Sprite of Daiyousei in ''[[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]]'']]
[[File:Th128Daiyousei.png|thumb|right|Sprite of Daiyousei in '''[[Fairy Wars]]''']]
The design of Daiyousei appears to show that she has short green hair with a yellow ribbon. She wears a blue dress with white trim and sleeves and also has golden wings. The sprite in ''[[Fairy Wars]]'' shows that she was holding a bouquet of flowers.

==Appearances==
===Games===
;''Embodiment of Scarlet Devil''
{{Main|Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil/Story|l1=Embodiment of Scarlet Devil Story}}
During the events of ''[[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]]'' the heroine was attacked by Daiyousei while flying over the [[Misty Lake]] around the [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]]. Very little is known about her, even why she attacked the heroine, and she had no importance to the story.

===Literature===
;''Strange and Bright Nature Deity''
In chapter 13 of Strange and Bright Nature Deity, Daiyousei was shown to be playing hide and seek with [[Cirno]], and gets warned by [[Reimu Hakurei]] about an incoming typhoon.
[[File:SaBNDch13_daiyousei.png|thumb|left|SaBND Chapter 13 cameo.]]

;''Visionary Fairies in Shrine''
She is seen in chapter 1 with Cirno when the Three Fairies of Light ask around about a fairy. 
Later on, she is one of the fairies who fights [[Okina Matara]] in the [[Land of the Back Door]].

==Relationships==
===Cirno===
Daiyousei appears as the midboss of the stage where Cirno is the boss in ''[[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]]'', and she is first seen (presumably) associated with [[Cirno]] in ''[[Visionary Fairies in Shrine]]'' where she appears with her when the [[Three Fairies of Light]] were asking about a [[Clownpiece|new fairy]]. In ''[[Strange and Bright Nature Deity]]'' Chapter 13, both of them were playing hide and seek, but after meeting and talking with the [[Three Fairies of Light]], Cirno appears to have completely forgotten about Daiyousei. She was later seen attacking Cirno in ''[[Fairy Wars]]''.

===Minor relationships===
;Letty Whiterock
Daiyousei and Cirno both attend the third Tori no Ichi with [[Letty Whiterock]] in ''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]''.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Additional Information==
*Her appearance in ''[[Fairy Wars]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; Extra stage with [[Lily White]] marks the second ever appearance as a double midboss in the ''[[Touhou Project]]'', where as the first time shown as a double midboss was the [[Two Red Dots]], which are two strange creatures.
*Daiyousei is one of the few characters who doesn't appear in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'' as a background character. The reason is unknown.

This mirror-like being was found in the [[Fantasy World]] and is the third stage midboss of ''[[Lotus Land Story]]''. After [[Reimu Hakurei]] or [[Marisa Kirisame]] passes some [[bakebake]], the mirror will attack the player early, who'll shoot [[danmaku]] with different kinds of patterns. The mirror will move diagonally or side to side around the screen. It'll drop a 1-up if it's defeated. If not killed, it'll eventually fly off the screen downwards before the background fully changes to the "outer space" scenery. Since it's got no dialogue with the player, nothing is known about it.

==Character Design==
===Name===
This mirror is nameless, but {{nihongo|"Dark Mirror"|闇鏡|Yamikagami}} seems to be a notable name in the Japanese community, but more notably is just referred to as {{nihongo|"LLS 3rd Stage Midboss"|幻想郷三面中ボス}}. Due to it's looks however, some Western fans call this midboss the "Magic Mirror" or the "Magic Mirror Midboss", but due to the [[Spirit Mirror]], it's better to refer to it as the "Magic Mirror ([[Demon]])" or the "Magic Mirror Midboss (Demon)" to avoid confusion.

===Design===
The sprite shows that it looks like a black mirror outlined in a crystal blue frame with a "tail" at the bottom with spikes curving out of it in the resemblance of a bony chest with what appears to be two black "strings" on both sides. The mirror has [[devil]] wings and a small antenna at the top. When it spins while moving, it appears to be completely flat. It somewhat appears similar to the [[Evil Eye]].

==Additional Information==
*Its species could possibly be an [[Tsukumogami#Ungaikyo|Ungaikyo]], a type of Tsukumogami, that are living mirrors that occasionally have occult powers. They are [[demon]]s that come out of antique mirrors. 
*It might actually have come from [[Mugenkan]].
*It might have some relation to the [[Spirit Mirror]] of ''[[Mystic Square]]''.
*It seems to be the flattest character in the whole series, being the size of only one pixel.
*In a broad sense, it is the first character to flip (i.e. not rotating like [[SinGyoku]] does).

{{nihongo|'''Doremy Sweet'''|ドレミー・スイート|Doremī Suīto}} is a [[baku]] and Ruler of the [[Dream World]].

==General Information==
Doremy first appeared as the Stage 3 Boss and then as the Extra stage midboss in ''[[Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom]]''. She later appears as a playable character in [[Antinomy of Common Flowers]]. She owns a dream journal which is said to record the dreams of everyone who has ever dreamt in their life.

===Personality===
Doremy usually has a calm disposition and isn't prone to anger or other moods. The only times she displayed a different emotion was amazement at the heroine when they entered the Dream World with their physical body or worry when she realized the [[Yukari Yakumo|gap youkai]] messed with the boundary between the real world and the [[Dream World]] &lt;ref&gt; ''[[Antinomy of Common Flowers]]'' - Sumireko and Doremy's Scenario &lt;/ref&gt;. She also has a penchant for educating people whenever they ask questions regarding the Dream World and the knowledge she possesses, resembling a psychoanalyst in the process. She's also shown to have a playful attitude, usually showing an unnerving smile even when talking about dire topics, but can talk in a serious manner when an incident like the Perfect Possession interferes not only with the Dream World but with other worlds like Gensokyo or the Outside World.

===Abilities===
;Eating and creating dreams
Doremy can eat and create dreams. Eating dreams is much like just taking dreams, or stopping them, and possibly includes removing said dreams from memory completely. She is also able to create or craft dreams, which can be done by either moving the character from one dream to another or simply just forming a new dream for the character. She can also enter dreams herself. As someone who manages the dream world, she has a wide knowledge of dreams and can observe anyone's dream inside the dream world. As such, she can also gain knowledge of a character through their dreams alone. She is regarded by [[Reisen_Udongein_Inaba|Reisen]] as the most dangerous youkai in the dream world.

Doremy can freely go between multiple worlds including [[Gensokyo]], the [[Moon]] and [[Lunar Capital]], as well as the [[Outside World]]. &lt;ref&gt; ''[[Antinomy of Common Flowers]]'' - [[Sumireko]] and Doremy's Ending &lt;/ref&gt; She also can clone herself and keep track of experiences and knowledge from each clone. &lt;ref&gt; ''[[Antinomy of Common Flowers]]'' - [[Sumireko]]'s Scenario &lt;/Ref&gt; In [[Antinomy of Common Flowers]], she also showed that she could possess certain characters without the use of the perfect possession incident.

Although Doremy introduces herself as the "Ruler of Dreams" to a lot of characters, ZUN has commented that while it sounds amazing, it doesn't really mean much since even if someone reaches the top in a dream, it's still just a dream.&lt;ref&gt;[[Strange Creators of Outer World/Antinomy of Common Flowers Interview with ZUN x Iruka Unabara|Strange Creators of Outer World: Antinomy of Common Flowers Interview with ZUN and Iruka Unabara]] - '''ZUN:''' Being the ruler of dreams sounds amazing, but it's really not all that much. Even if you work super hard to reach the top in a dream, it's still just a dream. It's not a big deal, and you don't picture baku as particularly strong youkai anyway. They just can't escape the image of the real animal. And, well, Doremy's a baku.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Occupation===
Doremy manages the Dream World, keeping a close eye on the dream selves to make sure they don't leave. She has once compared herself to a zookeeper. In ''[[Antinomy of Common Flowers]]'', she possesses [[Reisen Udongein Inaba]]'s dream version so she couldn't make a ruckus in the real world and take advantage to investigate the incident. She did the same with [[Sumireko Usami]] as she was in the Dream World that time, instead of Gensokyo.

It's important to note that her ability doesn't allow her to create new dream souls or at least recreate an existing one, and she can't destroy them either, as they need to be managed naturally within the rules of the dream world. She says she is more of a "zookeeper" than a "ruler" &lt;ref&gt; ''[[Curiosities of Lotus Asia]]'' - "'' ''"I can't interfere to that extent. I may call myself a ruler, but I'm closer to the zookeeper of a zoo full of dream residents. A zookeeper can't simply make a new animal."'' ([[Curiosities of Lotus Asia/Chapter 33|Chapter 33]]) &lt;/ref&gt; 

==Character Design==
===Name===
Her full name is {{nihongo|''Doremy Sweet''|ドレミー・スイート}}, which implies a western origin. "Doremy" is phonetically similar to "dreamy", as well as spanish/portuguese "dormir" meaning "to sleep", and together with her last name, which in itself is a real surname, is a reference to the English expression "sweet dreams". (The dot ({{lang|ja|・}}) in the middle of her name is used in foreign names to show where the next word begins, as Japanese doesn't normally use spaces.)

Her name is a reference to the Sanjou route on the [[:wikipedia:Ikoma Cable Line|Ikoma Cable Line]], a group of funicular routes in Nara, Japan, operated by [[:wikipedia:Kintetsu Railway|Kintetsu Railway]].  The route's two cable cars are named "{{nihongo|''Do-Re-Mi''|ドレミ}}", which is decorated like an organ, and "{{nihongo|''Sweet''|スイート}}", which is decorated like a cake. Coincidentally the same company also operates a second funicular route in Osaka, the [[:wikipedia:Nishi-Shigi Cable Line|Nishi-Shigi Cable Line]], which serves [[:wikipedia:Mount Shigi|Mount Shigi]].  Mount Shigi was the site of the major backstory events of both [[Toyosatomimi no Miko]] and [[Mononobe no Futo]], and [[Byakuren Hijiri]] and the [[Myouren Temple]] (based on the real-life Chougo-sonshi Buddhist temple).

===Design===
Doremy has dark blue eyes and hair and possesses a white tail with a black tuft of fur at the tip. Her outfit consists of a black and white dress, which is covered in black and white orbs of various sizes. She wears a red nightcap and white socks. In her left hand is a blue book with the letter D printed on the cover, and in her right is a blob of some pink material [[Strange_Creators_of_Outer_World/Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom_interview_with_ZUN|later confirmed]] to actually be a dream soul from ''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]''. Her damaged portrait after the battle reveals that she has long hair underneath the nightcap.

In ''[[Antinomy of Common Flowers]]'', her nightcap is noticeably longer, reaching her legs. Instead of the black top of her dress, she instead wears a black capelet. The rim of her hat, capelet, and dress now has a white stitch-like pattern. Her book has an added bookmark shaped like her tail.

==Appearances==
===Games===
;''Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom''
[[File:Th15DoremySprite.png|frame|Doremy's sprite in ''LoLK'']]
About half a year before the arrival of the protagonists, Doremy was directed by [[Sagume Kishin]] to recreate the Lunar Capital in the dream world. The purpose was to discretely redirect all people heading to the Lunar Capital, to the Capital within the dream world instead in order to hide the true Lunar Capital on the moon. However, Doremy viewed this as troublesome and had no intention to always follow through.

When the protagonists arrived about 6 months later, Doremy saw this as an opportunity as a little payback and thus, after giving a small warning, sent them to where they really wanted, the true Lunar Capital. Doremy later returns in the extra stage in an I told you so manner in regards to the warnings she had given to the protagonists.

===Spin-offs===
;''Antinomy of Common Flowers''
:{{Main|Antinomy of Common Flowers#Story|l1=Antinomy of Common Flowers: Story}}
The "Perfect Possession" phenomenon is affecting the [[Dream World]] and some of its inhabitants are expelled into the real world because of it. Doremy decides to oversee the situation and split herself to keep an eye on different dream dwellers in the real world. She is a playable character with the Dream World version of [[Reisen Udongain Inaba|Reisen]], who posseses thanks to the Perfect Possesion.

;''Violet Detector''
:{{Main|Violet_Detector#Story|l1=Violet Detector: Story}}
Doremy is observing Dream [[Sumireko Usami]] as she struggles in the Dream World against the dream dwellers that keep attacking her.

===Literature===
;''Alternative Facts in Eastern Utopia''
[[Aya Shameimaru]] investigates ominous occurrences where people are reporting having common dreams after using Doremy's "Sweet Sleep Pillow". These dreams apparently were all about this same figure, Doremy, asking questions about the quality of the pillow in a sort of survey within their dreams. The pillow itself is said to have become very popular among humans as well as fairies. The pillows themselves have frills along the edges and are covered with Malayan (Asian) tapirs wearing hats similar to Doremy's.

;''Curiosities of Lotus Asia''
In chapter 33, after [[Marisa Kirisame]], [[Reimu Hakurei]] and [[Rinnosuke Morichika]] discussed about the sudden disappearance of [[Sumireko Usami]], Reimu decides that if the [[Dream World]] is involved, the appropriate person to call for help is its ruler. 

Reimu arrives some days later at [[Kourindou]] with Doremy, where Doremy explains that when Sumireko comes to Gensokyo she does it with the help of a doppelganger. However, the Dream Sumireko, that normally was in the Dream World, started to think that she was the real Sumireko, stole the Doppelganger Sumireko's body and is now wild in the [[Dream World]], which makes Sumireko unable to have dreams and, as a result, unable to come to Gensokyo. 

After explaining that she can't directly force Dream Sumireko out of the Dream World or make her change her mind, they decide that the only person who can solve this problem is Sumireko herself, even though Doremy warned them that the Dream Sumireko became real powerful.

==Relationships==
;[[Reimu Hakurei]]
While speaking to Reimu, Doremy spoke with direct recognition unlike her conversation with the rest of the protagonists during the events of [[Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom]]

;[[Sumireko Usami]]
In Antimony of Common Flowers, Doremy teams up with Sumireko. During the incident, Sumireko is faced with fighting both her dream-self and her occult doppelganger, who have also teamed up to take down the "real" Sumireko. Doremy expresses confusion over how there can possibly be three Sumirekos at the same time in Gensokyo, but ultimately helps Sumireko resolve her issue at the time. Because of Sumireko's condition, Doremy keeps an extra eye on her.

==Additional Information==
*The design of her outfit may be a reference to the body of the [[wikipedia:Malayan tapir|Malayan Tapir]], which shares the name baku with the youkai in folklore. The Malayan tapir has a black upper body, white lower body and trunk, which might be represented in Doremy's dichromatic dress and long hat, respectively. 
*In [[Antimony of Common Flowers]], Doremy has an alternate color palette that resembles [[Clownpiece]]'s color scheme,one that resembles [[Sagume Kishin]]'s and another that resembles [[wikipedia:Link (The Legend of Zelda)|Link]] from [[wikipedia:The Legend of Zelda|Zelda]].

She watches over the place to ensure that those who realize this don't disturb the order of things.&lt;br /&gt;

Under Sagume's orders, she recreated the Lunar Capital within a dream.&lt;br /&gt;
Those heading to the Lunar Capital would be sent to the Capital in the dream; thus, the real Capital was hidden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

However, it seems that this plan was bothersome to her, and she didn't feel like playing along.&lt;br /&gt;
Also, it had been over half a year already, but there was still no sign of progress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

It was then that a visitor to the Dream World arrived.&lt;br /&gt;
Astonishingly, it was a human in their physical body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

The People of the Moon hate humans' [[impurity]].&lt;br /&gt;
On the surface, she couldn't guide any such humans to the Lunar Capital.&lt;br /&gt;
Her true intent was to get a little bit of payback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

She sent the human off to the true Lunar Capital, just as they desired.

The {{nihongo|'''Dragon'''|龍|Ryū}}, also called {{nihongo|'''Dragon God'''|龍神|Ryūjin}} is, according to ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'', ''[[Curiosities of Lotus Asia]]'', and ''[[Touhou Sangetsusei]]'', the highest [[god]] of [[Gensokyo]]. All living things, whether [[human]] or [[youkai]], worship the dragon god. The dragon lives in sea or sky or rain, and regardless of the Great [[Hakurei Border]], the Dragon can move freely through [[heaven]], [[hell]], [[netherworld]], and the [[Outside World|outside world]]. Its voice divides the sky and causes thunderstorms. When it winds its body it causes mountains to crumble and earthquakes to occur. Despite being destructive, it is at the same time Gensokyo's god of creation&lt;ref name="PMiSSDragon"&gt;''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'': [[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Dragon|Dragon]]&lt;/ref&gt;, and the rain, the rivers, abundant greens are all due to the dragon's help.

The source of this is not just from [[Rinnosuke Morichika]], but also from several other sources like [[Hieda no Akyuu]], [[Reimu Hakurei]], the [[Three Fairies of Light]] etc. The dragon god commands wide respect in Gensokyo.

==Concept==
===Name and origin===
Although sometimes simply called "the Dragon", this being has also been called {{nihongo|'''Ryuujin'''|龍神|Dragon God}}. In japanese mythology, Ryuujin is considered the tutelary deity of the sea, and is often considered the same being as {{nihongo|'''Ōwatatsumi no kami'''|大綿津見神|Great Deity of the Sea}}. Ryuujin is also the father of the goddesses Toyotama-hime and Tamayori-hime, who are themselves the mythological basis for [[Watatsuki no Toyohime]] and [[Watatsuki no Yorihime]], as well as the master of the legendary Dragon Palace, which in the Touhou series is actually the [[Lunar Capital]].

===Appearance===
According to ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'', the Dragon God looks like a serpent with hands and horns, is thicker than a great tree that's thousands of years old, and it's so long that it can block out the sky.

===Abilities===
In nature, there are the three attributes of the three lights, four seasons, and five phases. Within this, the dragon god comes from the five phases (commonly called [[wikipedia:Wu Xing|Wu Xing]]). Before the dragon god created the five phases, the loop of sky to rain to sea repeated over and over, and it was a perfectly harmonious world. Into this, the dragon god bestowed the shape of the seven colors of the rainbows, and the flow of the three, sky to rain, rain to sea, and sea to sky became wood engendering fire, fire engendering earth, earth engendering metal, metal engendering water, water engendering wood, wood conquering earth, earth conquering water, water conquering fire, fire conquering metal, metal conquering wood, thus creating complication and ten powers of destruction.&lt;ref&gt;[[Curiosities of Lotus Asia]]: [[Curiosities of Lotus Asia/Chapter 19|Chapter 19]]&lt;/ref&gt; It is according to this that all things in existence are created.

Since the Dragon God has such an astonishing scale of power as to create and destroy Gensokyo, it is no mistake to say that the dragon god has the top class of power. However, since the dragon god has never clearly appeared in any work so far other than being mentioned, judgments on its power should be put on hold.

==Story==
===Backstory===
{{stub|section
| reason =
*Needs filling}}
The Dragon was said to have last been seen during the Creation of the [[Hakurei Border]]. At that time, the [[youkai sages]] staked their existence on pledging eternal peace to the dragon.
&lt;!--was not seen since the time of Gensokyo's creation.

The dragon god leaves a rainbow behind as a trace.--&gt;

==Additional Information==
[[File:FS Dragon God Statue.png|100px|thumb|right|A depiction of the statue from ''Forbidden Scrollery'']]
===The Dragon God's Statue===
The {{nihongo|'''Dragon God's Statue'''|龍神の石像|Ryūjin no sekizō}} is an artifact made by [[kappa]] that is kept in the [[Human Village]]. The eyes of the Dragon's statue are said to accurately predict the weather about 70% of the time, depending on their color. In ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]'', the color scheme of the weathers seems to partially reflect this. 
**The colour for Sunny ([[Reimu Hakurei]]'s weather) is white, 
**The colour for Cloudy ([[Sakuya Izayoi]]'s) is grey,
**The colour for rainy (Sprinkle/Drizzle, [[Suika Ibuki]]/[[Marisa Kirisame]]'s weather) is blue, 
*They are all mentioned in the ''Perfect Memento in Strict Sense'' article. It's also said that the eyes turn red when an incident is about to occur: in all three present cases of "red-weather" this is verified. 
**[[Remilia Scarlet]]'s weather, "Heavy Fog", is red (like the Scarlet Mist in ''[[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]]''). 
**[[Tenshi Hinanawi]]'s weather, "Aurora" is likewise red (she caused the entire incident in ''Scarlet Weather Rhapsody'', in addition to the destruction of the [[Hakurei Shrine]]). 
**[[Yukari Yakumo]]'s weather, "Sunshower" is likewise red (she manipulated the border of the [[Netherworld]] to allow [[Yuyuko Saigyouji]] to steal spring in ''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]'').
*In ''[[Forbidden Scrollery]]'', Hieda no Akyuu claims that "purple" is a more pale version of red, meaning a typhoon will come soon.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Forbidden Scrollery]] Chapter 44&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Eika Ebisu'''|戎 瓔花|Ebisu Eika}} is the soul of a stillborn child and a god of fortune who resides at the riverbank of the [[Sanzu River]], Sai no Kawara. She appears as the Stage 1 midboss and [[Boss|boss]] in ''[[Wily Beast and Weakest Creature]]''.

==General Information==
Eika is the spirit of a ''mizuko'' (水子)- meaning a child that was either stillborn, or only lived for a short time. Like all such spirits, she exists in limbo at the [[Sanzu River#Sai no Kawara|Sai no Kawara]] and spends her time stacking stones into towers. Though Japanese folklore portrays the spirits' situation as tragic, Eika enjoys her work immensely and sees the Sai no Kawara as a "kingdom" where she and the other spirits can play freely. She's adored by her fellow spirits, and routinely arranges stone-stacking contests for their enjoyment.

===Personality===
She is described as being both cheerful and intelligent, though she also displays fierce bursts of emotion that one might expect from a young child. When the protagonists of ''[[Wily Beast and Weakest Creature]]'' knock over the stone towers while passing by, Eika is outraged on behalf of her fellow spirits and makes a threat on the protagonist's life. At the same time, she's also very flexible and quick to make the best of a bad outcome; once the protagonists leave, she casually accepts the situation and wastes no time in arranging a different type of contest instead.

===Abilities=== 

;Stacking stones well

Her ability is based on the mythology surrounding Sai no Kawara, in which mizuko such as Eika make stone towers in order to try and reach paradise.

==Character Design==
&lt;!--===Origin===
--&gt;
===Name===
Her full name is ''Eika Ebisu'' (戎 瓔花). The character "戎" (''Ebisu'') is one of several used for [[wikipedia:Ebisu_(mythology)|Ebisu]], one of the [[wikipedia:Seven_Gods_of_Fortune|Seven Gods of Fortune]], who presides over fishermen and luck. Ebisu was the first child of the creation gods [[wikipedia:Izanami|Izanami]] and [[wikipedia:Izanagi|Izanagi]], but was born without bones due to Izanami committing a transgression during the ritual of their union. Initially known as ''Hiruko'' (蛭子), meaning "leech child", the child was set adrift in a boat of reeds, and eventually grew to become Ebisu after washing ashore. "戎" is also used to refer to [[wikipedia:Emishi|the Ebisu (or 'Emishi')]], a former ethnic group of northern Japan with potential relation to the [[wikipedia:Ainu|Ainu]].

''Eika'' (瓔花) is spelled with the characters ''ei'' (瓔)- an uncommon character meaning "necklace made of precious stones"- and ''ka'' (花), meaning "flower". "瓔" also visually resembles the characters "王" (meaning "king" or "ruler") and "嬰" (from 嬰児 / ''eiji'', meaning "infant"), tying in to Eika's status as a "ruler" of infant ghosts. The character can also be read as ''you'', notably seen in a [[Spelling discrepancies|spelling discrepancy]] in [[Wily Beast and Weakest Creature]]'s demo release. Her name is read as "Eika" in the [[Wily Beast and Weakest Creature/Music|music room]] and her on-screen title graphic, and as "Youka" in the omake.txt and name graphic in the upper-left corner.

===Design===
Eika has a fluffy mass of light yellow hair with several thin braids trailing off of it, red eyes, and a noticeably darker skin tone than the majority of [[Touhou Project]] characters. She wears a white dress with red polka dots near the hems, red frills, and thin red tassels trailing off of the sleeves and waist. Both her hair and dress visually resemble a jellyfish, and the red tassels bear a resemblance to both a jellyfish's tendrils and to umbilical cords. She also has large earlobes, likely as a visual allusion to [[wikipedia:Kṣitigarbha|Jizo Bosatsu]] and [[wikipedia:Ebisu_(mythology)|Ebisu]].

Her color palette seems to be based off –to an extent– of ''[[Wikipedia:Turritopsis dohrnii|Turritopsis dohrnii]]'' (commonly known as the ''immortal jellyfish''), a species of small, biologically immortal jellyfish found in the Mediterranean Sea and in the waters of Japan. It is one of the few known cases of animals capable of reverting completely to a sexually immature, colonial stage after having reached sexual maturity as a solitary individual. The liner notes for her boss theme ''Jelly Stone'' make a reference to jellyfish – possibly this specific species in particular.

==Appearances==

[[File:Th17EikaSprite.png|frame|right|Eika's sprite in ''[[Wily Beast and Weakest Creature|WBaWC]]'']]
===Games===
;''Wily Beast and Weakest Creature''
Eika was hosting a stone stacking contest on the riverbed of Sai no Kawara with the children of the afterlife. However, the contest was ruined due to the heroines thrashing around, causing the stacked stones to fall over. Enraged, Eika attacks the heroines, but is ultimately defeated. After the heroines tell her their intentions, Eika snarkily says that going to [[Hell]] sounds about right for them.

==Additional Information==
*Eika is one of the few ''Touhou'' characters whose sprites in her debut game appearance aren't largely based on her in-game portrait. Though her pre-battle dialogue uses a set of 'sitting' sprites that match her portrait, she switches to a unique 'standing' set during the fight itself.
*In the [[Strange Creators of Outer World/Wily Beast and Weakest Creature Interview with ZUN|Strange Creators of Outer World interview]] about ''Wily Beast and Weakest Creature'', ZUN states that Eika's title purposely ties into [[Keiki Haniyasushin|Keiki's]] idolatry theme. This might be a nod to gods they're based on being siblings according to the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki genealogies.

Species: Soul of a stillborn child&lt;br /&gt;
Ability: Capable of stacking stones well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

A master at skillfully stacking stones.&lt;br /&gt;
Her stone-stacking technique is superb, and she serves as a sort of leader of the spirits of stillborn children at the Sai no Kawara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

She's also a god of fortune who's able to change simple, pointless work into something that's enjoyable and worth doing, and who can make the best out of any bad situation.&lt;br /&gt;
Her ever-cheery demeanor, bright intellect, and penchant for constantly holding exciting new events like stone-stacking contests makes her the Sai no Kawara's resident idol, beloved by all the children's spirits there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

She's utterly furious with the protagonists for ruining the latest stone-stacking contest, but actually, it was mostly the fault of the beast spirits who arrived from Hell.

{{nihongo|'''Eiki Shiki, Yamaxanadu'''|四季映姫・ヤマザナドゥ|Shiki Eiki Yamazanadu|extra=given name "Eiki", surname "Shiki"}} is one of the [[Yama]] who judge the dead and decide whether they go to [[Heaven]], [[Hell]], the [[Netherworld]], or get reincarnated. She currently resides in Hell. Whether it's because she simply has a habit of lecturing or because she genuinely wants others to change for the better, she's become well known in [[Gensokyo]] for lecturing anyone and everyone about their faults. The souls of the dead are brought to her by [[Komachi Onozuka]], who ferries them over the [[Sanzu River]] to [[Higan]]. However, not every soul makes it all the way across without being tired out from the journey or being extinguished by Komachi.

==General Information==
She first appeared in ''[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]'', where she served as final [[boss]] for most of the Story Mode scenarios and could be unlocked as a playable character. She later re-appeared as one of the stage 10 targets in ''[[Shoot the Bullet]]''.

===Personality===
As the Yama who judges people after they die, Eiki is impartial to anyone when lecturing them, whenever they are human or youkai. Since she is very preachy and is never mistaken about anything, this makes her hard to approach. Despite her stern attitude and seriousness at her job, Eiki has a teasing side, smiling even when revealing the shortcomings of the people she's lecturing. She's described as being polite and patient when lecturing.

===Abilities===
;Establishing as clear good and evil (black and white)
This is as literally stated. With this power, in order to hand down judgements, the charges that have been established once as clear good and evil cannot, no matter what measures the judged person takes, be overturned. The reason why [[Yukari Yakumo]] is not good at dealing with Eiki&lt;ref&gt;[[Seasonal Dream Vision/A Beautiful Flower Blooming Violet Every Sixty Years]]&lt;/ref&gt; is probably not just because she dislikes preaching, but also because the Yukari that loves chaos and disorder can be said to dislike things to be established as clear good and evil.

===Occupation===
[[File:GoMIllus-Shikieiki.jpg|thumb|180px||left|Eiki illustration in ''[[The Grimoire of Marisa]]'']]
Eiki is a [[yama]] who belongs to the [[Perfect_Memento_in_Strict_Sense/Yama|Ministry of Right and Wrong]] located at [[Hell]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'': [[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Yama|Yama's article]].&lt;/ref&gt; Although there are many yamas, Eiki is the one in charge of [[Gensokyo]]. She, like the other yamas, holds the [[Cleansed Crystal Mirror]] that lets them look into a person's past, learn anything they want to know about him/her, and then use that knowledge to make fair judgements.

Eiki does have work breaks, but even during these she doesn't pass up chances to lecture people in the hope that they will change for the better and so she won't have to send them to Hell. For people with particularly bad karma, she will go directly to that person to warn them, sometimes by exaggerating the punishment that they would receive. It's implied that [[youkai]] tend to avoid her because of this habit.

Eiki was not always the Yamaxanadu. According to Komachi in ''[[Oriental Sacred Place]]'', she was originally a [[wikipedia:Ksitigarbha|jizou statue]], who received enough faith to gain divine powers, and was promoted.

===Possessions===
;[[Rod of Remorse]]
Always in Eiki's possession, it can be said to be a rod or a piece of wood. Upon writing the charges on this rod, the weight of the rod changes according to the weight of the sins, and the number of times to beat the sinner is also decided, after which Eiki proceeds to do the beating. This is one of the necessary items for use by [[Yama]] for punishment. As explained in ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'', she carries this rod with her everywhere.

In the past, each rod was used for one person, and thrown away after its usage was finished. However, for the sake of the environment, it seems that they've been changed to use new material that can be erased and reused.

;[[Cleansed Crystal Mirror]]
This is also an item meant for Yama to perform judgement. When a sinner is reflected in the mirror, it reflects all of the sinner's past deeds, though it is tiring to use. It is a dreadful tool for which privacy is even less than worthless, but perhaps because it does not show up in Eiki's sprite, it has a tendency to be forgotten. It can be said that the mirror of the Yama can change shape as they please, but Eiki's mirror takes the form of a hand mirror.

It can even turn these deeds against the person in question, as shown in ''[[Shoot the Bullet]]'' when Eiki uses the [[spell card]] [[Shoot the Bullet/Spell Cards/Level 10#Spell Card 10 - 8|Judgement "Cleansed Crystal Judgement -Aya Shameimaru-"]] to pit [[Aya Shameimaru|Aya]] against herself. The "-Aya Shameimaru-" subscript in the card's name suggests that she can create other versions of this card for use against other characters.

==Character Design==
[[File:PMiSS sikieiki.jpg|thumb|180px|Eiki, as illustrated in ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'']]
===Origin===
Eiki is based on the Yama Kings, a Buddhist reinterpretation of the Hindu god Yama (Enma), influenced by the concept of an "afterlife bureaucracy" present in Chinese folk religion. Japanese folklore usually mentions ten kings, but elsewhere different number of yamas is occasionally mentioned, with some Chinese legends outright presenting it as a rank any suitably virtuous entity, [https://www2.ihp.sinica.edu.tw/file/2593BKcnwPR.pdf including humans], might acquire.

Her backstory is likely a nod to king Enma, the most prominent of the kings, being associated with bodhisattva Jizou, either outright as a [https://www.onmarkproductions.com/html/gongen-list-japan.html gongen] (manifestation), as a subordinate, or simply as a related afterlife deity. Jizou is also often described as preaching to still alive sinners to save them from torment in hell.

===Name===
Her full name is {{nihongo||四季映姫|Eiki Shiki}}; ''Eiki Shiki'' (using Western name order) would be her romanized name. The kanji for {{nihongo||映姫|Eiki}} literally means "reflection/projection/casting princess", while {{nihongo||四季|Shiki}} is the Japanese word for "the four seasons". Her {{nihongo||ヤマザナドゥ|Yamaxanadu}} title is considered to be a combination of [[wikipedia:Xanadu|Xanadu]] (an ancient palace of the Mongol warlord [[wikipedia:Kublai Khan|Kublai Khan]], which was later used as meaning a "Pleasure Palace" in a [[wikipedia:Kubla Khan|poem by Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]) and her status as Yama, and can mean something along the lines of "Yama of Paradise". This title can be read as "{{ruby-ja|閻魔楽園|ヤマザナドゥ}}", which has roughly the same meaning as the above. 

In the data files for ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'', {{nihongo||映姫|Eiki}} was misspelt with the kanji "{{lang|ja|映季}}"; the latter kanji means "season". This is a common mistake in the fanbase because the reading of "ki" in {{lang|ja|姫}} is rarely used, so [[wikipedia:Input method|IME]] commonly converts it into the former one.

===Design===
In ''[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]'''s official art, Eiki has blue eyes and green hair that is longer on the right side. She wears a dark blue, black and white dress with gold decorations and one ribbon on both sleeves. She wears a blue and white hat with a gold emblem in front and a red and white bow on the back; the emblem and bow are balanced equally. She also wears black shoes with a red bow on them, and frilly socks. Furthermore, there seems to be a pattern on her uniform that seems balanced and she carries the [[Rod of Remorse]], described above.

Her alternative outfit in ''Phantasmagoria of Flower View'' is the same as her usual outfit, but her hat and dress are red, and her white shirt is purple.

:{{Main|Phantasmagoria of Flower View/Story#Eiki's Story|l1=Phantasmagoria of Flower View Story}}
Eiki's role was to judge the souls that managed to cross the [[Sanzu River]], but unfortunately couldn't do any major work due to [[Komachi Onozuka]] slacking off in the face of the sheer mass of ghosts that were coming through to [[Gensokyo]]. Meanwhile, Eiki's interrupted by various residents because they were curious about the huge number of flowers blooming, and Eiki started lecturing them on what negative personalities they've got. She also later researches how many of those people have taken her advice on doing good deeds, in which many of them haven't. 

;[[Wily Beast and Weakest Creature]]
She instructs [[Kutaka Niwatari]] to test the protagonist for their strength before letting them into hell, she also relays to them via Kutaka that they should not trust the animal spirit possessing them, foreshadowing its betrayal.

Eiki Shiki appears in chapter 5 when Reimu goes to Higan to ask about Clownpiece being out of Hell and in Gensokyo and goes to meet Shiki Eiki to ask. Eiki Shiki suggests that Hecatia is letting Clownpiece escape from Hell but Eiki Shiki is confident about Reimu and tells her she only really needs to keep an eye on her.

;[[Yuyuko Saigyouji]] and [[Youmu Konpaku]]
According to [[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]], Yuyuko was appointed her position by the yama, therefore it can be assumed that Eiki outranks her (Yuyuko also refers to Eiki as "Eiki-Sama" in [[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]).  Yuyuko knows Eiki personally, as Eiki dropped by to push her to teach [[Youmu]] more in Youmu's ending in [[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]], which also seems to be the first time Youmu and Eiki met in person.

Kutaka is another of Eiki's subordinates, as confirmed in one of [[Kirisame Marisa|Marisa]]'s ''Wily Beast and Weakest Creature'' scenarios.

*In Eiki's [[spell card]]s, the background is [[wikipedia:The Last Judgment (Michelangelo)|''The Last Judgment'']] by Michelangelo.
*Based on her conversations with the many playable characters in ''[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]'', she is seen as a compassionate individual, though her conversations with [[Komachi Onozuka]] can seem quite harsh. Despite all this scolding, however, Komachi remains a slacker.
*She tells [[Yuuka Kazami]] to "scare humans" like a regular youkai and tells [[Reimu Hakurei]] to "exterminate youkai more." Both of these cases can be simplified to "do your job" and it showed she does not discriminate [[youkai]] and [[human]].
*The phrase "Eastern Judgement", {{nihongo||東方裁判|touhou saiban}}, in the title of Eiki's [[Phantasmagoria_of_Flower_View/Music#Eiki_Shiki.2C_Yamaxanadu.27s_theme|music theme]] is very similar to a Japanese term for the [[wikipedia:International Military Tribunal for the Far East|Tokyo Tribunal]], {{nihongo||東京裁判|Tokyo saiban}}. The end of World War II and the start of the ensuing tribunal took place 60 years before the events of ''Phantasmagoria of Flower View'', and this similarity in pronunciation is likely intentional.

| translation = '''Supreme Judge of Paradise'''&lt;br/&gt;
'''Eiki Shiki, Yamaxanadu'''

Species: [[Yama]]&lt;br/&gt;
Ability: Establishing things as clear good and evil


One of the gods that resides in hell and judges the deceased. She possesses ability to establish things as clear good and evil.  Her real name is Eiki Shiki, and the "Yamaxanadu" is a title that she carries in her job as a Yama.  Basically the title represents the place they're in charge of.


Unlike [[human]]s, she has a criteria of right and wrong in her own mind. Her judgement cannot be overturned by the deceased.  Her criteria is quite complicated, and the seriousness of the crimes factor in everything from why they occurred to the personal history of those involved.

The minimum requirement of lying to her, in order to appear as a good person, is not letting her discover that lie. If discovered it is a huge deduction.

Her usual routine is to find faults of the deceased and decide where they will be sent to: Hell, Heaven, or somewhere else. Due to her job, she tends to be somewhat moralistic.



It was when [[Komachi Onozuka|Komachi]] did not ferry the deceased to her that she noticed something was wrong in [[Gensokyo]].  Suspicious, she looked at Gensokyo only to find out that it was blanketed by flowers.

All kinds of flowers were blooming at the same time - spider lilies, sunflowers, lilies of the valley, lotus blossoms, and cherry blossoms.  As she was digesting this, both living humans and [[youkai]] attacked her, seething with anger.

These assaults immediately made her realize what was going on.&lt;br/&gt;
Now it is "that year", 60 years since the previous one.

All these flowers were possessed by spirits of the deceased, and the reason they weren't processed properly was because Komachi was being lazy.&lt;br/&gt;
Komachi, being too easygoing, only thought "ah, it's beautiful" even when the flowers were filling the whole place.

It's not like she can restore the flower-covered Gensokyo, but time will eventually bring it back to normal. There was little to no harm.

However, a human who's been charged with a crime is before her. With her pride, she couldn't let her pass through her place.

{{nihongo|'''Eirin Yagokoro'''|八意　永琳|Yagokoro Eirin}} is one of the antagonists of [[Imperishable Night]]. She's a medical genius from the [[Moon]], able to create even the [[Hourai Elixir]] with the help of Kaguya's power, the manipulation of eternity. She is living in exile in [[Gensokyo]] after choosing to stay with and devote herself to [[Kaguya Houraisan]] on Earth rather than take her back to the Moon. She was a very well-known figure on the Moon, having not only been instrumental in the founding of Lunar society with [[Lord Tsukuyomi]], but also being its leading medical mind and the person in charge of the Moon's emissaries to the Earth.

==General Information==
She first appeared as the Alternative Final Boss in ''[[Imperishable Night]]'', and she was stage 9 target in ''[[Shoot the Bullet]]''. She is also involved in ''[[Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom]]''.

===Personality===
Eirin is an enigmatic person surrounded by many mysteries and her answers regarding the mysteries about her are incoherent replies. She is generally a fairly pleasant person and is devoted to serving her ally, Kaguya, but she does not suffer fools gladly, and because of her incredibly high intelligence, she can come across as conceited, impatient and condescending at times to those not sharp enough to follow her explanations immediately. However, she also seems to lack general common sense, most likely due to her not living with humans. [[File:GoMIllus-Eirin.jpg|thumb|200px|Eirin illustrated in [[The Grimoire of Marisa]].]]

===Abilities===
;Making any drug
She can make all sorts of drug/medicines, from medicine for the ordinary cold to drugs that can manipulate dreams. As one would expect, she is not able to make medicines that would require a physically impossible process in order to produce, nor can she make the medicine if she does not have the ingredients. Although she did make the [[Hourai Elixir]], she made it using Kaguya's ability.

;Natural Genius
Eirin is said to be highly intelligent and considers other people to be less smart than her. Furthermore, the Yagokoro family is said to be a line of medicinal geniuses and even among them, Eirin is exceptionally intelligent. Due to this, Eirin is rarely understood by others.

;Immortality
It is not specified in her profile, but Eirin reveals to Yuyuko in the Netherworld Team's Good Ending of [[Imperishable Night]] that she has taken the medicine made with Kaguya's ability, and so cannot die. Yuyuko's response and further narration cement that this is referring to Eirin having become immortal, from the Hourai Elixir.

;Other abilities
Aside from her medical knowledge, Eirin seems to be very skilled in various forms of [[magic]]. For instance, in ''[[Imperishable Night]]'', she sealed the whole Earth preventing anything or anyone from reaching or leaving it. Additionally, she replaced the real Moon with a fake one that was able to mislead the heroines with an illusion. According to herself, doing this was "hardly" her most powerful spell, meaning that she is probably able to use other types of sorcery that are far stronger than this&lt;ref&gt;''[[Imperishable Night]]'' - Barrier Team's Scenario. &lt;br /&gt;
'''Reisen:''' ''Ah, you're talking about the moon? That's my master Eirin's most powerful spell. It makes this Earth into a giant, sealed chamber. Do you get it now?''&lt;br /&gt;

'''Eirin:''' ''Also, about that full moon-erasing spell. It's hardly my most powerful one.''&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Occupation===
After the events of ''[[Imperishable Night]]'', Eirin has begun using her knowledge of medicine to act as Gensokyo's premier pharmacist, selling medicines at [[Eientei]] ranging from sleep aids to various cures. You can visit her like you visit a normal doctor, and she can even prescribe medicine for obscure illnesses. Her medicines are well known to work with no side effects, though youkai medicine and human medicine must never be mixed together. It's reasonable to believe her medicines come from the Moon or are developed with Lunar technology. The medicine is not only effective, but fairly priced. Fortunately, Eirin is not fussy about payment; she will most likely wait until you pay her. Still, it is believed that Eirin may have another reason for starting this business other than profit.

===Possessions===
;Bow and Arrow
Eirin wields a bow and arrow. Presumably, she uses it for spellcards.

==Backstory==
A long time ago, Eirin was the Sage of the [[Moon]]; with her high intelligence and the aid of the former Princess of the Moon, Kaguya, she created the [[Hourai Elixir]] and gave it to her. As a result, Kaguya was exiled to Earth as a punishment for drinking the elixir. A few years later, Kaguya had been allowed to return to the moon and, along with other Lunarians, Eirin was sent to Earth as an emissary from the Moon. Eirin felt sorry for Kaguya because she herself wasn't punished even though she was the 
one who made the elixir. Her desire for redemption was so strong that she was ready to do anything for Kaguya, and so she killed all the other emissaries and decided to live on Earth with Kaguya as her own punishment.

After living a few hundred years hidden in the [[Bamboo Forest of the Lost|Bamboo Forest]] of [[Gensokyo]], her whereabouts were discovered by the Moon, and led to the [[Imperishable Night|Eternal Night Incident]], but at the time the incident was resolved, she came to know that even if she did not try to hide the Moon, the Envoys of the Moon wouldn't be able to come here. She has been living as a resident of Gensokyo thereafter.

==Character Design==
[[File:PMiSS eirin.jpg|thumb|200px|Eirin illustrated in ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'']]
===Origin===
Eirin might be based on {{nihongo|[[wikipedia:Omoikane (Shinto)|Ame no Yagokoro Omoikane no Mikoto]]|天八意思兼命}}, the god who thought of the plan to lure [[wikipedia:Amaterasu|Amaterasu]] out of hiding. This can be seen by her [[Imperishable Night/Spell Cards/Stage 6A#Spell Card 132|spell card]], and by the correlation between Eirin's sharp intellect and Omoikane's. (Takami-Musubi is also very strongly associated with intellectual facilities.) The interrelationships of various lunar figures presents a more interesting situation. Eirin is distantly related to the Watatsuki sisters, both based on mythology. In the [[Cage in Lunatic Runagate/Third Chapter|third chapter]] of ''[[Cage in Lunatic Runagate]]'', [[Watatsuki no Toyohime]] mentions that Eirin's participation was critical to the founding of the lunar capital, and that she was older even than Tsukuyomi. Omoikane is the son of Takami-Musubi, one of the great gods that summoned Izanagi and Izanami into existence, but it's unclear whether Omoikane was born before the creation of the Japanese islands, which also saw the births of Amaterasu, Tsukuyomi, and Susanoo. Regardless of whether she is "meant to be" Omoikane, Eirin clearly draws on Omoikane in many ways.

===Name===
Her full name is {{nihongo|''Eirin Yagokoro''|八意　永琳}}. The characters for {{nihongo||八意|Yagokoro}} literally means "eight minds" and {{nihongo||永琳|Eirin}}, "eternal jewel". The number 8 in Japanese culture signifies the sacred and the infinite, and is often used indefinitely to mean "many" or "countless" (as in the [[Eight Million Gods]]). ''Gokoro'' is an ancient reading for {{lang|ja|意}}, which could indicate something about heart or mind. So her whole name could mean "Intelligence of eternally clear brightness over infinitely extended area", referring her to be the "Mind of [[God]]". It is revealed in ''[[Silent Sinner in Blue]]'' that "Eirin" is merely her earth name, her true [[Lunarian]] first name being unpronounceable to the [[impurity|impure]] earthling tongue. Regardless of "Yagokoro" in both cases. She is strongly implied to be [[wikipedia:Omoikane (Shinto)|Omoikane]].

===Design===
Eirin has dark grey eyes, long silver hair, has a large braid on her back and carries a strange pair of bow and arrow. Her clothing is red and blue and is covered with constellation patterns. She also wears something similar to a nurse's cap.

Eirin's clothing has [[wikipedia:I Ching|trigrams]] (broken and solid Yin/Yang lines) lining the bottom hem. They appear to be the complete set of trigrams used in [[wikipedia:Feng shui|Feng Shui]], and match the set of trigrams on the [[Hakkero]].

==Appearances==
===Games===
;''Imperishable Night''
[[File:Th08EirinSprite.png|frame|Eirin's sprite in ''IN'']]
During the events of ''[[Imperishable Night]]'', Eirin attempted to seal the passage between the Earth and [[Moon]], which opens every full moon, by casting a spell that would seal the Earth inside a chamber (similar to a Chinese folktale about a paradise found inside a pot). She only meant to do this to protect both Kaguya and [[Reisen Udongein Inaba|Reisen]] so that the emissaries coming from the Moon wouldn't be able to reach them, but this did not go unnoticed by the various [[Youkai]] in Gensokyo who enjoy the moonlight.

&lt;Insert Summary&gt;--&gt;

;''Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom''
Eirin is involved in the backstory of ''[[Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom]]''. The [[Moon]] habitants decided to make an invasion to Gensokyo with the intent of [[Purity|purifying]] it. [[Moon rabbit]]s and mechanical spiders are razing the place and leaving a lifeless Earth. Gensokyo's [[human]]s can't fight by themselves, because a simple error means death, and it also looks like the youkai for some reason can't interfere with the purification, but Eirin planned ahead for such event and made a medicine that allows the user to see the close future. She sends Reisen to give the medicine to [[Reimu Hakurei]], [[Marisa Kirisame]], and [[Sanae Kochiya]] and resolve the incident. This medicine is the tool that allows the Pointdevice gameplay mode, in which the player cannot get hit once.

===Spin-offs===
[[File:Th135Eirin.png|frame|Eirin in ''HM'']]
;''Shoot the Bullet''
In ''[[Shoot the Bullet]]'', [[Aya Shameimaru]] encountered Eirin on [[stage]] 9 and took photos of her [[danmaku]].

;''Hopeless Masquerade''
Eirin made a background cameo appearance in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'' on the [[Human Village]] stage. She is seen sitting on a bench with [[Tewi Inaba]], [[Kaguya Houraisan]] and [[Reisen Udongein Inaba]] drinking something.

===Literature===
;Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red
{{main|Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red/Eirin|l1=Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red Article and Interview: Eirin}}
Eirin has created a new medicine called the Kochoumugan (Butterfly Dream Pill), which guarantees that one will have a pleasant dream. She says that since the youkai of Gensokyo rarely suffer from physical ailments, she began developing medicine for spiritual ailments instead. This particular medicine is ancient, but humans who took it in the past often found their dreams too enjoyable and never returned from the dream world, so Eirin has weakened its potency and made it safe to use. She also has a variety which causes nightmares instead of pleasant dreams.

In the interview, Eirin remarks that only a few people have come to buy the pill, even though it was a featured article in Aya's newspaper. Aya admits she doesn't have many readers. She is curious who is buying the medicine; Eirin is initially reluctant to say, but then reveals that it was [[Alice Margatroid]]. Aya mentions that she tried the pill herself, but found the dream uninteresting. Eirin suggests that she try Kochoumugan Nightmare Type (a [[Shoot the Bullet/Spell Cards/Level 9#Spell Card 64|scene]] in ''[[Shoot the Bullet]]'').

==Relationships==
;[[Kaguya Houraisan]] (Fellow Exile, Mistress)
Kaguya is Eirin's master and friend. She made the Hourai Elixir for Kaguya which resulted in her banishment. Feeling regretful, when she was sent to Earth to bring her back on the Moon, she killed the other emissaries and helped Kaguya with hiding herself. Now she serves Kaguya faithfully at Eientei.

;[[Reisen Udongein Inaba]] (Apprentice)
Eirin's servant. Eirin has employed Reisen's telepathic abilities to gain intelligence on the Lunar capital. She also sends Reisen to the Human Village to sell her medicine.

;[[Tewi Inaba]] (Allied Earth Rabbit)
Tewi made a deal with Eirin to defend Eientei in exchange for Eirin imparting her knowledge to the rabbits. Thus Eirin is an ally, employer and teacher to Tewi and Tewi appropriately addresses her as Master. Eirin realizes Tewi's importance to Eientei due to her control over the rabbits and despite Tewi's pranks, knows that Tewi is there whenever they really need her, should the circumstance arise.

;[[Sakuya Izayoi]] (Unknown)
According to Eirin's profile, Eirin was very surprised to see Sakuya during the events of Imperishable Night. Though what relationship they have are unknown since only Eirin knows the reason why.

;[[Watatsuki no Toyohime]] &amp; [[Watatsuki no Yorihime]] (Former Student, Distant Relative)
Eirin was a teacher to both Toyohime and Yorihime. They both respect Eirin with much admiration even after Eirin became a fugitive. They both are also distantly related to Eirin through marriage to their unnamed husbands (one of the Watatsuki sisters was the wife of Eirin's grandnephew, while the other one was married to their son&lt;ref name="CiLR1"&gt;[[Cage in Lunatic Runagate/First Chapter]]&lt;/ref&gt;),

;[[Lord Tsukuyomi]] (Relative, Lunar Capital Co-Founder)
Not much was known how close they are, however they both founded the lunar capital together, so they could have been in good terms. It's unknown if their relationship remains the same after Eirin's desertion.

;[[Medicine Melancholy]]
After learning of Medicine from Reisen, Eirin goes to the Hill of the Nameless to meet her. Eirin takes an interest of her thanks to her poison abilities.

===Minor Relationships===
;[[Alice Margatroid]] (Recurring Customer)
Alice regularly purchases the Butterfly Dream Pill from Eirin.

==Additional Information==
*Eirin's profile states that she killed the other messengers sent with her. Kaguya's profile describes these messengers as "emissaries". Later official works would state that moon [[rabbit]]s are trained as lunar emissaries, and it is unconfirmed if any of the emissaries were Lunarians. Given that rabbits are viewed merely as tools by the Lunarians, this may explain why the severity of murdering the other emissaries isn't emphasized whenever Eirin's crime of helping the princess comes up. Eirin has also made it clear in both [[Cage in Lunatic Runagate]] and chapter 2 in [[Silent Sinner in Blue]] that she has no qualms with killing moon rabbits should situation make her go to such lengths.
*Eirin has a [[Spell Card]] named "Apollo 13" after the [[wikipedia:Apollo 13|aborted third American moon mission]] launched in April 1970. The spell card's spell sign is "Curse of the Heavens", and seems to imply that it was Lunarian magic, not mechanical failure, that critically damaged the spacecraft and forced it to abandon its lunar landing so as to forestall the "invasion". It's also stated that the Lunarians know why the number 13 is cursed. Eirin in ''Silent Sinner in Blue'' reveals that the Apollo series failed because the sun ("Apollo") is incompatible with the back side of the moon, and [[Cage in Lunatic Runagate/Second Chapter|Cage in Lunatic Runagate's 2nd chapter]] mentions Lunarian technology while talking about the humans' failure to establish a base on the moon, implying Lunarian sabotage.
*Eirin had recently developed a medicine called Kochoumugan (Butterfly Dream Pill), which guarantees the person who takes it will have a pleasant dream once they fall asleep. The medicine was featured in an article in the [[Bunbunmaru Newspaper]], but still remains fairly unpopular (mostly due to the fact that the paper itself isn't too popular). There is one customer, [[Alice Margatroid]], who has returned numerous times to purchase the medicine however, although the reasons why were never disclosed.
*In Tibetan Buddhism, the bow held in the right hand with an arrow in the left (as Eirin holds them) is a symbol of wisdom as a means of projecting method or skillful means.
*The bow and the arrow are a possible reference to the huntress and Greek moon goddess Artemis (sister of Apollo; In ''[[Imperishable Night]]'', ZUN made a joke about Apollo being the sun god, so he surely knows about Artemis). Artemis (or her bow) sometimes represents the crescent moon, symbol of full maturity in the cycle of life (it suits Eirin very well).
**Artemis is often assimilated to Selene (the personification of the moon), which is the root of Selenium, a non-metal antioxidant sometimes used as a medicine but toxic in large quantity to human beings. Antioxidants are known to improve life expectancy.
**Ursa Major, one of the constellations on Eirin's clothes, was originally Callisto, a servant of Artemis.
**It is also confirmed that ZUN is aware of the bow representing the crescent moon. In [[Cage in Lunatic Runagate/Fifth Chapter|Cage in Lunatic Runagate Chapter 5]], Yukari is unable to see the crescent moon due to a storm, and wonders if it's because there is no one on the moon who wields a bow anymore.
*In Chinese mythology, Houyi was a god of archery banished from heaven. He was married to [[Chang'e]], Kaguya's Chinese equivalent. According to legends, he received the last two immortal elixirs from Xi Wangmu of Kunlun mountains in the west. Chang'e drank them both, who then ascended to the moon.

'''Eirin Yagokoro'''

Species: [[Lunarian]]&lt;br /&gt;
Abilities: Making any drug. Natural Genius.

She's a person from the [[moon]]. That means she's an alien. She has lived on the Earth for a long time. Her relationship with [[Kaguya Houraisan|Kaguya]] dates back to their days on the moon.

The Yagokoro family is a line of medicinal geniuses that have been living on the moon for some time. Even among them, Eirin is exceptionally intelligent. She is much smarter than humans, which makes her rarely understood.

In truth, she has power well beyond that of Kaguya's. She saves her power and maintains it at a lower level out of respect for Kaguya.

Long ago, Eirin was one of a party of messengers who were sent to bring [[Kaguya Houraisan|Kaguya]] back to the moon; the crime for which she was exiled to Earth had been forgiven. For some reason, she helped Kaguya kill all the other messengers instead. To ensure that the earthlings who lived with Kaguya would remain silent, she bribed them with the Hourai Elixir. The elixir had the power to make people immortal. None of those earthlings consumed the elixir, however, and died shortly afterwards.

It was later discovered that they were murdered.

More detail is available in [[Kaguya Houraisan|Kaguya]]'s profile.

Eirin is very surprised to see [[Sakuya Izayoi|Sakuya]], but only Eirin knows the reason why.

'''Elis''' is a [[devil]] of some kind that [[Reimu Hakurei]] encounters while in [[Makai]]'s [[Ruins of Vina]] during ''[[Highly Responsive to Prayers]]''. Since she has no official character profile and exchanges no dialogue with Reimu, nothing else is known about this enemy.

==Character Design==
===Name===
Her name is displayed in-game as ''Elis''. The name "Elis" comes from [[wikipedia:Elijah|Elijah]], [[wikipedia:Hebrew|Hebrew]] for "The Lord is my God", specifically a dialect form from [[wikipedia:Welsh language|Welsh]] and [[wikipedia:Middle English|Middle English]]. The name may also refer to [[wikipedia:Eris (mythology)|Eris]], the goddess of chaos, strife, and discord in Greek mythology. Probably a coincidence, there is an ancient district called "[[wikipedia:Elis|Elis]]" in southern Greece. However, her name is most likely a reference to a character named "Elis" from a [[wikipedia:Tankōbon|tankoubon]] manga called {{nihongo|''Babaroa Ehon''|ばばろあえほん}} by [[wikipedia:Izumi Takemoto|Izumi Takemoto]], a favorite manga artist of [[ZUN]]'s whose works are referenced in various places throughout the ''[[Touhou Project]]'' series.

===Design===
[[File:Th01Elis2.png|frame|left|Elis as a bat.]]
Elis' sprite in ''Highly Responsive to Prayers'' shows that she has purple eyes, has blond hair with a large red bow, and that she has a wand topped with a star in her left hand. She wears a white shirt with a red bowtie under her purple vest and a long red skirt with strange purple markings along its hem. She also has pointed elf-like ears, a red star mark on her face, and what seems to be a secondary red hair accessory near her large bow. Additionally, Elis has large, purple bat wings and has the ability to turn herself into a bat.

Elis is one of the few [[PC-98]] characters whose hair and eyes are not the same color. The only other PC-98 characters who share this trait are [[Konngara]] and [[SinGyoku]]'s third form. This is due to the 16-color limit the [[PC-98]] has.

==Relationships==
===Minor Relationships===
;Shinki
[[Shinki]] is the creator of [[Makai]] and everything within it. In light of this, Shinki may also have created Elis.

==Additional Information==
*Elis and [[Kikuri]] share the same theme called "Magic Mirror".
*The background music for Makai stages 11 to 14 is called "Oriental Magician". This would later become one of [[Marisa Kirisame]]'s titles.
**Elis is also the only character alongside Marisa and [[Yuuka]] to ever use a wand in the series.
*Elis is one of three characters that can transform into a bat, with the other two being [[Remilia]] and [[Flandre]].
**Elis' bat form can take damage, however and it seems she willfully changes form in order to shoot danmaku. Remilia and Flandre don't turn into their bat form unless a bomb is used against them, in which case the form grants them temporary invulnerability. 
*Elis is the first boss in the series to have the iconic [[wikipedia:Star of David|Star of David]] [[wikipedia:Magic circle|magic circle]] present around her during certain attacks.
*[[Kurumi]], a vampire character introduced later in the [[PC-98]] series, bears some resemblance to her.
*Elis' character title, "Innocence Devil", seems to be referenced in the title of [[Gengetsu]]'s theme, "Cute Devil ~ Innocence", from ''[[Lotus Land Story]]''.
*Along with her name being a reference to ''Elis'' from [[wikipedia:Izumi Takemoto|Izumi Takemoto's]] {{nihongo|''Babaroa Ehon''|ばばろあえほん}}, her facial star mark might also be a reference to another of Takemoto's characters, ''[https://imgur.com/a/tOiWhrB Orunishiki Yukizasa]'', from {{nihongo|''Sayori na Parallel''|さよりなパラレル}}.
*The pattern on Elis' skirt may be inspired by the patterns on the dresses of many ''[[wikipedia:Shin Megami Tensei|Shin Megami Tensei]]'' demons, especially Titania, whose hair ornament seems to have inspired Elis' hair ornament. [https://imgur.com/a/F0hWGYU Comparison].
**The location Elis' is fought in, the [[Ruins of Vina]] (ヴィナの廃墟), is directly inspired by the location were demons are born, the Sea of Binah (ビナーの海), from the ''Shin Megami Tensei'' series. 
***[[wikipedia:Binah (Kabbalah)|Binah]] is the third sephira on the [[wikipedia:Kabbalah|Kabbalastic]] [[wikipedia:Sefirot|Sephiroth (Tree of Life)]] representing knowledge and wisdom.
****Due to Elis' connection with ''Shin Megami Tensei'' and [[wikipedia:Judaism|Jewish]] mysticism, she might be related to [[Sariel]] (who also has connections to Judaism and ''Shin Megami Tensei'') in some way. Perhaps Elis is a servant or underling to Sariel in a way similar to how most stage 5 bosses serve final bosses in later ''[[Touhou Project]]'' games.

'''Ellen''' ({{lang|ja|エレン}} ''Eren'') is an eternally young witch who makes her appearance during ''[[Phantasmagoria of Dim.Dream]]''. She lives longer than the average human (it's possible that she is immortal), but most memories of her life completely leave her mind in blocks at a time, making her as childish as she looks. It's assumed that she is not a [[human]].

==Character Design==
===Origin===
Ellen is not ZUN's original character but a parody of one of the heroines of {{nihongo||はたらきもの|Hatarakimono|lit. "Hard Worker"}}, a manga by [[wikipedia:Izumi Takemoto|Izumi Takemoto]], full name {{nihongo|Ellen Fuwafuwaatama (fluffy-head) Aureus|エレン・ふわふわ頭・オーレウス}}. In her ending, when she wants her new store's name to be "Fuwafuwa Ellen's Magic Shop", in reference to this. Sokrates is also based on this manga ([[ZUN]] notes that Ellen's clothing style and the "age" where cats were pets don't really match up, so the cat should probably be named "Archimedes" instead).

===Name===
"Ellen" is a very common Western feminine first name. It is of Greek origin, and the meaning of it is "sun ray, shining light"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thinkbabynames.com/meaning/0/Ellen Think Baby Names - Ellen].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Design===
Ellen's design is a short character with long blond hair and a red-and-white dress. She wears a red bow in her hair and is always seen in the company of Sokrates, her pet cat. Her alternate outfit shows all red parts in black.

==Relationships==
;Sokrates
[[Minor Characters#Sokrates|Sokrates]] is Ellens pet [[cat]] who can be seen on her shoulder almost the time.

==Additional Information==
[[File:Th123 marisa-ellen.png‎|thumb|right|One of [[Marisa Kirisame|Marisa]]'s alternate color schemes in ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]'']]
*Ellen appears on the cover of ''[[Phantasmagoria of Dim.Dream]]'' along with all the other characters in that game.
*Ellen's outfit may have been the inspiration for Marisa's outfit later on in the [[Windows]] series. Her alternate outfit is even black.
**One of [[Marisa Kirisame|Marisa's]] palettes in ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]'' resembles Ellen.
*Her first gauge attack may have been the predecessor of [[Sakuya Izayoi]]'s Killing Doll.

{{nihongo|'''Elly'''|エリー|Erī}} is a [[PC-98]] character whose role is being the [[gatekeeper]] of [[Mugenkan]], which is on the border between the [[Fantasy World]] and the [[Gensokyo|real world]]. It's so rare that people come there that she is rather surprised when both [[Reimu Hakurei]] and [[Marisa Kirisame]] show up one after another, and she fails miserably to stop either of them from entering. She blames it on the long time it has been since she last fought as she says she's really strong. She is the third stage boss of ''[[Lotus Land Story]]''.

==Character Design==
===Name===
Her only known name is {{nihongo|''Elly''|エリー}}, which is a female given name in Danish and German. 

===Design===
In ''[[Lotus Land Story]]'''s official art, Elly has yellow eyes, yellow hair, and wears a pink hat with a red ribbon. She also wears a dark red and pink dress and carries a scythe.

==Appearances==
;''Lotus Land Story''
:{{Main|Lotus Land Story/Story#Main Scenario|l1=Lotus Land Story: Story}}
At the time when the main character fights Elly, she says she's the guard of [[Mugenkan]]. She also says to either [[Reimu Hakurei]] or [[Marisa Kirisame]] (depending on who you choose to play has) that the opposite person has already entered Mugenkan and vice versa. She was defeated by either the two before the player has met Elly. She states that she has not fought for a long time before this event.

==Relationships==
Since she states that she rarely sees anyone coming to [[Mugenkan]], she may be a lonely character. However, her mistress appears to be [[Yuuka Kazami]], but it's unknown what kind of relation they've got.

==Additional Information==
[[File:Th04EllyScoreScreen.png|thumb|150px|Elly on the score screen of ''[[Lotus Land Story]]'']]
*She is the only boss in the series to start out invincible for an extended length of time.
*Elly's appearance may be inspired by appearance of Ankou from Megami Tensei.&lt;ref&gt;[https://megamitensei.fandom.com/wiki/Ankou Ankou]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Elly's scythe throwing attack may be inspired by Kamaitachi.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tyz-yokai.blog.jp/archives/1010653527.html Kamaitachi]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Elly is the only character in the whole series to use tiles as [[danmaku]].
*Elly appears on the score screen of ''[[Lotus Land Story]]'' and is one of the few [[PC-98]] characters who has a full in-game portrait; however, the colouring is in monochrome.
*Since other than [[Reimu Hakurei]] and [[Marisa Kirisame]], Elly has not fought for a long time. There might be a possibility that [[Kurumi]] (who appears to be the guard of the [[Lake of Blood]]) has defeated all intruders until both Reimu and Marisa came.

{{nihongo|'''Eternity Larva'''|エタニティラルバ|Etanitiraruba}} is a [[fairy]] embodying the growth, rebirth, and metamorphosis of insects.

==General Information==
Eternity appeared as the Stage 1 midboss and [[Boss]] in ''[[Hidden Star in Four Seasons]]''.

===Personality===
Eternity Larva has an extremely gentle personality. Her playfulness is no different from other fairies. Whenever something is happening, she'll head over to play. 

As a butterfly fairy, she greatly dislikes the cold. She is most active during the summer and becomes dormant during the winter.

===Abilities===
;Scattering scales
Her ability refers to the feature of most [[wikipedia:Lepidoptera|Lepidoptera]] of having scales covering their bodies and wings. The wings, head, and parts of the thorax and abdomen of butterflies and moths are covered with minute scales which give them an extraordinary variety of colors and patterns. Most scales are lamellar, or blade-like.

Eternity uses her scales as projectiles in [[danmaku]] patterns, as well as smokescreens.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Visionary Fairies in Shrine]]'' - Chapter 15&lt;/ref&gt;

;Controlling berserk lifeforce
An ability that Larva awakened after the [[Hidden Star in Four Seasons|Four Seasons incident]]. After using [[Clownpiece]]'s torch to make her own lifeforce go out of control, she used it to instantly change the wintery surroundings into a summer scenery, complete of warm sun and palm trees.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Visionary Fairies in Shrine]]'' - Chapter 9.5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character Design==
===Origin===
[[Okina Matara]]'s [[Hidden Star in Four Seasons/Story/Cirno's Extra|speculation]] suggests that Eternity may have been inspired by the story of the Tokoyo god. According to the ''[[wikipedia:Nihon Shoki|Nihon Shoki]]'', in 7th century Japan, a group of villagers formed a cult to worship an insect as the Tokoyo god ({{lang|ja|常世神}}, ''Tokoyo no Kami''), or "the god of the everlasting world".&lt;ref name="tokoyo"&gt; {{cite web|author=Nan-Yao Su|title=Tokoyo no Kami: A Caterpillar Worshipped by a Cargo Cult in Ancient Japan|publisher=American Entomologist, Volume 60, Issue 3, 1 |date=July 2014 |pages= 182–188 |access-date=2022-06-16|url= https://doi.org/10.1093/ae/60.3.182 |language= English}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is commonly believed that the insect was in fact a swallowtail caterpillar, which may explain Eternity's basis as swallowtail butterfly fairy.

===Name===
Her full name is Eternity Larva ({{lang|ja|エタニティラルバ}}). ''Eternity'' may signify her theme of metamorphosis and rebirth, while ''Larva'' is the juvenile life stage of [[wikipedia:Holometabolism|holometaboulous]] insects like moths and butterflies. Considering Eternity is probably based on ''Tokoyo no kami'', her name is probably a reflection of her origin as said kami. The term ''Tokoyo'' itself was used to refer to a far-away place where people would live eternally in prosperity and wealth, which could mean that the name ''Eternity'' might be a refference to that "eternal" land. In the demo of ''Hidden Star in Four Seasons'', her name was given as both ''Etarnity Larva'' in-game and ''Etanity Larva'' in the omake; both being more direct transliterations of {{lang|ja|エタニティ}} (eternity). These were corrected in the full version.

===Design===
Eternity has peach-colored eyes and short light blue hair. She is modeled after an [[Wikipedia:Papilio xuthus|Asian swallowtail]], having a pair of very large black and yellow wings, spotted with bits of blue and purple and a large two-pronged yellow [[wikipedia:osmeterium|osmeterium]] on her head which is a defensive organ found on all [[wikipedia:Papilionidae|Swallowtail butterfly]] larvae. She wears a black shirt with black and yellow swallowtail-inspired sleeves and collar, a line of blue spots down the left side, and a large green leaf that encompasses her torso, resembling a pupa.  She wears a light green skirt showing two thin irregular black rings and one ring of white spots of various alternating sizes at the edge. Eternity wears a crown of leaves atop her head.  She does not wear any footwear.

==Appearances==
===Games===
;''Hidden Star in Four Seasons''
[[File:Th16LarvaSprite.png|frame|Eternity Larva's sprite in ''HSiFS'']]
Due to the incident in ''[[Hidden Star in Four Seasons]]'', Eternity goes berserk alongside all the other fairies. Overwhelmed with power, she battles the player in the skies at the height of summer but is promptly defeated.

In [[Cirno]]'s Extra Stage scenario, it is revealed that Cirno used the door on Eternity's back to re-enter Ushirodo-no-Kuni and challenge [[Okina Matara]] to a rematch. Somehow, this resulted in Cirno drawing on the power of ''doyou'', the border between seasons, which ultimately contributed to Okina's defeat. As it was Eternity's door that led to this result, Okina speculates that Eternity may actually be a Tokoyo god, one of Okina's enemies, and wonders if it was a coincidence.

===Literature===
;''Visionary Fairies in Shrine''
Larva appears in chapter 8 of [[Visionary Fairies in Shrine]], where Cirno uses her to win a bug-catching competition against [[Sunny Milk]], [[Luna Child]], and [[Star Sapphire]]. After playing with them, Larva tells the three fairies about the events of [[Hidden Star in Four Seasons]] as Cirno explained them to her.

In chapter 9, the three fairies coincidentally find Larva's underground vacation home in the [[Forest of Magic]], and invite her to the "Deep Winter Red-hot Fire Festival" they organized for the day after. Larva therefore goes to the festival, where she meets [[Clownpiece]] for the first time and reveals the newly aquired power of Clownpiece's torch, that after the Four Seasons incident is now able to make life force go berserk.

==Relationships==
;[[Cirno]]
Eternity and Cirno are implied to have known each other before the events of ''Hidden Star in Four Seasons'', as Eternity notices Cirno's tan before they fight to see who the summer belongs to. &lt;ref&gt; ''[[Hidden Star in Four Seasons]]'' - [[Hidden Star in Four Seasons/Story/Cirno's Scenario|Cirno Scenario]] &lt;/Ref&gt; Eternity also appears in Cirno's ending.

==Additional Information==
*When Okina Matara wonders if Eternity is actually the Tokoyo god, she states that the Tokoyo god is one of her enemies. This may allude to the fact that the cult of the Tokoyo god was brought to an end when the leader of the cult was arrested and executed by an official named Hata no Kawakatsu.&lt;ref name="tokoyo" /&gt; Later, Hata no Kawakatsu would occasionally be equated with Matara-jin due to their similar divine natures as gods of the performing arts.
*Eternity Larva appears on the demo CD cover of ''[[Hidden Star in Four Seasons]]''.

Eternity Larva&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Species: Fairy&lt;br /&gt;
Ability: Capable of scattering scales&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

A swallowtail butterfly fairy.&lt;br /&gt;
But with that said, she doesn't just embody grown butterflies, but also caterpillars and chrysalids;&lt;br /&gt;
she can be said to be a fairy embodying insect growth, rebirth, and metamorphosis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Like Cirno, she's stronger than usual due to some strange force. She's in berserk mode, basically.&lt;br /&gt;
Fairies typically go berserk during most incidents anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Her regular personality is extremely gentle-- no matter where a fight breaks out, she'll head over&lt;br /&gt;
to play with a few power items in hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Apparently when she senses danger, she spews danmaku and a foul stench from her antennae.

{{nihongo|'''Fairy Maids'''|妖精メイド|Yōseimeido}} are the maids (excluding [[Sakuya Izayoi]]) who work in [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]]. There are thought to at least be 28 of them.

==Character Design==

===Name===
They are officially referred to as ''Fairy Maids'' ({{ruby-ja|妖精|ようせい}}{{lang|ja|メイド}}). None of these maids however are given a specific name including the three that traveled to the [[Moon]] alongside Remilia and Sakuya in ''[[Silent Sinner in Blue]]''.

==Relationships==
;Residents of the [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]]
[[Remilia Scarlet]] is the fairy maid's mistress whom which they primarily serve, as well as [[Flandre Scarlet]] whom they presumably serve as well and [[Patchouli Knowledge]] that can be seen sometimes serving. [[Hong Meiling]], [[Koakuma]] and [[Sakuya Izayoi]] are their fellow employees, where Sakuya is also their superior.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Additional Information==
* They're mentioned often by the residents of Scarlet Devil Mansion whenever the word [[fairy]] comes up.
* The same three fairy maids who travelled with Reimu's party to the [[Moon]] in ''[[Touhou Bougetsushou]]'' made a brief reappearance five years later in Chapter 21 of ''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]''

These mysterious group of spheres can be found in the [[World of Fantasies]] where they seem to have been blocking [[Reimu Hakurei]]'s way in the ''[[Story of Eastern Wonderland]]'', so she must fight them to get past. They are believed to be a [[gatekeeper]] of some sort and are able to change their physical appearance. Since they have no profile, no official names, and exchange no dialogue with Reimu, little is known about them. It is unclear if they are even living beings, a material made of stones, or some kind of machine. It may be regarded as a generic boss and unimportant. 

==Character Design==
===Name=== 
The name "Five Magic Stones" or "The 5 Magic Stones" is often used by the western community, due to their appearance. The name maybe abbreviated to "FMS". However, the Japanese fans rarely use this name, simply referring to them as {{nihongo|''[[Story of Eastern Wonderland|SoEW]] 3rd Stage Boss''|封魔録三面ボス}}. If "Five Magic Stones" was to be translated to Japanese literally, it could be translated to {{nihongo|"５つの魔法石"||Itsutsu no Mahou-seki}}, {{nihongo|"５つの魔石"||Itsutsu no maseki}} or {{nihongo|"五魔石"||GoMaSeki}}.

Another notable name regarding the Five Magic Stones amongst the Japanese community is {{nihongo|"[[Cannon]]"|砲台|Houdai}}, since it's able to use cannons.

===Design===
[[File:5magicstones.PNG|thumb|right|200px|Five Magic Stones (1st, 2nd, and 3rd form from top to bottom.)]]
In the ''[[Story of Eastern Wonderland]]'', the Five Magic Stones are 5 grey spherical orbs on stands which have red wiggly lines around them. They are on a grey platform, which is known to be on the same body of the spheres because it contains 24 laser [[cannon]]s that can fire. There seems to be the hiragana character {{nihongo||[[wiktionary:ろ|ろ]]|ro}} on the covers that are visible when the laser cannons aren't in use. When the boss battle starts, their appearances change by the following:
:''Form #1:'' Sphere 2 and 4 turn white.
:''Form #2:'' 3 spheres remaining. Sphere 1 and 5 turn red.
:''Form #3:'' 1 remaining sphere. Lasers cannons are used. Its colour changes to ice-blue which bears the image of what appears to be a mountain.

==Additional Information==
*The Five Magic Stones have the most [[hit box]]es in the ''[[Touhou Project]]'' that affect individual health bars in the same boss fight, followed by the [[Three Fairies of Light]] in ''[[Fairy Wars]]''.
*They are the only ''boss'' in the whole series to not have a name, not even an identity; characters such as the [[Minor Characters#Giant Toad|Giant Toad]] and the [[Giant Catfish]] have a form of identity in [[canon]], and therefore the latter is not included in this trivial fact. They are also the only nameless character in the series to have a theme song.
*Their theme name "Bet on Death" would suggest that you are risking death when you come near them.
*They're the first characters to use green coloured bullets.
*It's the only character in the whole series that shoots constant bullets at the player when the player comes near the boss. More specifically, it's the middle sphere that shoots bullets at Reimu when she's in the region of the grey platform.
*The books in [[Patchouli Knowledge]]'s [[spell card]], ''[[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil/Spell Cards/Extra#Spell Card 54|Five Elements Sign "Philosopher's Stone"]]'', are arranged in a similar way to the spheres.
*[[Reimu Hakurei]] seems to be scared before and after the boss battle with the Five Magic Stones, thus making this the only ever time that Reimu was scared and/or afraid of a boss before and after the battle.

{{nihongo|'''Flandre Scarlet'''|フランドール・スカーレット|Furandooru Sukaaretto}} is the younger sister of [[Remilia Scarlet]] and a [[vampire]] who lives at the [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]]. She first appeared as the Extra stage [[Boss|boss]] of [[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]], and has appeared as a playable protagonist in [[Touhou Gouyoku Ibun]].

==General Information==
Flandre first appeared as the Extra [[Stage]] [[boss]] of ''[[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]]'' with the famous theme ''[[U.N. Owen was Her?]]'', as well as a target in the Extra Stage of ''[[Shoot the Bullet]]''. She's been interviewed in ''[[Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red]]'' and has had an article in ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'' and ''[[The Grimoire of Marisa]]''. She also appeared in ''[[Foul Detective Satori]]''.

She also appeared as a playable protagonist in [[Touhou Gouyoku Ibun]]. This was the first time she had a major role in a [[Touhou Project]] game since her introduction in 2002 in ''Embodiment of Scarlet Devil''. It was also the first time she was playable in a ''Touhou'' game.

===Personality===
In ''Embodiment of Scarlet Devil'', she is described as being quite strange and eccentric, which makes it difficult for others to understand her.&lt;ref name="EoSDomake" /&gt; She's also described as being "normally docile" and generally pleasant to be around, but somewhat of a loose cannon if left unwatched. In ''[[Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red/Flandre|Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red]]'', it's suggested that she isn't very good at talking to other people, though she can get rather sassy and uppity when talking with her sister. Her friendship toward [[human]]s is very low.&lt;ref name="PMiSSFlandre" /&gt;

In ''[[Foul Detective Satori]]'', her attitude was particularly impolite and informal, speaking in a very casual tone and generally doing as she wished without consideration of consequences, although she stopped short of seriously injuring anyone.

In ''[[Touhou Gouyoku Ibun]]'', she appeared to only care about "destroying the indestructible" when facing off against [[Yuuma Toutetsu]], although she did display a willingness to work with [[Okina Matara]], insofar as it let her have some fun.

Until the time when she met either [[Marisa Kirisame]] or [[Reimu Hakurei]] in ''Embodiment of Scarlet Devil'', she claimed to not have seen any [[human]]s other than when they were prepared for a meal, although it's left vague as to whether that was her idea of a dark joke.

During the events of [[Touhou Gouyoku Ibun]], however, she left the grounds of the Mansion for an extended period of time of her own accord to fight [[Yuuma Toutetsu]], marking her first major departure from the grounds of the Mansion since her introduction.

===Abilities===
[[File:GoMIllus-Flandre.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Flandre, as illustrated in ''[[The Grimoire of Marisa]]''.]]
As a [[vampire]], Flandre possesses superhuman capabilities just like [[Remilia Scarlet]], such as enhanced physical strength, with the destructive power of [[oni]] and the nimbleness of [[tengu]], as well as a [[vampire]]'s bodily and regenerative ability. She can swing an oversized sword, though not as quickly as she would like to.&lt;ref name="GoMFlandre"&gt;[[Grimoire of Marisa]]: [[The Grimoire of Marisa/Flandre Scarlet's Spell Cards|Flandre Scarlet's spell cards]]&lt;/ref&gt; Since she doesn't know the proper way to attack humans, she is unable to go easy on them and blows them away without a trace.

;Destroying absolutely anything and everything
Flandre can destroy anything she wants, which is truly a frightening ability with no real weaknesses.&lt;ref name="PMiSSFlandre" /&gt; By moving the "eye" of the object, where the tension is highest, and by attacking this eye, she is able to destroy the target. She is able to move the "eye" of anything into the middle of her hand, then she pours her power into it or in other words, she crushes the "eye" and unconditionally destroys the target with just a squeeze.&lt;ref name="PMiSSFlandre" /&gt; She states that everything has an "eye" and that she has the "eyes" of everything in her right hand. She destroyed a meteor with a single hand and without touching it, where Flandre stated that she "went ''squeeze'' and it went ''boom''".&lt;ref name="BAiJRFlandre" /&gt;
When Sakuya was locked in the basement with Flandre, she destroyed the lock of a door simply by holding its handle, and without making any visible explosion.&lt;ref name="CDS 3.5"&gt;''[[Cheating Detective Satori]]'' - Chapter 3.5&lt;/ref&gt; Everything that is made for her to play with ends up broken, which may mean why she doesn't have many playmates, to which it's recommended to never meet with her.&lt;ref name="PMiSSFlandre" /&gt; 

;Cloning herself
Flandre is able to clone herself as seen in one of her [[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil/Spell Cards/Extra#Spell Card 57|spell card]]s where she creates 3 clones that helps her in the battle. The clones ''attack as they like'' which could mean they're able to think independently to some grade.&lt;ref name="GoMFlandre" /&gt; It's in the category "Slave Type" so they're under the command of the original Flandre.&lt;ref name="GoMFlandre" /&gt;

===Possessions===
In her hand, she possesses an object that looks like a crooked clock needle (sometimes thought to be a [[wikipedia:Lævateinn|Lævateinn]]) – this is a prominent peculiarity associated with Flandre, in which the name is derived from her second [[spell card]] ''[[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil/Spell Cards/Extra#Spell Card 56|Taboo "Lævateinn"]]''. It shares its name with the sword (wand in some versions) of [[Wikipedia:Loki|Loki]], a Norse god known for causing mischief. This sword/wand is used by the fire giant [[wikipedia:Surtr|Surt]] in [[wikipedia:Ragnarök|Ragnarok]] (the Norse equivalent of the Apocalypse) to burn down the whole world, except for one safe heaven. Fitting that Flandre would be wielding a tool of such destructive might.

She also possesses unusually peculiar wings, an irregular shape unlike those of any living creature, [[youkai]] or [[ghost]],&lt;ref name="PMiSSFlandre" /&gt; or even to a [[vampire]]'s typical bat-like wings (or even organic matter). Reimu even said, "I doubt she can fly with those wings". Concerning this statement, [[Hieda no Akyuu]] noted that there are plenty of those in [[Gensokyo]] who can fly without wings.&lt;ref name="PMiSSFlandre" /&gt;

==Backstory==
Flandre has lived for at least 495 years, but she has allegedly never left the grounds of the [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]], and rarely leaves even the building itself, if ever.&lt;ref name="PMiSSFlandre"&gt;[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]: [[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Flandre Scarlet|Flandre Scarlet]]&lt;/ref&gt; As she herself never tried going outside, she was apparently raised knowing nothing about the outside world.&lt;ref name="EoSDomake"&gt;[[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]]: omake.txt&lt;/ref&gt; However, she's shown a slight interest to go outside after the events of ''[[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]]''. Her initial attempt to do so was blocked by [[Patchouli Knowledge]]'s rain summoning magic in the Extra Stage, but since then she has been seen outside the mansion itself when she was destroying a falling meteor.&lt;ref name="BAiJRFlandre"&gt;[[Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red]]: [[Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red/Flandre|Flandre's article.]]&lt;/ref&gt;
==Character Design==
[[File:PMiSS flandre.jpg|thumb|250px|Flandre's depiction in ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]''.]]

===Name===
Her full name is {{nihongo|''Flandre Scarlet''|フランドール・スカーレット}} &lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20040404190222/www16.big.or.jp/~zun/cgi-bin/diary/nicky.cgi?page=1 Winter Comic Thanks N° 2 (ZUN's Diary's post on 4th January 2004)]&lt;/ref&gt;. The name Flandre is a modern French term for [[wikipedia:Flanders|Flanders]], a region which makes out the northern part of Belgium. Note that the pronunciation of her name in Japanese goes more along the lines of "Flandoor" or "Flandoll" rather than "Flander/Flandre" since her name in katakana was not {{lang|ja|フランドル}}, which would have been the more relevant katakana for "Flandre". Generally, there isn't actually any right or wrong way to pronounce the names in non-Japanese languages.

"Scarlet" refers to a bright shade of the color red with a slight hint of orange and is a variant of "Scarlett" as a surname. The middle dot ({{lang|ja|・}}) in the middle of her name is used in foreign names to show where the next word begins. In ''[[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]]'', she was called {{nihongo||妹様|Imouto-sama|lit. "''your [her] honor, little sister [of the mistress]''"}} by [[Patchouli Knowledge]].

===Design===
In ''[[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]]'''s official art, Flandre has red eyes and short blond hair, which is tied into a single ponytail on her left side. Wears a red dress and vest, with a pink shirt underneath and socks. Also wears a pink mob cap with a red ribbon attached. She carries a matching wand with her, which might be the mythical [[wikipedia:Lævateinn|Lævateinn]]. Arranged from her back to the tip of her wings her 8 crystals which are presented in seven colours&lt;ref name="PMiSSFlandre" /&gt;: &lt;span style="background:black"&gt;'''{{color|#82FDE7|light blue}}, {{color|#85A4FD|blue}}, {{color|#CB88FE|purple}}, {{color|#fc7fc8|pink}}, {{color|#FCBA80|orange}}, {{color|#FFFC9A|yellow}}, {{color|#A4FC82|light green}}'''&lt;/span&gt; and finally &lt;span style="background:black"&gt;'''{{color|#82FDE7|light blue}}'''&lt;/span&gt; again. In ''[[Gouyoku Ibun]]'', the arrangement shifts by one color, presenting her wings in the following order: &lt;span style="background:black"&gt;'''{{color|#6c99ec|blue}}, {{color|#b69dfa|purple}}, {{color|#ef74a0|pink}}, {{color|#eb94b0|light pink}}, {{color|#faca65|yellow}}, {{color|#68c862|green}}, {{color|#55caef|light blue}}'''&lt;/span&gt; and once again &lt;span style="background:black"&gt;'''{{color|#6c99ec|blue}}'''&lt;/span&gt;, and there is more variation of hue within the crystals.

==Appearances==
[[File:FSch7-SDMChars.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Flandre shown with [[Remilia Scarlet]] in ''[[Forbidden Scrollery]]'' Chapter 7]]

In [[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]], Flandre states she hasn't left the [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]] for about 495 years, and has been staying in the basement of the mansion since then. [[Hieda no Akyuu]] theorizes on this in [[Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red]], stating that Flandre is probably a shut-in.

It seems her confinement in the Scarlet Devil Mansion has given her time to understand every part of it, as she has been seen wandering inside the Mansion by some humans&lt;ref&gt;"Sometimes when I sneak into the Scarlet Devil Mansion like I own it, I run into the little sister. I had to slip by without drawin' her attention, but after goin' through all that to get into the place, I was hopin' I wouldn't run into her." (Marisa Kirisame)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"I saw her shadow wandering around the mansion while I was at an outdoor party at the Scarlet Devil Mansion. It was truly frightening. I knew it was her just from the silhouette, but she doesn't get to join many parties." (Anonymous)&lt;/ref&gt; and even hold an interview with [[Aya Shameimaru]] in the garden&lt;ref&gt;[[Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red/Flandre|Flandre's Interview]]&lt;/ref&gt;. In [[Forbidden Scrollery]], Flandre appears watching [[Tupai|the pet of her sister]] along with her.
===Games===

;''Embodiment of Scarlet Devil''
[[File:Th06FlandreSprite.png|frame|Flandre's sprite in ''EoSD'']]
[[File:Th06RemiliaBatSprite.png|frame|Flandre's bat form sprite in ''EoSD'']]

After the main events of the game, Flandre makes her way out of the [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]]'s basement while Remilia is off at the [[Hakurei Shrine]]. With no other choice, [[Patchouli]] uses her magic to cause a rainstorm around the mansion so that she wouldn't be able to leave it. Soon enough, the player character makes their way to her.
:{{Main|Embodiment of Scarlet Devil/Story/Reimu's Extra|l1=Reimu Extra Arc}}
When Reimu finds Flandre, she demands an explanation as to why her sister has been bothering her at the shrine. They decide to have a danmaku battle, and Reimu eventually emerges victorious. Flandre appears to calm down afterwards.
:{{Main|Embodiment of Scarlet Devil/Story/Marisa's Extra|l1=Marisa Extra Arc}}
Marisa introduces herself as Reimu, but Flandre sees through the play - apparently she's aware of the magician's identity. After Marisa defeats her, they trade quotes from a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/And_Then_There_Were_None certain book], adapted to fit their current situation.

;''Shoot the Bullet''

[[File:Th095FlandreBatSprite.png|frame|Flandre's bat form sprite in ''StB'']]
In ''[[Shoot the Bullet]]'', [[Aya Shameimaru]] encountered Flandre on the Extra [[stage]] and took photos of her [[danmaku]].

;''Touhou Gouyoku Ibun''
After Reimu, Marisa, [[Kanako Yasaka]], [[Minamitsu Murasa]], [[Joon Yorigami]] and [[Shion Yorigami]] are all unable to defeat [[Yuuma Toutetsu]] due to her ability to absorb any attack, [[Okina Matara]] approaches Flandre and briefs her on the situation, seeing her power to destroy anything as the way to deal with Toutetsu. Enticed by an opportunity to get out of the Scarlet Devil Mansion and let her powers loose on a foe no one else is able to defeat, Flandre agrees. However, being a vampire, she is weak against water, and so Okina prepares several opponents for her to train against and get used to fighting around water, using their backdoors to teleport right to them.

After three of these fights, Okina takes Flandre to the Sea of Petroleum in [[Former Hell]] to fight Toutetsu. Before they are able to find her, Flandre encounters Reimu, who is embarrassed by her failure to defeat Toutetsu and wondering if it would be fine to just let her be. Disgusted by Reimu's cowardice, Flandre fights her to try to reawaken her resolve. Flandre wins, but she is pleased with Reimu's ferocity during the fight, and leaves satisfied.

Flandre then encounters Toutetsu, who tries to convince her that she is not a threat, but Flandre tells her that she is no hero of justice, and she is just here to unleash her full strength and triumph over an opponent that no one else was able to overcome. She defeats Toutetsu once, but Okina appears and tells Flandre she won't be able to destroy Toutetsu by fighting that way, and so she reveals the true form of the Sea of Petroleum as the Abandoned Hell of Blood Pools and uses its power to strengthen Toutetsu. Flandre defeats her again, and forces Toutetsu to begin inhaling large quantities of blood to recover. Flandre absorbs blood to create bullets capable of destroying anything, shaped like apples, and throws them down Toutetsu's throat, defeating her.

After this, Toutetsu makes a deal with Okina and the surface-dwellers to share the petroleum rather than hog it all for herself. Flandre wonders if Toutetsu's survival means she failed, but Okina reassures her that she succeeded: the Toutetsu that had absorbed the greed of the Abandoned Hell of Blood Pools was destroyed, and the current Toutetsu has only absorbed the greed of the surface dwellers.

===Literature===

;''[[Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red]]''
[[File:052BAiJRFlandre.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Flandre destroying a meteor in her article in ''[[Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red]]''.]]
:{{Main|Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red/Flandre}}
In April 2006, [[Aya Shameimaru]] reports on the strange explosion of a meteorite above [[Gensokyo]]. She learns that Flandre was the one who destroyed it, but becomes increasingly confused as Flandre explains she destroyed it by squeezing the eye of the meteorite in her hand. Even more perplexing information is given by Flandre's older sister, [[Remilia Scarlet]]. Apparently, it was planned that the meteorite was supposed to be aimed at the [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]] and that Flandre would destroy it. Inexplicably, Aya ends the article with a report that spring has begun.

In her follow-up, Aya interviews Flandre about the explosion and Remilia's information. Flandre gives the same explanation for how she destroyed the meteorite, and, when questioned, says that her sister just acts like she knows what's happening. Remilia interrupts (for which Aya is thankful), and confirms that what Flandre said was true, insinuating that Aya just can't understand, while giving strange information about the meteorite's source.
;''[[Foul Detective Satori]]''
[[Sakuya Izayoi]] was locked in to the basement with [[Flandre Scarlet]] by the other mansion residents. However, Flandre let her out of the basement shortly after by destroying the lock on the basement door, revealing that she stays in the basement because she finds it comfortable down there, and that she couldn't actually be locked in even if they tried to.

Later on, sensing "powerful malice" inside of [[Hong Meiling]] she attempted to "exterminate" her, the other residents however quickly revealed that this was due to [[Mizuchi Miyadeguchi]] having possessed her recently.

==Music Theme==
Her boss theme ("[[U.N. Owen was her?]]") and her second-to-last spell card ([[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil/Spell Cards/Extra#Spell Card 63|Secret Barrage "And Then Will There Be None?"]]) are references to [[wikipedia:Agatha Christie|Agatha Christie]]'s novel ''[[wikipedia:And Then There Were None|And Then There Were None]]''. The plot of the book follows eight people who were invited to a small, isolated island by Ulick Norman Owen and Una Nancy Owen. Shortly after their arrival, a gramophone record is played, accusing each visitor of committing murder and escaping justice. The characters discover that none of them actually knows the Owens, and they conclude that their initials - "U.N. Owen" - are a shorthand for "Unknown". As the novel continues, every character meets their end, with each cause of death reflecting a part of a nursery rhyme. [[ZUN]] referred to this in the title of Flandre's song because she's, essentially, an ''unknown'' being.&lt;ref name="EoSDomake"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationships==
Currently there have not been many portrayals of her relations other than to her older sister, but since it has been stated that "she has few friends even among the youkai of the Scarlet Devil Mansion, and spends most of her time in isolation",&lt;ref name="PMiSSFlandre" /&gt; she probably does not have very favourable relations with other residents.

===Residents of the Scarlet Devil Mansion===
[[File:053BAiJRFlandre.jpg|thumb|200px|Remilia and Flandre, as illustrated in ''[[Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red]]''.]]
[[Remilia Scarlet]] is Flandre's older sister. Flandre is stated to respect her sister and Remilia cares for Flandre as shown where she is considering getting her a good tutor in ''[[Imperishable Night]]'', but it is unknown how often the two interact. ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'' states that it's rare (but not nonexistent) to see Flandre and Remilia together. However, they are seen depicted together many times such as in ''[[Forbidden Scrollery]]'' chapter 7 when they were looking at their pet [[Minor Characters#Tupai|Tupai]] and in ''[[Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red]]'', which also shows that Remilia will at least allow [[Aya Shameimaru]] to interview Flandre in the first place. They also show up together in ''[[The Grimoire of Usami]]'', ''[[Violet Detector]]'', and ''[[Foul Detective Satori]]''.

The interview shows that although Flandre might respect her older sister, it's to the extent you'd expect a snarky child to. She is willing to outright state when she thinks Remilia is just spouting nonsense, at which point Remilia comes in with a comment that she shouldn't be talking about her older sister like that. Her treatment of her older sister became harsh and she even called Remilia {{nihongo|"that person"|あいつ|aitsu}}

Not much is known about Flandre's relationships with other residents as she spends most of her time in the basement. Patchouli is aware of Flandre's existence and the need to keep her confined to the mansion, as Remilia noted Patchouli was probably causing a rainstorm around the mansion to keep Flandre from getting out. Sakuya also serves Flandre, as Flandre is the sister of Remilia, who is the head of the house. Someone prepares Flandre's food, which are humans prepared in the shape of pastries and other pleasant things, and although not directly stated, it has to be Sakuya.

It's unknown what kind of relationship Flandre has with [[Hong Meiling]], the [[Fairy Maid]]s, the recent [[hobgoblin]]s and [[Koakuma]].

===Minor Relationships===
;[[Reimu Hakurei]]
Though the shrine maiden promises to come play with her every so often during their dialogue in ''[[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]]'', the two have not been seen together since then, so it is likely she just said that to get her to calm down.

;[[Marisa Kirisame]]
Her conversation with Marisa in ''Embodiment of Scarlet Devil'' leaves an impression that the two are quite friendly. However, Marisa commented, "Sometimes when I sneak into the Scarlet Devil Mansion, I run into the little sister. I had to slip by without drawin' her attention, but after goin' through all that to get into the place, I was hopin' I wouldn't run into her."&lt;ref name="PMiSSFlandre" /&gt;

;[[Okina Matara]]
During the events of [[Touhou Gouyoku Ibun]], Okina Matara convinced Flandre Scarlet into becoming an [[Assassin|assassin]] to take out [[Yuuma Toutetsu]] and thwart her plans.

==Additional Information==
*A silhouette of Flandre occupies the front of ''[[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]]'''s jewel case.
*Flandre is one of the few characters to not appear in the background during ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'', which would relate to her lack of leaving the [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]].
*Based on her being around 495 years old during the events of EoSD, Flandre was probably born sometime in the late 15th century.
*The spell card reference ("And Then Will There Be None?") to an Agatha Christie novel is definite. It's more speculative but still worth noting that the science-fiction genre saw Philip K. Dick write a novel called "Counter-Clock World" in 1967 and Frederik Pohl write "The Gold at the Starbow's End" in 1972.
*On one end of the Lævateinn that Flandre is seen holding in ''[[Shoot the Bullet]]'' is very different compared to the Lævateinn that Flandre is seen holding in ''Embodiment of Scarlet Devil''.
*She used the phrase "that means, you can't use a continue!" to [[Marisa Kirisame]], which was breaking the [[Canon#Fourth Wall|fourth wall]].
*In the Second Touhou Saimoe Tournament, the 8th game of the first round was a battle between Flandre and [[Suika Ibuki]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://tuguna.info/toho/saimoe2.htm Watch report] of the Second Touhou Saimoe Tournament.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the battle ended with Flan winning, this led to [[ZUN]] posting a rough drawing of Suika that hadn't been open to the public with a message saying "don't get defeated by a little sister that hasn't even reached the age of 500!"&lt;ref name="ThShofu14"&gt;[[ZUN's former blog "Touhou Shofu" 14]]&lt;/ref&gt;.
*The "crystals" on her wings look somewhat similar to the crystals shown on [[Patchouli Knowledge]]'s spell card, ''[[Immaterial and Missing Power/Spell Cards/Patchouli Knowledge#Spell Card 6|Fire Water Wood Metal Earth Sign "Philosopher's Stone"]]''.
*Strangely, if one uses a bomb against her in ''Embodiment of Scarlet Devil'''s Extra, she's shown to have normal wings in bat form.
*It's hard to notice, but Flandre's skirt has two white ribbons on her EoSD portrait&lt;ref&gt;https://nrr08.com/f_scarlet.html&lt;/ref&gt;.
*Shibata Masahiro's manga series "[https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/manga.php?id=1648 Sarai]" seems to be a big inspiration for many of the characters from EoSD . Sarai is a manga about superpowered maids fighting youkai and monsters in a dystopian future. The series was published from 1997 to 2007 in Japan only.
** In Sarai there are [https://onsen.touhouwiki.net/wiki/File:Two_maids_with_mob_cap.jpeg two small maid girls with red hair and wear mob caps]. This is likely what inspired [[Remilia]] and Flandre.

フランドール・スカーレット

能力：ありとあらゆるものを破壊する程度の能力


エキストラボスです。お嬢様の妹です。

吸血鬼にして魔法少女で、４９５年程、悪魔の妹をしています。少々気がふれていて、通常は表に出してももらえません。出ようともしません。

レミリアをお姉様と慕うも、その歯止めの効かない破壊力は、遥かにお姉様を凌ぎます。普段はあまり怒ったりしないのですが、常におかしいので他人には良く分かりません。

通常、吸血鬼は食事をするために、人間を殺さない程度にしか襲いませんが、フランドールは与えられたものしか食べたことが無いため、人間の襲い方を知りません。そのため手加減が出来なく、一滴の血の残さず吹き飛ばしてしまいます。

もしかしたら、いつも自分が食べているものが動いている人間と一致しないのかも知れません。&lt;br /&gt;
毎日食べているものが、見た目ケーキになってたり、紅茶になっていたりしたのですから...

カードアタック　全10種
| translation = '''Sister of the Devil'''&lt;br /&gt;
'''Flandre Scarlet'''

Ability: Destroying absolutely anything


The Extra Boss. Also the Mistress's younger sister.

She is a vampiric magical girl and has been the Scarlet Devil's younger sister for about 495 years. She cannot control herself, so generally she isn't let outside. She also doesn't try going out.

She idolizes her older sister [[Remilia Scarlet|Remilia]], but her destructive power unconstrained far exceeds that of her sister's. Although she doesn't often get angry or anything, she's always peculiar, which makes it difficult for others to understand her.

Generally, [[vampire]]s always attack [[human]]s without killing them in order to feed, but Flandre has only ever eaten food that has been served to her, so she doesn't know how to properly attack a human. Because of this, she can't limit herself and ends up blowing them away without leaving a drop of blood.

Speaking of which, she doesn't even know that what she always eats were once living humans. Her daily meals are made to look like foodstuffs such as cake and tea, after all...

Total of ten card attacks.

I gave Remilia bat wings to make her look like a vampire, then by contradicting the bat wings logic I gave her sister wings with unknown shapes that don't make her look like a vampire. I felt Touhou from this contrarian design, and I felt even more when I brought Nue-like youkai back to Gensokyo. That made me realize how Flandre's design was connected to Touhou's grand scheme later on.

{{nihongo|'''Fujiwara no Mokou'''|藤原 妹紅}} was formerly an ordinary [[human]], but she became an [[immortal]] being after drinking the [[Hourai Elixir]] about 1300 years ago. Now she is never able to die, though she still feels the pain of injuries as normal. She's considered to be very powerful, given her long life, the power she earned through her life, and her immortal status since she can keep fighting until she can no longer stand the pain.

==General Information==
Mokou first appeared as the Extra [[stage]] [[boss]] of ''[[Imperishable Night]]'' and ''[[Shoot the Bullet]]''. She also appeared as a background cameo in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'' and as a day 3 boss in ''[[Impossible Spell Card]]'', and later became a playable character in ''[[Urban Legend in Limbo]]''.

===Personality===
Perhaps due to being ostracized for so long, Mokou is a loner by nature and chooses not to socialize with humans or youkai. She escorts lost humans she finds within the [[Bamboo Forest of the Lost]], giving herself a job similar to that of a bamboo forest guide, and even then after escorting between [[Human Village]] and [[Eientei]], she departs without saying a word. Nevertheless, to those whom she's acquainted with, she speaks bluntly and with lively personality. In ''Imperishable Night'''s extra stage, for example, she was easily roused and goes on a rant about how annoying Kaguya is. Not much else is known about her as she doesn't really talk much to anyone.

Her style can be described as masculine - she wears a dress shirt with suspenders and [https://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/軽衫 karusan] (a type of [[wikipedia:hakama|hakama]] typically worn by men) tied at the waist, rather than above the waist as is standard for women's hakama. Although she used feminine speech patterns in [[Imperishable Night]], beginning in [[Urban Legend in Limbo]], her speech is typically masculine as well.

She undertakes the duty of escorting people in the [[Bamboo Forest of the Lost]]. Although this may allow her a wider opportunity to socialize with other people, she still remains very reticent about herself. For example, when asked about her past, she doesn't answer with anything other than "I'm an ordinary health maniac who runs a [[Wikipedia:Yakitori|yakitori]] stand" (it is unclear whether she truly does run a yakitori stand). However, she seems to happily listen to others' talking. Thus, even if someone doesn't lose one's way, it would be possible for her to be enlivened by a conversation.

She presently seems to be very content with her life contrary to being commonly thought of having a pessimistic lifestyle. With an unaging, undying body, she and [[Kaguya Houraisan]] kill each other every day, and the text of ''[[Imperishable Night]]'' even emphasizes this with the line "and she is alive to enjoy it, how magnificent!

===Abilities===
;Neither aging nor dying
[[File:GoMIllus-Mokou.jpg|thumb|200px|Illustration of Mokou  in ''[[Grimoire of Marisa]]'']]
Mokou's inability to die allows her body to receive an indefinite amount of punishment. No matter whether she's beheaded, incinerated or has taken any other form of strike, she'll always revive without exception. Mokou will recover within a few day's time if she takes a non-fatal blow. Due to the nature of the [[Hourai Elixir]] she drank over 1300 years ago, she's also incapable of contracting any form of disease or illness. This includes the natural process of aging.&lt;ref name="INMTEx"&gt;[[Imperishable Night]]: [[Imperishable Night/Translation/Magic Team's Extra|Magic Team's Extra]]&lt;/ref&gt; It is said she can completely recover even if a single hair remained&lt;ref name="PMiSSMokou"&gt;[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]: [[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Fujiwara no Mokou|Mokou]]&lt;/ref&gt;, although it seems redundant because those who taste the elixir will recover regardless.

Mokou's immortality, however, doesn't prevent her from being susceptible to fatigue. Even though she is incapable of dying, she still feels pain when injured just as a normal [[human]] does. It's said that since she doesn't die, feeling the sting of death when she reaches the brink of oblivion brings her a great deal of pain and fatigue when she immediately revives. For this reason, she can be defeated in [[spell card]] matches with [[danmaku]] even though she's invincible. It should be noted though, that this fatigue may be completely mental since she needs no sustenance such as food or sleep to stay alive.

;Manipulation of fire
Though never clearly described, Mokou appears to have some sort of control over fire. Many of her spell cards symbolize phoenix imagery, though this is most likely an aesthetic choice by Mokou (due to the phoenix being symbolic of immortality) rather than having any real meaning. The fact it took the combined efforts of her, Kaguya, and several rabbits to put out a forest fire in her ''[[Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red]]'' article implies that while she's capable of starting and increasing fire, she might not necessarily be able to ''extinguish'' it.

;All sorts of sorcery
According to ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'', in her long life it seems she's mastered various kinds of sorcery to the point in which she can handle [[youkai]] lightly. She uses all kinds of [[spell card]]s in addition to her ability of manipulation of flames, which may also be a kind of sorcery she has mastered. However, it's never been stated exactly what kinds of sorcery she has mastered.

===Occupation===
Mokou frequently escorts anyone wanting to go to [[Eientei]] through the [[Bamboo Forest of the Lost]]. She also claims to run a [[Wikipedia:Yakitori|yakitori]] stand. In addition, she regularly fights with Kaguya, and has for many years. As a powerful human (or a being who was once human), one of her main jobs is also youkai extermination.

Upon receiving escort from her, it is impossible to get lost in the bamboo forest. Also, there's no life-threatening danger in the forest since [[youkai]] would not attack. Because of that, it's a myth in the Human Village that if it's necessary to go to Eientei, that Mokou should immediately be contacted.

==Backstory==
[[File:CiLR_Mokou.png|thumb|250px|A past &amp; present comparison of Mokou in ''CiLR'']]
Mokou was born as a daughter to the Fujiwara family during the Asuka and Nara periods. It's been estimated that it was around 700CE (i.e., currently about 1300 years old). It seems that she was an unwanted child because she wasn't allowed to go out in public.

Around 1300 years ago, [[Kaguya Houraisan]] embarrassed Mokou's father&amp;nbsp;– and entire family&amp;nbsp;– by presenting him with an impossible request when he asked for her hand in marriage (as had happened with many other young men). Mokou grew to resent the moon princess, and searched for a way to spite her, but Kaguya disappeared, apparently returning to the [[moon]] before Mokou could take revenge.

She finally found a way, by making an attempt to steal the [[Hourai Elixir]] for herself that Kaguya left for the [[Wikipedia:Emperor of Japan|Emperor of Japan]] of that time because it was something very important to Kaguya. She followed a group of soldiers led by a man named [[Iwakasa]] in secret, who were going up what is now [[Wikipedia:Mount Fuji|Mount Fuji]]. However, it was difficult for the young girl to climb the mountain alone without proper equipment, so she quickly ran out of energy. This was then Iwakasa realized that she was present, so he helped her and they continued on, reaching the summit as one group. Once there, Mokou discovered that the group of soldiers planned to fling the jar into the fires of the volcano to destroy it, on orders from the current Emperor of Japan. As they were about to throw it in, the goddess [[Konohana-Sakuyahime]], who calms the eruptions of Mount Fuji, appeared and forbid the group to throw the jar into the volcano because Mount Fuji's volcanic activities would restart should they do so. She explained to them that it was in fact the [[Hourai Elixir]], the elixir of immortality. She gave the command to go to Yatsugatake where her older sister [[Iwanagahime]] handles immortality and unchangingness dwelt.

The soldiers tried to light the jar on fire, but Sakuyahime's powers prevented it. What happened after is unclear; Mokou believes that Iwakasa's men were killed by Konohana during their night watch because they tried to take the elixir for themselves as Iwakasa and Mokou slept. As the two got further down, Mokou was finally possessed by the desire for immortality, so she murdered Iwakasa and stole it from him, consuming it and thus became immortal.

After achieving immortality, she had an undying body, but [[human]]s who don't grow older aren't able to live as an ordinary humans, so until she drifted to [[Gensokyo]], she moved from place to place, never stopping to dwell in one location. She spent three hundred years in isolation, away from the hateful eyes of people. For three hundred years after that, she would destroy anything that crossed her path, but after that, she spent three hundred years in boredom as the [[youkai]] couldn't hold her interest any longer. It's assumed that during these six hundred years she appeared in [[Gensokyo]]. It's unknown exactly when Mokou came to [[Gensokyo]], but after nine hundred years total, she found out that Kaguya did not actually return to the moon but continued a life of escape, and that Kaguya also became one with an undying body.

Mokou was ecstatic in discovering someone who was in the same mess she was in. Since then Mokou and Kaguya have mutually killed each other day in, day out for about [[Cage in Lunatic Runagate/Fourth Chapter|300 years]]. After the incident of ''[[Imperishable Night]]'', perhaps due to the influence of [[Eientei]] accepting patients who come for medical examinations, she also started creating her own connection with the humans of the [[Human Village]] by taking the position of an escort and guiding people through the bamboo forest who want to go to Eientei. She remains very reticent, however.

On [[Maribel Hearn]]'s trip to the [[Bamboo Forest of the Lost]] of several hundred years ago she met a girl who seems to be Mokou.&lt;ref&gt;[[Changeability of Strange Dream]]'s 9th section&lt;/ref&gt; She rescued her from a [[mouse]] or [[rabbit]] [[youkai]], which then ran away and hid after "a girl entirely on fire" chased the youkai away without a word exchanged between the two. In ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'', [[Hieda no Akyuu]] speculates that Mokou is a descendant of a hidden group of "youkai-killing ninja". People in general are doubtful of the clan's existence. Akyuu claims that Mokou feigns ignorance when asked about it.

==Character Design==
[[File:PMiSS mokou.jpg|thumb|220px|Mokou's depiction in ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'']]
===Origin===
Considering Mokou's surname and her back story as a daughter of an aristocrat charmed by the Kaguya-hime of legend, Mokou's father is strongly implied to be {{nihongo|Kuramochi no Miko|車持皇子}}, who was given the quest for the Jeweled Branch of Hourai by Kaguya. However, many people also say that her father was {{nihongo|[[wikipedia:Fujiwara no Fuhito|Fujiwara no Fuhito]]|藤原不比等}}, the most plausible candidate based on his surname and the factual founder of the powerful [[Wikipedia:Fujiwara clan|Fujiwara clan]] that existed between the 9th century and 13th century, but this person is only a candidate for whom Kuramochi no Miko could have been modeled after, and it must be warned that it's not a clear matter of the original ''[[Wikipedia:The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter|The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter]]''. Incidentally, Fujiwara no Fuhito had nine children, four sons and five daughters, and among the five daughters, it is unclear who the mother of the fourth and fifth daughters are, and for the fifth daughter, her name is even unknown.

If Kuramochi no Miko were Mokou's father, "Miko" ("prince") would mean a blood relationship with the [[Wikipedia:Emperor of Japan|Emperor of Japan]], but as this has been used to refer to the sons of the emperor, it has been said that she's an offspring of a direct descendant of the emperor of that time (As a certain historical fact, all of the Miko ("princes") other than Kuramochi no Miko were enthroned as emperors, and thus Mokou's family would have a collateral relation, but in the time of the marriage proposal to Kaguya, Mokou's grandfather would be the emperor, implying that she would have had a direct relation at that time).

===Name===
Her full name is {{nihongo|''Fujiwara no Mokou''|藤原　妹紅}}. Her last name {{nihongo||藤原|Fujiwara|lit. "Wisteria field"}} is an actual and a common surname used in Japan - it should be noted that while this is one of the evidence which proves the political influence of the Fujiwara Clan, there are some Fujiwaras that aren't related to the Fujiwara Clan.

The characters for {{nihongo||妹紅|Mokou}} literally mean "Scarlet (younger) Sister". According to [[ZUN]], however, ''Mokou'' can also mean "Paint me red" and her name has no connection to [[Flandre Scarlet]]. In the right context, ''Kou'' can also be translated as "female phoenix bird", which is fitting, while ''Mo'' can be translated as "mourning". Her name would mean something similar to "Mourning female Phoenix bird", a name somewhat fitting for her exiled life and events of her past. One of the kanjis is also shared in the Japanese name for the {{nihongo|[[Wikipedia:Sanguisorba officinalis|great burnet]]|吾亦'''紅'''|Waremokou}}, a [[plant]] that's known to cool the blood, stop bleeding, clear heat, and heal wounds. Specifically, the root is used to stop bloody dysentery, nosebleeds, and is applied topically to treat burns and insect bites.

Another noteworthy fact is that Mokou's last name is not actually a {{nihongo|"family name"|苗字|myouji}}, but a {{nihongo|"clan's name"|氏/本姓|uji/honsei}} given by the Emperor. In ancient Japan times, it was common for aristocrats with ''uji'' to have the [[wikipedia:Hiragana|hiragana]] character {{lang|ja|の}} (''no'') between their ''uji'' and first name. The ''no'' used here indicates the "belonging", thus the English equivalent of her name would be "Mokou of the Fujiwara (Clan)".

;Mokou's Title
Mokou's character title {{nihongo||'''蓬莱'''の'''人'''の'''形'''|hourai no hito no katachi|"Figure of the Person of Hourai"}} is a Japanese style transcription of {{nihongo||蓬莱人形|hourai ningyou|"Hourai Doll"}}, a name of a spell card she uses. The word "hourai" used here is probably a reference to [[wikipedia:Mount Penglai|Mount Penglai]] (''Penglai'' is the Chinese reading of ''Hourai''): A legendary land in the Chinese mythology where hermits said to have lived.

The name Hourai Doll is also used in the Japanese main title of [[ZUN]]'s music CD ''[[Dolls in Pseudo Paradise]]'' and [[Alice Margatroid|Alice]]'s spell card {{nihongo|"Curse 'Hourai Doll'"|咒詛「蓬莱人形」}}. Considering ZUN's comment in [[Imperishable Night/Spell Cards/Extra#Spell Card 204|her card]], the connection between these and the story of ''[[Dolls in Pseudo Paradise]]'' is likely to be intentional. But the connection between these and Alice's card is probably irrelevant (at least directly), because Alice's Hourai Doll is probably only to be connected with the ''Dolls in Pseudo Paradise'' itself.

[[Imperishable Night/Spell Cards/Extra#Spell Card 199|Spell card #199]] in ''Imperishable Night'' is "Forgiveness: Honest Man's Death", which could also be a reference to the story in ''Dolls in Pseudo Paradise'' (where several honest men die).

===Design===
Mokou has red eyes and ankle-length white hair. She wears a light brown shirt that appears as if it's been discolored from fire, and dark red [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakama#Sashinuki_hakama sashinuki hakama] that are randomly decorated with [[Ofuda|paper charms]]. Her hair's tied with these same red and white paper charms. The paper talismans on Mokou's hakama and hair ribbons might be wards to protect her from being burned by fire. Her shirt, which lacks such talismans, appears to have been burnt repeatedly, while the ribbons and hakama show no such wear.

As depicted in the [[Cage in Lunatic Runagate/Fourth Chapter|fourth chapter]] of ''Cage in Lunatic Runagate'', Mokou is shown as having had short, dark hair before she drank the Hourai Elixir, though whether her current hair color was somehow caused by the Elixir is unknown. Mokou's hair had a blueish tint in ''[[Imperishable Night]]'' and continues in other spin-offs like ''[[Shoot the Bullet]]'', ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'' and ''[[Impossible Spell Card]]'', but changed to a reddish tint in ''[[Urban Legend in Limbo]]'' and ''[[Antinomy of Common Flowers]]'' .

Mokou is one of the few people in all of [[Gensokyo]] to wear relatively masculine clothing. This, along with her somewhat forceful way of speaking, often leads to her being depicted as something of a tomboy (perhaps why her parents kept her out of public view). However, because conditions in Gensokyo still resemble those of feudal Japan, patterned hakama are hard to come by and must be made by a skilled tailor and presumably are much more expensive than skirts or plain hakama. This makes patterned hakama a status symbol, and given Mokou's status as a daughter of the old Japanese aristocracy, she may have also affixed the charms to her hakama to distinguish her heritage.

==Appearances==
===Games===
;''Imperishable Night''
[[File:Th08MokouSprite.png|frame|Mokou's sprite in ''IN'']]
The heroines are all sent into the [[Bamboo Forest of the Lost]] for a "test of guts" by [[Kaguya Houraisan]], but Mokou knows that she did it to get at her. Once she realizes this, her anger is bridled, and they engage in combat.

===Spin-offs===
;''Shoot the Bullet''
In ''[[Shoot the Bullet]]'', [[Aya Shameimaru]] encountered Mokou on the Extra [[stage]] and took photos of her [[danmaku]].

;''Hopeless Masquerade''
[[File:Th135Mokou.png|frame|Mokou in ''HM'']]
Mokou made a background cameo appearance in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'' on the [[Human Village]] stage. She is seen sitting next to [[Keine Kamishirasawa]] with her legs crossed, yawning.

;''Impossible Spell Card''
:{{Main|Impossible Spell Card#Story|l1=Impossible Spell Card: Story}}
Presumably from hearing or seeing a wanted sign about the mischief-making [[amanojaku]] [[Seija Kijin]], Mokou appears to be one of the many [[human]]s and [[youkai]] that tries to capture her. She uses [[spell card]]s that are considered impossible to dodge.

;''Urban Legend in Limbo''
:{{Main|Urban_Legend_in_Limbo/Story/Mokou's_Scenario|l1=Urban Legend in Limbo: Mokou's Scenario}}
Mokou is a playable character in ''[[Urban Legend in Limbo]]''. After discovering that Reimu possesses the [[Occult Ball]] of Yomotsu Hirasaka, she sets out to collect them all.

;''Antinomy of Common Flowers''
In ''[[Antinomy of Common Flowers]]'', Mokou tags along with [[Mamizou Futatsuiwa]] in hopes of having fun with Perfect Posession. The team encounters the culprits of the incident, [[Joon Yorigami|Joon]] and [[Shion Yorigami]]. Joon steals Mokou away with her spell and forces her to fight Mamizou.

Mokou is one of few who prefers to fight as the slave in Perfect Posession instead of the master.

;''Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red''
:{{Main|Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red/Mokou|l1=Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red Article and Interview: Mokou}}
When [[Aya Shameimaru]] happened to notice a mysterious fire in the [[Bamboo Forest of the Lost]] near [[Eientei]] she decided to investigate. Two girls, Fujiwara no Mokou and [[Kaguya Houraisan]], were already present fighting the fire to put it out. Shortly after Aya began asking what had started the fire, Mokou suggested it might have been a cigarette butt from kids while Kaguya suggested it was [[Wikipedia:Yakitori|yakitori]]. In her interview, Mokou used Kaguya's yakitori rumor to frighten Aya to running with no further questions. Aya ended the article in wonderment over the true cause of the fire.

During her interview with Mokou, Aya comes to the conclusion that it must have been Mokou who did it. However, Mokou first repeats that a cigarette butt caused it and then later insists that there never was a fire and threatens that Aya may just end up as yakitori if she keeps saying there was.

;''Cage in Lunatic Runagate'', chapter 4
:{{Main|Cage in Lunatic Runagate/Fourth Chapter|l1=CiLR Chapter 4}}
Mokou goes to [[Keine Kamishirasawa]] to ask her about the smoke rising from the [[Youkai Mountain]]. Keine gives her a lecture on the subject, which makes Mokou reminisce about her past and how she became immortal.

She also worries about the moon rocket that [[Remilia Scarlet]] was building - that [[Kaguya Houraisan]] could possibly be returning to the [[Moon]], and the only other one like Mokou would be gone forever. After eavesdropping on a conversation between Kaguya and [[Eirin Yagokoro]] at [[Eientei]], she discovers that they never planned on going back to the Moon in the first place, and is somewhat relieved.

;''Foul Detective Satori''
While lazing around at the Bamboo Forest of the Lost, Mokou meets an anxious Marisa. After learning about the vengeful ghost haunting Reimu, she, at Marisa's request, guides her to Eientei. They then meet Reisen who existing the current situation at hand. At the same night, Mokou and Marisa break into Eientei to further investigate. While Marisa was incarcerated, Mokou was next seen in the Bamboo Forest, confronting the culprit. She proceeds to fight her, but was ultimately possessed. Her body was later found in the Human Village after the culprit left her body.

==Relationships==
===Kaguya Houraisan===
Mokou has despised [[Kaguya Houraisan]] for reasons mentioned in her [[#Backstory|backstory]]. When she surprisingly found Kaguya in [[Gensokyo]] after so many years of exile, and so close to where she lived, she was ecstatic that Kaguya was in the same mess she was. The two spent about 300 years slaughtering each other on a daily basis; Mokou described those days as "the joys of killing each other over and over" in [[Cage in Lunatic Runagate/Fourth_Chapter|''Cage in Lunatic Runagate'' Chapter 4]]. Mokou's official profile also describes those days as "wonderful days", but she's grown rather annoyed at Kaguya's persistent attempts of trying to kill her, [[assassin]]s or otherwise.&lt;ref name="INBTExtra"&gt;[[Imperishable Night]]: [[Imperishable Night/Translation/Boundary Team's Extra|Boundary Team's Extra]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="INSTExtra"&gt;[[Imperishable_Night/Translation/Scarlet_Team's_Extra|Scarlet Team's Extra]]&lt;/ref&gt;

When Mokou suspects Kaguya is returning to the moon  in ''Cage in Lunatic Runagate'', she is initially worried that the only other immortal person who was in the same situation as her would no longer be on Earth&lt;ref name="CiLRCh4"&gt;[[Cage in Lunatic Runagate]]: [[Cage in Lunatic Runagate/Fourth_Chapter|Chapter 4]]&lt;/ref&gt;, although she does eventually come to terms with the possibility of her leaving. She also comments that had she not taken the elixir, another immortal would have been lonely, implying that despite their feud, she cares for Kaguya in her own way. This was further shown in ''[[Foul Detective Satori]]'' as not only she kept quiet about Kaguya sneaking into the village but would often show her around.&lt;ref&gt; [[Foul Detective Satori]] Chapter 16&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[Keine Kamishirasawa]]===
Mokou seems to have befriended Keine Kamishirasawa, describing her as the one of the few people who can understand her in [[Cage in Lunatic Runagate/Fourth_Chapter|the fourth chapter]] of ''Cage in Lunatic Runagate''. Keine's sense of duty to protect all humans is no exception to Mokou, as she proclaimed to Kaguya's assassins in ''[[Imperishable Night]]'''s extra stage that she won't allow them to lay a hand on Mokou. Keine also traveled together with Mokou to see a flower viewing at the [[Hakurei Shrine]] in the continuation of Chapter 0 of ''[[Eastern and Little Nature Deity]]'' at the end of chapter 3.

===[[Sumireko Usami]]===	
Initially annoyed by the high schooler, Mokou wins the battle finding herself appreciating the girl's power, and feeling a mutual fondness for her. After Sumireko dropped some of her zener cards, Mokou decided to give them back to her as a pretense to meet again. Sumireko feels at ease around her.

===Minor Relationships===
;[[Reimu Hakurei]], [[Marisa Kirisame]], [[Sakuya Izayoi]], [[Yukari Yakumo]], [[Remilia Scarlet]], [[Alice Margatroid]], [[Yuyuko Saigyouji]], and [[Youmu Konpaku]]
Some humans and youkai that were tricked by Kaguya into fighting Mokou during the extra stage of ''[[Imperishable Night]]''. Mokou doesn't have any particularly notable feelings towards most of them (besides being impressed with Alice's knowledge of the Hourai Elixir), but she was flabbergasted with the humans crazy enough to go to the bamboo forest the night of a full moon. ''Cage in Lunatic Runagate'' shows that Mokou thinks Sakuya, Reimu, and Marisa are airheads. Mokou was one of the (many) attendants at Remilia's rocket party in ''[[Silent Sinner in Blue]]''. When Alice fell into the three fairies' trap in the continuation of Chapter 0 of ''[[Eastern and Little Nature Deity]]'' at the end of chapter 3, Mokou and Keine both walked by without freeing her.

; [[Mononobe no Futo]]
Mokou takes an interest in Futo after learning she also had "experienced death once before." Mokou is thrilled by the idea of meeting other [[immortal]]s, and gives the [[Hall of Dreams' Great Mausoleum]] a visit.

;Other Residents of [[Eientei]]
She has a good relationship with Eientei despite her feud with Kaguya, working with the rabbits to stop that forest fire, and is known to lead people to and from Eientei.

;Iwakasa
[[Iwakasa]] was murdered by Mokou in order for her to steal the [[Hourai Elixir]] and become immortal. She notes that one day, she wants to travel to the top of the [[Youkai Mountain]], presumably to see [[Iwanagahime]], the goddess of immortality, and to apologize to her for what she did to [[Iwakasa]]. (NB: The Youkai Mountain was once the mountain Yatsugatake, which is the mountain [[Konohana-Sakuyahime]] suggested to Mokou and Iwakasa to bring the elixir to instead.) [[Imperishable Night/Spell Cards/Extra#Spell Card 199|Spell card #199]] is likely to be referring to [[Iwakasa]], as she implied she felt regret over causing his death. In the [[Cage in Lunatic Runagate/Fourth Chapter|fourth chapter]] of ''Cage in Lunatic Runagate'', it's shown that her immortality was derived indirectly from Iwakasa as well, as he saved her life prior to her immortality.

==Additional Information==
*Mokou appears on the cover of ''[[Imperishable Night]]'', silhouetted against the moon beneath the silhouette of Kaguya.
*Mokou can actually be observed dying and resurrecting after each spell card in ''[[Imperishable Night]]''.
*Mokou would be 1340 years old, give or take 10, to be more precise. The roughly 15 year span that [[wikipedia:Fujiwara no Fuhito|Fujiwara no Fuhito]] had children in would be accurate enough to call Mokou to have been born in this timeframe.
*Mokou was planned to debut as a playable character in ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]'', but the plot involving her and Kaguya was eventually scrapped.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.shrinemaiden.org/forum/index.php?topic=18442.0&lt;/ref&gt;
*Coincidentally, [[Soga no Tojiko]] is based on the rival [[wikipedia:Soga clan|Soga clan]] that the Fujiwara clan took down, known as the [[wikipedia:Isshi Incident|Isshi Incident]]. This is further implied by Tojiko's lightning powers, which is a joke on how Fujiwara was "cursed" by the Soga clan after [[wikipedia:Nakatomi no Kamatari|Nakatomi no Kamatari]], the founder of the Fujiwara clan, was mysteriously struck by lightning after the incident. Whether or not this rivalry is important remains to be seen.
*In the original ''Tale of the Bamboo Cutter'', the immortality elixir given to the Emperor by Kaguya was successfully burned at the top of Mt. Fuji. This made the fire itself immortal, and serves as the mythological explanation for Mt. Fuji's volcanic activity. As this elixir was instead stolen and drunk by Mokou in Touhou canon, she can be thought of as a personification of the flames of Mt. Fuji, which would provide a thematic explanation for her control over fire (if not an in-universe explanation.)

'''Huziwara no Mokou'''

Species: [[Human]]&lt;br /&gt;
Abilities: Neither aging nor dying

A [[human]] who has lived forever since consuming the Hourai Elixir.

Long ago, before she became immortal, she was the daughter of an aristocrat. She wasn't allowed to go out in public, so it seems that she wasn't a wanted child. One day, her father proposed to a commoner girl, but was humiliated because she responded by making an impossible request. That girl was [[Kaguya Houraisan | Kaguya]].

Mokou has hated Kaguya since then, and wanted to take her revenge before Kaguya returned to the moon. She couldn't make it in time, however... She reconciled herself by attempting to steal the pot of medicine that Kaguya left for the emperor of that time.

Oddly, by the time Mokou found the medicine, people were about to throw it into a volcano. She managed to steal it before it was thrown in and consumed it - the Hourai Elixir... That was the last time she was ever seen.

Humans who never age cannot live in the same place for long, so Mokou was forced to live as a wanderer... Humans usually can't survive alone, but she can't die. However, she still suffers from hunger if she doesn't eat and pain if she becomes injured.

Eventually, she chose to live like a forgotten [[youkai]] in a desolate place...

Many long years came to pass.

Now, Mokou and [[Kaguya Houraisan|Kaguya]] kill each other on a daily basis. She was extremely surprised to discover Kaguya in [[Gensokyo]] and so close to where she lived. It's no wonder, though; Kaguya left the Hourai Elixir, one of the moon's most classified secrets, on Earth. She could never expect to return to the moon in peace. Kaguya also had to run. Mokou felt relief beyond what she had ever experienced - Kaguya was in the same mess she was!

Mokou still detests Kaguya, and Kaguya still tries to kill her, but neither of them can die forever. What a meaningful days and nights. This secluded place in a deep mountain is truly the land of Hourai!

How magnificent it is to be alive!

{{nihongo|'''Gengetsu'''|幻月}} is the second Extra Stage boss of ''[[Lotus Land Story]]'' and an inhabitant of the [[Unnamed Dream World|mysterious dream world]]. She's the older sister of [[Mugetsu]].

==Character Design==
===Name===
Her name's {{nihongo||幻月|Gengetsu}}, which means "illusory moon" when the kanji are read separately; read together they mean [[wikipedia:Paraselene|"paraselene" or "moondog"]], which is a type of optical illusion. It's interesting that Gengetsu is the only character in the whole series to use the kanji {{lang|ja|幻}} (''Gen'', lit. ''illusory'') in a name with [[Gensokyo]] ({{lang|ja|幻想郷}}) also using the same kanji. The word "Gensokyo" appears in ''[[Lotus Land Story]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s title name.

===Design===
Gengetsu has yellow eyes, medium-length yellow hair, a red bow in her hair, wears a pink and white dress and a red vest. She also has white wings that resemble an angel's wings. 

==Appearances==
{{Stub|section}}
[[File:Th04GengetsuTrial.png|thumb|160px|Gengetsu in the Trial Version of the game]]
;''Lotus Land Story''
After the final events of ''[[Lotus Land Story]]'' the heroine stumbles upon another strange world which Gengetsu's younger sister [[Mugetsu]] claims to be her world. Once Mugetsu is defeated Gengetsu comes to her aid, even while admitting she doesn't even know why the heroine is there. Little is known about either her or her sister and they appear to have no importance to the story.

:{{Main|Lotus_Land_Story/Translation/Marisa's Extra|l1=Marisa Arc}}
&lt;Insert Summary&gt;

==Relationships==
;[[Mugetsu]] 
It's only known that Gengetsu lives with her younger sister, Mugetsu. Both are relatively young characters as Gengetsu brags (somewhat embarassingly) in Reimu's extra that the duo together are almost as scary as an adult.

==Additional Information==
*The final events of ''Lotus Land Story'' occurred in a "[[Unnamed Dream World|dream world]]". The place [[Mugetsu]] and Gengetsu reside in appears to be yet another dream world.
*Gengetsu is able to fire a laser similar in appearance to the Master Spark.
*Her theme "Cute Devil ~ Innocence" contains a short segment (specifically the intro) of [[Yuuka Kazami]]'s Stage 5 boss theme, "Sleeping Terror".

{{nihongo|'''Genjii'''|玄爺}} is a [[turtle]] that lives at the [[Hakurei Shrine]]. His magical abilities have granted him a long life and the ability to fly, and as [[Reimu Hakurei]] cannot fly under her own power prior to ''[[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]]'', he is used as a platform for Reimu to fly on.

==Character Design==
===Name===
The kanji for ''Gen'' ({{lang|ja|玄}}) literally means 'Black' or 'Mysterious'. The kanji for ''Jii'' ({{lang|ja|爺}}) literally means 'Old Man' or 'Grandfather'.

===Design===
His name '''Genjii''' fits his appearance that of an old [[turtle]] with a grey beard. He is clearly much older than Reimu, and she often refers to him as "Gramps" in order to mock his age (and as a pun on his name).

==Appearances==
{{main|Canon}}
Genjii hasn't appeared in the ''[[Touhou Project]]'' since ''[[Mystic Square]]''. However, [[ZUN]] mentioned in at least two interviews that Genjii is "probably living in the lake at the back of the shrine." In ''[[Strange and Bright Nature Deity]]'' Chapter 12, when Reimu and [[Marisa Kirisame]] were talking about "glowing moss," Reimu said it would be nice to transfer it to the pond in the back of the shrine. Marisa responds that it could grow there on the turtles' backs. It's possible that one of those turtles is Genjii.

==Relationship==
;Reimu Hakurei
{{Stub|section}}

;Yin-Yang Orb
Genjii has a lot of knowledge of the [[Yin-Yang Orb]], but it's unknown how he knows such knowledge.

==Additional Information==
*Genjii only speaks in ''[[Story of Eastern Wonderland]]''.
*Because of his ability to fly and speak he is probably a type of [[youkai]], as animals that live very long usually turn into one.

The {{nihongo|'''Giant [[Namazu|Catfish]]'''|大ナマズ様|Oo Namazu-sama}} is a villainous avatar of [[Taisui Xingjun]], a [[God]] of Calamity who sent [[assassin]]s (disguised as familiar characters) to attack [[Hong Meiling]] in her dreams. Its objective, as it claims, was to drain her of her power so that it could move the Earth and return to this world once again. It also spoke quite strongly of its plans to cause various disasters to [[Gensokyo]]. [[ZUN]] and [[Twilight Frontier]] has left no official comment about the catfish and its gender is unknown.

==Character Basis==
===Origin===
According to [[NKZ]]'s comment in the Nae Raji (radio broadcasting by [[D.N.A. Softwares]]) on September 21. 2009., the inspiration of the catfish is the ''Golden Statue of Catfish'' at [[Wikipedia:Yoshikawa, Saitama|Yoshikawa City]] in [[Wikipedia:Saitama Prefecture|Saitama Prefecture]], where is NKZ's hometown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.city.yoshikawa.saitama.jp/12,392,43,200.html|title=吉川市ってどんな街？|accessdate=23 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Reference needed|Link to radio broadcasting by D.N.A. Softwares}}

While namazu means all catfish in general, it is likely based on ''Silurus asotus'' commonly known as either namazu or chinese catfish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planetcatfish.com/catelog/_species.php?species_id=78|title=Silurus asotus • Siluridae • Cat-eLog • PlanetCatfish • PlanetCatfish.com|accessdate=19 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an [[Interview on Nae Radio (September 2009)|interview]] with [[ZUN]] it was stated that originally, the catfish was planned for ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]'' as the final boss. However, the final boss eventually became [[Tenshi Hinanawi]].

===Name===
This character once referred to itself as the {{nihongo|''Giant [[Namazu|Catfish]]''|大ナマズ}}, but it doesn't mean it's this catfish's official name. {{nihongo|"Catfish"|ナマズ|namazu}} refers to its species. In addition to this, The graphics files for the catfish are named "[[namazu]]" in the ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]'' application directory, extending the prove of its species.

The {{nihongo||大|oo|also ''dai''}} has many synonyms when translated to English, such as "giant", "large", "vast", "huge" or simply "big". The catfish additionally adds the honorific {{nihongo||様|-sama|lit, "sir" or "madam"}}, a very formal gender-neutral suffix that's only used in high respect, referencing the fact that the catfish is referring to itself as high and mighty.

===Design===
The sprite of the catfish in ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]'' shows that it has glossy, yellowish-brown flesh, bulbous eyes, single protruding dorsal fin, and whiskers.

==Story==
;''Touhou Hisoutensoku''
{{Main|Touhou Hisoutensoku/Translation/Meiling's Scenario#Stage Final|l1=Touhou Hisoutensoku Story}}

The catfish's main goal is to send [[assassin]]s to [[Hong Meiling]] to drain her power, which are pseudo-characters of [[Alice Margatroid]], [[Marisa Kirisame]] and [[Reimu Hakurei]] respectively. However, they were defeated, so the catfish reveals it to Meiling and claims it want to cause various disasters to [[Gensokyo]]; it was up to Meiling to stop the catfish. After a harsh battle, the catfish was defeated, but it was later revealed it was all a dream.

;''Antinomy of Common Flowers''

A visually identical but proportionally smaller catfish appears in spellcards used by [[Tenshi Hinanawi]] from the [[Dream World]]. It is unknown if this is implied to be the same catfish.

==Spell Cards==
The naming of the [[spell card]]s are considered rather childish and that they don't truly appear to reflect the rules of spell cards due to being rather meaningless attacks. They mostly involve the catfish causing various earthquakes and using [[danmaku]] at a minimum. On some view, they can be considered "non-[[canon]]" in terms of story due to only being used in Meiling's dream.

==Additional Information==
*Carp-like monster fish up to ten fathoms in length have been seen in the [[Misty Lake]] where the [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]] is located.&lt;ref name="PMiSSMystic"&gt;[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]: [[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Misty Lake|Mystic Lake]]&lt;/ref&gt; This may be the kind of fish [[Sakuya Izayoi]] caught at the end of ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]''.
*The catfish is one of the very few characters who has objectives that are truly antagonistic towards [[Gensokyo]]. 
*Some of the attacks of the catfish are a reference to the attacks of Fatty Whale from ''[[Wikipedia:Kirby Super Star|Kirby Super Star]]'' and ''Kirby Super Star Ultra''.
*The catfish is the only character who appears as a boss in a fighting spin-off, but is not a playable character.
*He is the only character in ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]'' whose face is not visible in his HUD portrait.

The {{nihongo|'''Goliath Doll'''|ゴリアテ人形|Goriate ningyō}} is a giant [[doll]] in [[Alice Margatroid]]'s final [[spell card]] in ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]''. She is known to be the most powerful of Alice's dolls, but not much is really known about her.

==Character Design==
===Name===
Her name ''Goliath Doll'' hasn't been confirmed by [[ZUN]] to be official, so such name is derived by fans from the [[spell card]] she appears in: [[Touhou Hisoutensoku/Spell Cards/Alice Margatroid#Spell Card Story Mode 5|''Testing "Goliath Doll"'']]. [[wikipedia:Goliath|Goliath]] is a figure in the [[wikipedia:Hebrew Bible|Hebrew Bible]], a Philistine champion known for his duel to the death with the the future king of Israel, [[wikipedia:David|David]]. He is described as a giant, standing over 2.7 meters tall, but was defeated by the young David with a single slung stone to the head. In English, his name is used figuratively to refer to something very large and menacing.

===Design===
The sprite of the Goliath Doll in ''Touhou Hisoutensoku'' shows that she has blonde hair and blue eyes. She wears a dark grey colored dress with a white apron with dark grey sleeves along with dark grey shoes. The bows on her head and dress are colored in red and she appears to have two large swords. She also seems to be taller than a two-story house.

==Story==
;''Touhou Hisoutensoku''
{{Main|Touhou Hisoutensoku/Translation/Cirno's Scenario#Stage Final|l1=Touhou Hisoutensoku Story}}
As [[Cirno]] asking [[Marisa Kirisame]] if she saw a "[[Daidarabotchi]]", she points to the [[Forest of Magic]] that a big figure occurred within. Cirno goes over and encounters [[Alice Margatroid]], who figures that she can test this doll on her with the [[spell card]] [[Touhou Hisoutensoku/Spell Cards/Alice Margatroid#Spell Card Story Mode 5|''Testing "Goliath Doll"'']]. After a 60 second countdown, both Alice and the doll were defeated, with the latter exploding in a catastrophic failure. Despite not being the aforementioned, it ended up being the "Daidarabotchi" Cirno was looking for.

==Relationships==
She's one of [[Alice Margatroid]] dolls, who is a puppeteer, described as her strongest doll she's ever created. It's unknown if Alice still uses her. 

==Additional Information==
*If playing on Lunatic, each hit with the swords can take out over ⅓ of your health, which means after 3 hits you lose a whole [[health bar]].

The true identity of '''The God of the [[Hakurei Shrine]]''' is obscure; even [[Reimu Hakurei]], its supposed shrine maiden, does not know its name or blessings. As a result she is unable to supply it with faith, much to its frustration. While no longer strong enough to keep youkai away from the shrine, it can still express its blessing of youkai extermination through its [[wikipedia:goshintai|go-shintai]], the [[Yin-Yang Orb]]s.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oriental Sacred Place]]'' chapter 17&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Hata no Kokoro'''|秦 こころ}} is the main antagonist of [[Hopeless Masquerade]] and a [[menreiki]] [[youkai]]. She relies on her masks to show her emotions to others, as her actual face is emotionless and can be likened to a poker face.

==General Information==
Kokoro first appeared as the Final [[Boss]] of ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'', later appearing in ''[[Urban Legend in Limbo]]'' as a playable character.

===Personality===
Kokoro naturally has a quiet, child-like personality but also a love of the stage, and relies on her masks to properly communicate her emotions. These emotions can be said to be stored inside the masks, as when she lost the Mask of Hope, her behavior became erratic. Before that, though, she was very quiet and hardly let any emotion show. After the events of ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'', she manages to stabilize her personality by developing a sense of self.

===Abilities===
;Manipulating emotions
Each of the masks which make up Kokoro embodies powerful emotion, and will impress that emotion on the holder and those around them. When all 66 masks are together, their effects complement each other and are under Kokoro's full control. If an individual mask is separated from the group, it retains its properties, but Kokoro will lose the ability to feel that emotion completely. Losing her Mask of Hope caused Kokoro to become unstable and leech hope from her surroundings, until she was able to compensate by developing emotions separate from her masks'.

===Possessions===
Kokoro has a total of 66 masks, each depicting an individual emotion. During the events of ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'', she is unable to express emotions without using these masks. Typically, she just uses the masks that represent joy, anger, pathos, and humor. These masks were created by [[Toyosatomimi no Miko]], who later creates a replacement Mask of Hope modeled on her own face.
The masks Kokoro uses at some point in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'' and their most likely corresponding emotions:

* [[Hannya mask‎|Hannya]]: Anger
* [http://www.the-noh.com/sub/jp/index.php?mode=db&amp;action=e_view_detail&amp;data_id=32&amp;class_id=1 {{nihongo|Old woman||Uba}}]: Pathos, melancholy
* [http://nohmask21.com/mask-v/fukunokami.html {{nihongo|God of happiness||Fuku no kami}}]: Humor, laughter
* [[wikipedia:Hyottoko|Hyottoko]]: Cheerful
* [http://nohmask21.com/saru.html Monkey]: Confusion, awkwardness
* [http://nohmask21.com/raiden.html {{nihongo|Thunder and lightning||Raiden}}]: Surprise
* Fox: Determination, seriousness

In addition to this, Kokoro has a [[wikipedia:en:Naginata|Naginata]], which she uses a weapon.

Kokoro's original Mask of Hope is described by Koishi, who possesses it, as resembling a [http://www.yesicanusechopsticks.com/jizo/index.htm Jizo statue].&lt;ref&gt;From [[Hopeless Masquerade/Story/Koishi's Scenario|Koishi's Scenario, Stage 7]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kokoro briefly uses a number of substitute Masks of Hope as part of her attempts to stabilise her emotions, including festival masks (which are not very effective), and a mask specially crafted by Miko herself (which is ''too'' effective, and would cause her to stop existing as a youkai).

==Backstory==
Hata no Kokoro is a [[menreiki]], a type of [[tsukumogami]], born from 66 masks used by [[wikipedia:Hata no Kawakatsu|Hata no Kawakatsu]] in the sixth century. The masks themselves all became tsukumogami, and eventually coalesced into the youkai Kokoro, and appeared in [[Gensokyo]] at some point.

Before the events of ''Hopeless Masquerade'', she somehow lost her Mask of Hope. This caused the entire [[Human Village]] to start losing hope, and sparked the events that occur in the game. At first, she tried to balance the rest of the emotions of her masks, but losing just the one ended up driving her berserk.

==Character Design==
===Origin===
Hata no Kawakatsu is known as the father of [[wikipedia:Sarugaku|Sarugaku]] theatre (a precursor to [[wikipedia:Noh|Noh]]), and is the centre of a legend which would connect him to [[Mononobe no Futo]], [[Toyosatomimi no Miko]], [[Myouren Temple]], and perhaps even [[Moriya Shrine]].

In the legend, as told in [[wikipedia:Zeami|Zeami]]'s [[wikipedia:Zeami#Fūshikaden|Fūshikaden]], Kawakatsu was found in a jar as a baby on a river near [[wikipedia:Ōmiwa jinja|Oomiwa Shrine]] during the reign of Emperor Kinmei. He grew up to be a genius, so the court made him a minister and given the surname Hata. When the country was in turmoil, Prince Shoutoku ordered Kawakatsu to perform 66 plays following [[Shinto]] and [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] traditions, and had 66 masks made for this purpose. These plays became the first [[wikipedia:Kagura|Kagura]], from which [[wikipedia:Sarugaku|Sarugaku]] was later derived.

After passing down the secret of his plays, Kawakatsu rode a boat and drifted out to the sea to uphold the tradition that non-human deities and [[Buddha]]s mustn't leave physical remains. He next came ashore in monstrous form, and haunted the surrounding area until he was enshrined by the local people as {{nihongo|Great Rage Daimyoujin|大荒大明神|Taikou Daimyoujin}}, who was later regarded as an avatar of [[Bishamonten]].
[[File:FSHata.png|thumb|right|150px|Hata no Kokoro's appearance in [[Forbidden Scrollery]]]]

===Name===
Her full name is ''Hata no Kokoro'', with Hata as the surname and Kokoro as the given name. [[wikipedia:Hata clan|Hata]] (the Japanese reading of Chinese surname Qin {{lang|ja|秦}}) clan was an eminent Chinese immigrant clan mentioned in Nihon Shoki. It's also the surname of the masks' original user — Hata no Kawakatsu, who's said to be the reincarnation of [[Wikipedia:Qin Shi Huang|First Emperor of Qin Dynasty]] in Zeami's Fuushika-den.

Her given name is written entirely in hiragana and means {{nihongo|'Heart'|心|kokoro}} in Japanese. {{lang|ja|心}} is also in the Japanese title of the game about her: {{nihongo|''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]''|心綺楼|shinkirou}}.

===Design===
Kokoro has waist-length lavender hair, and blank eyes of the same colour. She wears a blue plaid blouse, adorned with buttons of various shapes (from top: red star, yellow circle, green triangle, and purple X). Her salmon-coloured skirt is pumpkin-shaped, and lined with holes in the shape of alternating smiling and frowning faces (both are the same pattern, flipped vertically). She always wears one of her 66 masks over some of her face.

==Appearances==
===Games===
;''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]''
The story starts with Kokoro losing her mask of hope, causing the emotions embodied in her remaining masks to go berserk and begin draining the hope from the [[Human Village]]. This in turn leads the humans to latch onto religious leaders as sources of hope, as part of the "duelling fad".

[[Reimu Hakurei]] and the others participate in the religious popularity contest and are eventually guided by [[Mamizou Futatsuiwa]] to the Human Village at night, where Kokoro searches in vain for her lost mask. Most of the characters who try to stop her come up with their own solutions to her hopelessness, including [[Byakuren Hijiri]] teaching her Buddhism to control her own emotions and [[Toyosatomimi no Miko]] making her a replacement mask of hope, but none of them completely work.

Mamizou notices the contradictory actions Kokoro is taking and offers her own advice, which is to stop relying on the masks and discover her own, true emotions through meeting (and fighting) a variety of people. In the process of doing so she discovers her own anger at the religious leaders who are taking advantage of the situation, and Reimu, Byakuren, and Miko team up to stop her. Byakuren and Miko both claim that their solutions solved the problem, and Kokoro is invited to the [[Hakurei Shrine]] to perform [[wikipedia:Kagura|Kagura]] as an offering to the gods.
;''[[Urban Legend in Limbo]]''
The story begins with Kokoro imitating the Kuchisake-onna and asking various people if she was pretty, with those people trying to repel her by saying the word [[wikipedia:Pomade|pomade]], but it doesn't work with Kokoro saying that she is the "new and improved Kuchisake-onna" and attacks them. Nitori, one of the people she encounters, reminds her that she is a mask youkai and it's later revealed that one of Kokoro's masks was cracked. 

Kokoro opts to get Miko to fix the mask, only for [[Mononobe no Futo]] to tell her that she was away at the shrine doing some important business. Futo then notices the [[occult ball]]s that Kokoro possessed. She then wonders why Kokoro would be possessing occult balls as Miko was supposed to have collected them all. Futo then decides she'll take the balls from Kokoro and give them to Miko. After being defeated, Kokoro asks Futo is she was pretty before continuing her quest to find Miko. When Kokoro finally encounters her, Miko tells her that she was busy and cannot fix her mask at the moment. Miko notices the occult balls Kokoro had as well, and tries to defeat Kokoro for them, but fails. Kokoro then heads back to the human village to practice her Kuchisake-onna routine, and after finding out that the Kuchisake-onna attacks her victims regardless of whether they say she's pretty or not, decides to skip the question and attack right away. Afterwards, [[Sumireko Usami]] comes up to her and after Kokoro notices her foreign weapons and abilities, she feels the emotion of surprise for the first time in a while.

;''[[Antinomy of Common Flowers]]''
In ''[[Antinomy of Common Flowers]]'', Kokoro lends [[Nitori Kawashiro]] her power over emotions to aid in the reverse engineering of Perfect Posession.

Kokoro's [[Dream World]] self appears in [[Tenshi Hinanawi]]'s scenario, very angry at the celestial's personality.

===Literature===
;''[[Forbidden Scrollery]]''
Sometime during the ending of her ''Hopeless Masquerade'' route, Kokoro performs Noh at the [[Hakurei Shrine]] in an attempt to stabilise her emotions, hiding her identity as a [[youkai]]. While popular at first, audiences are unable to understand her "play", which turns out to be based on illustrations from an old tengu parody. Noticing this, [[Mamizou]] approaches Kokoro and helps write ''[[Shinkirou]]'', a modernised comedy based on the events of the religious war.

==Relationships==
;[[Toyosatomimi no Miko]]
While she was still alive, Miko created the 66 masks which Kokoro was born from. Miko later makes Kokoro a new mask of hope to replace her lost one. However, Kokoro discarded this mask, as its stabilising effect was so powerful that it would eventually cause her to turn back into a set of inanimate objects. Her feelings towards Miko over this are unknown.
;[[Mamizou Futatsuiwa]]
Mamizou keeps an eye on Kokoro during the events of ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'' and gives her some advice to help her develop her emotions. Afterwards she helps write ''[[Shinkirou]]'' for Kokoro to perform.
;[[Koishi Komeiji]]
Kokoro considers Koishi her arch-enemy, for finding her old Mask of Hope and refusing to return it.

Hata no Kokoro

Species: Menreiki&lt;br /&gt;
Ability: Ability to manipulate emotion

A youkai created, after a long time had passed, from the masks used&lt;br /&gt;
by the father of Sarugaku performance, Hata no Kawakatsu.&lt;br /&gt;
Each mask depicts an emotion, and putting on a mask will change one's emotions.&lt;br /&gt;
Those emotions influence those around the wearer, as well.

She has a total of sixty-six masks.

Each and every mask has an emotion assigned to it, but since there are quite too many,&lt;br /&gt;
she normally only uses the masks for the four emotions of joy, anger, pathos, and humor.


Because her story is discussed in detail in-game this time, not all of it will be discussed here,&lt;br /&gt;
but the incident began with her "Mask of Hope" being lost.&lt;br /&gt;
The reason why it was lost is unknown (probably just an accident), but its influence&lt;br /&gt;
is what caused the sudden rioting.

Originally, she stabilized herself by having each emotion hold their balance with each other,&lt;br /&gt;
but losing just one mask caused her emotions' original powers to interfere with each other, and she went berserk.

In fact, when she's stabilized, she hardly lets any emotions show. She shows interest in nothing,&lt;br /&gt;
and aside from when her masks are required, she just quietly acts as a tsukumogami.&lt;br /&gt;
Because of that, some say that when she goes berserk, she seems more human-like.

{{nihongo|'''Hatate Himekaidou'''|姫海棠　はたて|Himekaidou Hatate}} is the deuteragonist of [[Double Spoiler]]. She's a [[tengu]] reporter who produces the [[Kakashi Spirit News]]. Unlike her colleague [[Aya Shameimaru]], she never goes outside for her newspaper research. Instead, she uses her ability called {{nihongo|[[wikipedia:Thoughtography|thoughtography]]|念写|nensha}}. After reading Aya's [[Bunbunmaru Newspaper]], she decided to observe Aya's way of gathering for her articles. She first appeared in ''[[Double Spoiler]]'' and subsequently has only appeared in spin-off games.

==General Information==
===Personality===
Hatate is a perky, casual speaking, fun-loving, crow tengu who greatly dislikes working. She is known as a shut-in who prefers to stay indoors, using thoughtography to collect information for her articles. She holds a strong discontent towards the rigid tengu caste system and greatly resents the workload placed upon her. 

In contrast to her outward personality, her articles are very informative and thoughtful. She’s a nonconformist who writes from an innovative and progressive viewpoint. For instance, in [[Alternative Facts in Eastern Utopia]], Hatate wrote an article describing the technological benefits outsiders like [[Sumireko Usami]] could bring to Gensokyo.

===Ability===
;Spirit photography
Hatate's ability allows her to be aware of distant happenings. Her thoughtography is similar to telegnosis, with the addition of being able to take pictures with it. She takes pictures by inputting keywords into her camera, which brings up the associated photos. With this ability, Hatate can gather information and pictures without ever having to leave her room. This makes it a very convenient ability for journalism but because thoughtography relies on what has already been heard, the articles Hatate writes lack speed and freshness.

===Possessions===
;Galapagos Phone
Hatate makes use an old-fashioned mobile flip phone called a Galapagos Phone. It's main function is to take pictures as well as a conduit for her abilities.

==Character Design==
===Name===
Her full name is {{nihongo|''Hatate Himekaidou''|姫海棠　はたて}}. The kanji for {{nihongo|姫海棠|Himekaidou}} mean "princess", "sea/beach" and "crabapple tree" respectively. ''Himekaidou'' itself is a kind of [[Wikipedia:Malus sieboldii|toringo crabapple]]. ''[[Wikipedia:Hime kaidō|Hime kaidou]]'' also refers to a side-road, often taken by women or travelers who wanted to avoid thieves.

===Design===
Hatate is shown to have brown eyes, and long brown hair in pigtails with purple ribbons. She wears a pinkish shirt with purple trim on the collar and a thin black tie, a black band around one arm, a purple tokin, a skirt in black/purple checker pattern with a floral pattern on the purple, a small brown pouch on her hip, thigh-high black socks (which are rolled down just below her knees), and pale purple-ish red geta sandals with purple straps. She carries a camera, looking like a modern cell phone, with a yellow/dark yellow checker pattern, a heart on it, and a brush hanging from it like a charm. Just like Aya, she is also shown to have pointed ears in her Double Spoiler artwork.

Hatate's clothes have a lot of purple color. Purple color symbolizes "mystic" or "royalty". "Mystic" might be associated with her spiritual powers. "Royalty" might refer to ''Himekaidou'' - princess. It may be also a reference to the deadly sin, "pride".

==Story==
===Spin-off games===
;''Double Spoiler''
[[File:Th125HatateBackSprite.png|frame|left|Hatate's back sprite in ''DS'']]
[[File:Th125HatateSprite.png|frame|Hatate's sprite in ''DS'']]
:{{Main|Double Spoiler#Story|l1=Double Spoiler Story}}
In ''[[Double Spoiler]]'', Hatate appeared as a Spoiler [[stage]] target (after the Extra stage), who confronts Aya, and has a picture-taking showdown with her, all the while debating the pros of her journalistic style and the cons of Aya's journalistic style, forcing Aya to take photos of her [[spell card]]s. Hatate has a unique way of [[danmaku]], and that is taking her own photo's of Aya's [[hit box]]. If defeated, Hatate becomes the second playable character, having to re-visit all the cast characters and take photos of their spell cards Aya has already covered, hence the word "Double" in the game's title. The gameplay with Hatate is extremely similar to Aya's, with minor differences.

;''Hopeless Masquerade''
[[File:Th135Hatate.png|frame|Hatate in ''HM'']]
Hatate made a background cameo appearance in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'' on the [[Myouren Temple]] and [[Genbu Ravine]] stage. She is seen standing on top of the temple in the former and on a pipe in the latter, taking photographs with her thoughtography camera.

;''Impossible Spell Card''
In ''[[Impossible Spell Card]]'', Hatate (been one of the [[tengu]] mentioned by [[Mamizou Futatsuiwa]]) takes notice of minorities trying to capture the mischief-making [[amanojaku]] [[Seija Kijin]], who also appears to be one of the many [[youkai]] that tries to capture her on day 6. She uses [[spell card]]s that are considered impossible to dodge. She apparently writes up an article about this, which makes stronger [[human]]s and [[youkai]] try to capture Seija.

===Literature===
;''Wild and Horned Hermit''
In ''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'', she and [[Aya Shameimaru]] appear to be covering [[Kanako Yasaka]]'s nuclear reactor experiment, which may point to Hatate trying to collect field data.

==Relationships==
;[[Aya Shameimaru]]
As of ''[[Double Spoiler]]'', Hatate regards Aya as a rival newspaper writer and competitor.

===Minor Relationships===
;[[Momiji Inubashiri]]
Hatate appears to somewhat admire her colleague Momiji Inubashiri's senses of sight and smell, and is rather impressed by her [[spell card]]s.

;[[Tenma]]
Hatate's chief is Tenma.

;[[Megumu Iizunamaru]]
Megumu is the Chief of the Crow Tengu, which makes her Hatate's superior.

==Additional Information==
*A silhouette of Hatate occupies the front of [[Double Spoiler]]'s jewel case.
*Her thoughtography camera closely resembles a cell phone of some sort. It was apparently made by the [[kappa]]. It is possible that the kappa reverse-engineered something left behind by someone who was spirited away to [[Gensokyo]].
*The articles on her in [[Alternative Facts in Eastern Utopia]] imply that she is younger than Aya.

&lt;br /&gt;
Himekaidou Hatate

Race: Crow Tengu&lt;br /&gt;
Ability: Spirit photography.&lt;br /&gt;

Hatate is a reporter that never goes outside for her newspaper research.&lt;br /&gt;
She takes pictures using thoughtography and uses them for her articles.&lt;br /&gt;

Hatate's thoughtography works by inputting keywords for her camera, which she uses to find associated photos.&lt;br /&gt;

She doesn't feel the need to go outside because this is convenient.&lt;br /&gt;

The newspaper she writes, ''Kakashi Spirit News'', has never been that popular.&lt;br /&gt;
This is only natural, for the articles she wrote were things people had heard of already.&lt;br /&gt;
Thoughtography lacks speed and freshness.&lt;br /&gt;

Then Hatate read Aya's ''Bunbunmaru Newspaper''.&lt;br /&gt;

"These articles are utter nonsense, but why do they have this strange appeal? Why is it that its headlines never overlap with other newspapers'?"&lt;br /&gt;

In order to find out Aya's secret, Hatate decided to observe her.&lt;br /&gt;

That was when she found out Aya's secret.&lt;br /&gt;
Aya wasn't covering events; Aya was causing the events themselves.

{{nihongo|'''Hecatia Lapislazuli'''|ヘカーティア・ラピスラズリ|Hekātia Rapisurazuri}} is a [[God|Goddess]] of [[Hell]]. She first appeared as an Extra Stage Boss in ''[[Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom]]'', and has made further appearances in the print works ''[[Alternative Facts in Eastern Utopia]]'', ''[[Grimoire of Usami]]'', and ''[[Visionary Fairies in Shrine]]''.

==General Information==
===Personality===

According to [[Eiki Shiki]], Hecatia is eccentric but relatively not evil compared to most denizens of [[Hell]].&lt;ref name="Fairy5"&gt;{{cite web |title=Reimu's Tour of Hell|author=ZUN|publisher=Comp Ace|date=26 January 2017|work=東方三月精　～ Visionary Fairies in Shrine.第5話|url=https://mangadex.org/chapter/69853372-1119-443b-a736-6dd8b86a65c7|access-date=October 5, 2021 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She seems capable of being caring and compassionate, especially towards her underlings (namely [[Clownpiece]]). Additionally, it might be possible that her personality changes when she switches between her three bodies.&lt;ref name="SCoOW1"&gt;[[Strange Creators of Outer World/Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom interview with ZUN|Strange Creators of Outer World - Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom interview with ZUN]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hecatia has an unwavering desire for personal freedom and dislikes authoritarians of any sort (somewhat matching her "unconventional" appearance). In particular, she has a strong distaste for the [[Lunarians]], considering them to be the antithesis to her ideology.&lt;ref name="AFiEU1"&gt;[[Alternative Facts in Eastern Utopia]] - Interview with Hecatia Lapislazuli&lt;/ref&gt; However, it's not known whether this specific dislike of them was due to her own personal motivations, or if she was convinced to hate them due to her close relationship with [[Junko]].

===Abilities and Possessions===
;Ability to have three bodies
Hecatia's ability allows her to exist on Earth, the [[Moon]], and the Otherworlds all at once with different bodies, while her core soul resides in [[Hell]]. As places like Gensokyo and the [[Dream World]] are Otherworlds, Hecatia can access these as well. She can switch between them by wearing the respective astronomical objects on her polos. She can also summon them to essentially give herself clones. &lt;ref&gt; [[Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom/Story/Reimu's Extra|Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom - Reimu's Extra]] &lt;/ref&gt;

==Background Information==
Her full name is {{nihongo|''Hecatia Lapislazuli''|ヘカーティア・ラピスラズリ}}. Her given name, Hecatia, is derived from [[wikipedia:Hecate|Hecate]] ({{lang|el|Ἑκάτη}}, Hekátē), the Greek goddess, whom Hecatia is believed to be based on. Her last name, Lapislazuli, is the name of [[wikipedia:Lapis lazuli|a stone]] prized since antiquity for its rich, deep-blue color.

| image3 = Th15HecatiaYellowSprite.png
| caption3 = Hecatia's Moon body
}}
===Origin===
She seems to be based on [[wikipedia:Hecate|Hecate]], who was associated with the underworld in myth through forms of magic, like witchcraft, necromancy, and sorcery, ghosts, thresholds and crossroads, and the border between worlds. She was also associated with dogs, light, the Moon, and knowledge of herbs and poisonous plants. Her Roman depiction, [[wikipedia:Trivia (mythology)|Trivia]], was similar, along with being associated with graveyards. Hecate is also commonly depicted with three heads or bodies, representing crossroads.

===Design===
Hecatia appears within the Dream World with red eyes and hair. She is fairly modern looking, wearing a short, three-colored, plaid skirt, and a black t-shirt with ''"Welcome ❤ Hell"'' written on the front, worn off her shoulders. She also wears a collar, with chains attached, each one leading to an orb of the [[Moon]], the [[wikipedia:Earth|Earth]], and an orb representing the Otherworlds, the last of which sits in her hat atop her head. During the course of her fight, her hair and eyes turn blue or blonde as she switches the Otherworld orb with the Earth or Moon orbs respectively. As it mentioned in the liner notes to her theme, her outfit is inspired by Death Metal. ZUN thought of the process "[[Hell]] -&gt; [[Shinigami]] (death gods) -&gt; Death -&gt; Death Metal".&lt;ref name="LoLK"&gt;''[[Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom]]'' : [[Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom/Music|Music Room]]&lt;/ref&gt; Although she is shown barefoot in her in-game portraits and various manga appearances, she is seen wearing boots in Chapter 13 of [[Visionary Fairies in Shrine]].

==Hecatia's Appearances==
===Games===
;''Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom''
Hecatia appears as the main Extra Stage boss of Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom. It's explained that she joined forces with [[Junko]] to bring an end to the hegemony of the [[Lunarians]] in the [[Lunar Capital]]. Her trump card, if [[Clownpiece]] and Junko had failed in their invasion of the Lunar Capital, was to trap the Lunarians in the Dream World and hold them hostage, hoping that it would provoke an attack of some kind, which she could use to her advantage. She did not know that the Lunarians had threatened to wipe out all life on Earth, including [[Gensokyo]], forcing the protagonist to begrudgingly fight for the Lunarians. 

In the final battle, Hecatia and Junko joined forces to fight the protagonist together side-by-side.

During [[Marisa Kirisame]]'s route, she mentions that she hates the leader of the moon rabbits, [[Chang'e]], because "''she is the wife of the guy who killed one of my stars"&lt;ref&gt;[[Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom/Story/Marisa's Extra|Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom Extra Stage (Marisa Run)]]&lt;/ref&gt;''. Said star, namely Apollo,&lt;ref&gt;[[Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom]] - Hecatia's profile&lt;/ref&gt;, seems to be one of the suns shot down by Hou Yi. If the sun is weakened, Hell would also be affected as shadows would become weaker as well.

===Literature===
;''Visionary Fairies in Shrine''
Shortly after the events of [[Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom]], Hecatia brought [[Clownpiece]] to [[Gensokyo]] and asked her to stay there and get used to the place.&lt;ref&gt;[[Visionary Fairies in Shrine]] - Chapter 4&lt;/ref&gt; In Chapter 10, Hecatia appears in Gensokyo again to check on Clownpiece, and assigns her a new task asking her to encounter more lifeforce, especially from things that aren't often seen in [[Hell]]. In Chapter 13, she meets [[Reimu Hakurei]] and [[Marisa Kirisame]], and talks with them about the stone cherries that are appearing in Gensokyo, affirming that those stones are nothing but the crystallization of the missing fairies' lifeforce, and saying that she wants to take them with her to Hell.
;''Alternative Facts in Eastern Utopia''
In ''Alternative Facts in Eastern Utopia'', [[Aya Shameimaru]] interviewed Hecatia about the recent arrival of denizens of Hell, such as [[Clownpiece]], in [[Gensokyo]].&lt;ref name="AFiEU1"&gt;[[Alternative Facts in Eastern Utopia]] - Interview with Hecatia Lapislazuli&lt;/ref&gt; In the interview, Aya expressed cynical views towards Hecatia and her cohort, wondering if they weren't planning some sort of invasion into Gensokyo to take it over and destroy its "charming atmosphere." Hecatia rebuked Aya and told her that maintaining an isolationist attitude would make Gensokyo no better than the [[Lunar Capital]], and that Gensokyo had always relied on new youkai to ensure its culture didn't become stagnate and stale, echoing sentiments from an earlier interview with [[Yukari Yakumo]]. Hecatia also harshly chided Aya for frequently stretching and abusing the truth to gain attention and newspaper sales through [[Wikipedia:Clickbait|manufactured outrage]]. Aya was apparently so disturbed by the interview that she decided not to publish it, and ended up cancelling that edition of her newspaper entirely.

==Relationships==
;[[Junko]]
Hecatia, like her would-be friend Junko, has a grudge with [[Chang'e]]. It was Chang'e's husband who shot down the suns, weakening the shadows of Hell as a consequence. However, it mostly seems to be through Junko's influence that her grudge exists. Because she sympathized with Junko, she decides to side with her in ''Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom''.

;[[Clownpiece]]
Clownpiece is a subordinate of Hecatia, who allows Junko to use Clownpiece in her scheme against the [[Lunar Capital]]. Hecatia seems especially fond of her, letting her have a "vacation" in Gensokyo as a reward for finishing her "big job" in [[Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom]].

;[[Eiki Shiki]]
She has only heard of her and her eccentricities and has yet to meet her personally.&lt;ref name="[[Visionary Fairies in Shrine]]"&gt;"Reimu's Tour of Hell" (Chapter 5), [[Visionary Fairies in Shrine]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://clarste.tumblr.com/post/190235227621&lt;/ref&gt;

==Additional Information==
*Due to Junko sometimes jumping in during the fight, Hecatia has the lowest number of [[spell card]]s as an extra stage [[boss]]. Most extra bosses will have ten, but Hecatia has eight.
*According to ZUN, Hecatia is "completely past the level of anyone in [[Gensokyo]] or the [[Lunar Capital]]."&lt;ref name="SCoOW1"/&gt;

　　ちなみに夢の世界は異界に相当する。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;


　　彼女も嫦娥に怨みを持つ神様である。&lt;br&gt;
　　何故なら、嫦娥の夫は、太陽（アポロ）を撃ち落とした人物だからだ。&lt;br&gt;

Hecatia Lapislazuli&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Species: God&lt;br&gt;
Ability: Capable of having three bodies&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

A mysterious god who governs the Hells of the moon, the Earth, and Otherworlds.&lt;br&gt;
She has a separate body in each of the three worlds, and can act independently with each of them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Also, since the Moon, Earth, and Otherworlds each have their own Hell, and her core soul resides in Hell,&lt;br&gt;
she's a rather troublesome god who can't easily be retaliated against if viewed as an enemy.&lt;br&gt;
The Dream World falls under 'Otherworlds', by the way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

She too is a god who hates Chang'e.&lt;br&gt;
Because, you see, Chang'e's husband was the person who shot down the suns (ie. Apollo).&lt;br&gt;
In the first place, Hell would be unable to exist without the sun.&lt;br&gt;
Without strong light, the darkness of Hell would weaken too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

...that said, though, her hatred of Chang'e is mostly due to Junko's influence anyway.&lt;br&gt;
Junko's current plan required someone who could freely control fairies, as well as someone&lt;br&gt;
who could freely move to and from the Dream World.&lt;br&gt;
Those conditions fit her perfectly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

She and Junko hit it off immediately.&lt;br&gt;
It was to her merit that she greatly enjoyed fighting to begin with.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

She also allowed Junko to freely use her subordinate, Clownpiece.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

And so, the moon's people escaped into the Dream World.&lt;br&gt;
She filled the surroundings of the Dream World's fake Lunar Capital with life.&lt;br&gt;
Thus, the People of the Moon were completely suppressed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

All that was left was to shoot down Chang'e...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

but, all of a sudden she received a notice of defeat from Junko.&lt;br&gt;
It seemed that the People of the Moon came up with a strategy that ran circles around hers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Namely: a purified human who had become free from death.&lt;br&gt;
The strategy to send a "Human of the Ultramarine Orb" to the moon.

{{nihongo|'''Hieda no Akyuu'''|稗田　阿求}} is the main protagonist of ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'' and the current {{nihongo|"[[Child of Miare]]"|御阿礼の子}}, who is born in the Hieda family once in every 120 to 180 years with the ability to "not forget anything she sees" and records [[Gensokyo]]'s history. She seems to like red tea and [[wikipedia:Frequency modulation synthesis|FM Synthesis]] music.

==General Information==
Akyuu first appeared as the main protagonist of ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'' along with the spinoff manga ''[[Memorizable Gensokyo]]''. She starred in her own ''[[Akyu's Untouched Score]]'' series, which is a collection of tracks from the [[PC-98]] games. She appears in ''[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]]'' recording all the events and appeared in ''[[Forbidden Scrollery]]'' as a secondary character. Additionally, she's appeared in various cameos in other mangas such as ''[[Silent Sinner in Blue]]'', ''[[Oriental Sacred Place]]'', ''[[Inaba of the Moon and Inaba of the Earth]]'' and ''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]''.

Hieda is the ninth in a long chain of reincarnations of the "[[Child of Miare]]". Because of this, her memory goes back over 1200 years despite her young age. Historically, the role of the Children of Miare has been to collect and compile information on the various [[youkai]] and youkai hunters living in [[Gensokyo]], as well as to compile historical articles, which are published as part of the [[Gensokyo Chronicle]].

Akyuu is physically only ten years old at the time ''Perfect Memento in Strict Sense'' was published, and doesn't have a very long lifespan, presumably because of the reincarnation process, she is also physically weak likely due to this. Despite being fated to live a short life, however, she seems to be doing just fine, and she's apparently been getting better overtime.&lt;ref&gt;[[Strange Creators of Outer World]] - [[Who's Who of Humans &amp; Youkai in Gensokyo]]: [[Strange Creators of Outer World/Who's Who of Humans &amp; Youkai in Gensokyo/Hieda no Akyuu|Hieda no Akyuu]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personality===
{{Stub|section}}

===Abilities===
;Not forgetting things seen once
As an incarnation of the [[Child of Miare]], Akyuu has the same photographic memory attributed to her ancestor Hieda no Are. Although less an innate ability and more a secret art, she also possesses a means of reincarnation. In a footnote in [[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Bunbunmaru_Newspaper|the Bunbunmaru newspaper article of her birth]], she states that only those memories related to the ''[[Gensokyo Chronicle]]'' are preserved between incarnations, and she states in her monologue that her memories from ancient times are very unclear. She does, however, retain even some memories of her distant ancestor Are.

It seems that her means of reincarnation requires several years of preparation in advance of her death, including bargaining with the [[Yama]] to perform work in the afterlife. The Children of Miare have short lifespans, seldom living beyond the age of thirty. As a result, Hieda does not get to spend much of her existence as an ordinary [[human]]. However, she has recently been able to befriend [[youkai]] that live long enough to meet her in multiple lives, so this doesn't seem to cause her much distress.

==Character Design==
===Name===
Her full name is {{nihongo|''Hieda no Akyuu''|稗田 阿求}}; note that it's romanised correctly with two u's.&lt;br /&gt;{{nihongo|"Hieda"|稗田}} means "millet field". The {{nihongo|"Miare"|御阿礼}} in "Child of Miare" presumably refers to {{nihongo|[[wikipedia:Hieda no Are|Hieda no Are]]|稗田 阿礼}}, the oral historian credited with helping compile the [[Wikipedia:Kojiki|Kojiki]], Japan's first written historical record. The (unwritten) [[wikipedia:Hiragana|hiragana]] character {{nihongo||の|no}} used here indicates a "belonging", thus the English equivalent of her name would be "Akyuu of the Hieda". In ancient Japan times, it was common for aristocrats with a clan's name to have ''no'' between their clan's name and first name.&lt;br /&gt;
The name {{nihongo|"Akyuu"|阿求}} has two points to note:&lt;br /&gt;
The former character {{nihongo|"a"|阿}} is a letter working as diminutive/pejorative. This hanzi was imported into Japan and borrowed limitedly to indicate a prefix "{{nihongo|o|お}}" as a variant of the similar prefix {{nihongo|o|御}} — only used before female name. So it should be now seen a suffix "-san" or "-chan".&lt;br /&gt;
The latter character {{nihongo|"kyuu"|求}} means "to seek/​request/​want" literally, but it should be seen as a pun on the Japanese word for {{nihongo|"nine"|九|kyuu}} since she is the ninth Child of Miare. [[ZUN]] romanised her name with only one u in the titles of ''[[Akyu's Untouched Score]]'', which is technically incorrect. As seen in the [[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Colophon|Colophon]] of ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'', the names of Akyuu's previous incarnations as Children of Miare (Aichi, Ani, Ami, Ayo, Ago, Amu, Anana and Aya) are all puns on numbers, with Are standing for {{nihongo|zero|零|rei}}.&lt;br /&gt;
Then put them together, her name is together "little girl in the ninth generation of Hieda clan".

In [[wikipedia:Yen Press|Yen Press]]'s English translation of ''[[Forbidden Scrollery]]'', her name is rendered "Akyu Hiedano".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=ZUN|author-link1=ZUN|first2=Moe|last2=Harukawa|author-link2=Moe Harukawa|translator-first1=Alethea|translator-last1=Nibley|translator-first2=Athena|translator-last2=Nibley|title=[[Forbidden Scrollery]]|volume=1|page=8|location=New York City, NY, USA|publisher=Yen Press|date=November 21, 2017|isbn=9780316511896|edition=trade paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=ZUN|author-link1=ZUN|first2=Moe|last2=Harukawa|author-link2=Moe Harukawa|translator-first1=Alethea|translator-last1=Nibley|translator-first2=Athena|translator-last2=Nibley|title=Forbidden Scrollery|volume=6|page=161|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rmaBDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT161&amp;lpg=PT161&amp;dq=Akyu+Hiedano&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=DN_wFvtxRs&amp;sig=ACfU3U33bP8JJbtcZKPNp-lRZXOYMnbj3w&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjmjZapp7nhAhXPm-AKHe4rDZoQ6AEwFHoECAYQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Akyu%20Hiedano&amp;f=false|location=New York City, NY, USA|publisher=Yen Press|date=February 19, 2019|isbn=9780316512091|edition=digital download|access-date=April 5, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Design===
Akyuu has purple hair, purple eyes and wears a light pink flower-shaped ornament in her hair, which matches the flowers on her sleeves. Her outfit resembles a "wa lolita" type or a Japanese-esque maid outfit. It has yellow flower-patterned sleeves, a green vest, and a shortened hakama skirt separated by a red, white laced obi. She uses glasses to read.

==Appearances==
[[File:FSAkyuu.jpg|thumb|right|120px|Akyuu as seen in [[Forbidden Scrollery]]]]
===Literature===
;''Perfect Memento in Strict Sense''
Akyuu wrote the in-universe book ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'' that shows articles of various characters from ''[[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]]'' to ''[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]''. In them, she shows actual facts about the characters, and sometimes shows speculation.

;''Memorizable Gensokyo''
In addition to being the in-universe author of ''Perfect Memento in Strict Sense'', Akyuu also appears in the side manga ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Memorizable Gensokyo|Memorizable Gensokyo]]''. Akyuu is first visited by [[Yukari Yakumo]], who seeks to read and edit the [[Gensokyo Chronicle]] before it is published. Later on, [[Reimu Hakurei]] and [[Marisa Kirisame]] stop by to see it as well.

;''Symposium of Post-mysticism''
Additionally, Akyuu wrote the in-universe book ''[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]]''. What was included was a symposium that Akyuu arranged, to which [[Marisa Kirisame]], [[Kanako Yasaka]], [[Byakuren Hijiri]], and [[Toyosatomimi no Miko]] attended. Akyuu recorded their discussions in the background, and sometimes made a few comments. She also showed articles of various characters from ''[[Mountain of Faith]]'' to ''[[Ten Desires]]'' and added newspapers from [[Bunbunmaru Newspaper]] and [[Kakashi Spirit News]] that [[Reimu Hakurei]] threw in at the end of the symposium.

;''Forbidden Scrollery''
Akyuu frequently appears in ''[[Forbidden Scrollery]]'', appearing older than her previous appearances. In Chapters 1 and 2, Akyuu appears to be taking interest in the rare [[demon books]] that the [[Suzunaan]] has in stock. In Chapter 6, she aids the people of the [[Human Village]] by planting a trap for [[Tupai|a supposed sake-drinking youkai]]. Starting in chapter 40, she begins writing murder mysteries under the pen name "Agatha Chris Q.", a play on [[wikipedia:Agatha Christie|Agatha Christie]] (author of the novel ''[[wikipedia:And Then There Were None|And Then There Were None]]'', from which the name "U.N. Owen" used on the title of [[Flandre Scarlet]]'s boss theme was taken) and her own name.

===Music CDs===
;''Akyu's Untouched Score''
Akyuu stars in the ''[[Akyu's Untouched Score]]'' series, which is a collection of tracks from the [[PC-98]] games. She makes comments on each CD, to which they show her taste for [[wikipedia:FM synthesis|FM synthesis]] music.

==Relationships==
===Keine Kamishirasawa===
[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Keine_Kamishirasawa|Keine's article in ''Perfect Memento in Strict Sense'']] states that [[Keine Kamishirasawa]] has a close relation with the Hieda family, and Keine uses their records for her lessons. It also reveals Akyuu is not a student at Keine's school. Keine's powers to erase and create history don't affect the Hieda Family's [[Gensokyo Chronicle]].

===Yukari Yakumo===
Akyuu and [[Yukari Yakumo]] "first met" in ''[[Memorizable Gensokyo]]'', though their mannerisms imply that they've known each other in Akyuu's previous lives (possibly as early as Hieda no Aichi 1,200 years ago). Akyuu looks up to Yukari, referring to her as "The Sage of the [[Youkai]]" with solemn awe and respect, and she readily allows Yukari to proofread and edit the latest edition of the Gensokyo Chronicle. However, Akyuu's written article on Yukari in ''Perfect Memento in Strict Sense'' shows she's aware one can't always trust Yukari's word, and that Yukari's logic isn't the same as a [[human]]'s.

===Reimu Hakurei===
The Hakurei clan and Hieda clan appear to have some relations, as the [[Hakurei Shrine]] volunteered to hold a party in 1994 when Hieda no Akyuu was born in [[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Bunbunmaru Newspaper|the Bunbunmaru newspaper article of her birth]]. It is unknown if [[Reimu Hakurei]] was present at or born before this time (the earliest known year in the ''[[Touhou Project]]'' that Reimu's been depicted was 2001 or 2002 in [[Curiosities of Lotus Asia/Chapter_22|''Curiosities of Lotus Asia'' Chapter 22]], but Reimu's age at that time isn't stated). Reimu's dialogue in ''[[Memorizable Gensokyo]]'' shows that she's been to the Hieda Residence before and is familiar with it, but has not met Akyuu in person prior to the events of that story.

===Kosuzu Motoori===
Due to their shared interest in books, Akyuu and [[Kosuzu Motoori]] appear to be close friends - Akyuu frequently visits [[Suzunaan]] to borrow books, and the two speak far more casually when in each others' company. Akyuu is aware that Kosuzu's continued dabbling in [[demon books]] could potentially turn her into a youkai, but does not actively try to stop her, only warning Kosuzu that becoming a youkai would make her life difficult.

==Additional Information==
*[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Bunbunmaru Newspaper|Aya's newspaper article]] on Akyuu's birth states, "With her, there are now nine generations of the Children of Miare (Girl of Are, Boy of Are)." It thus appears that one or more of Akyuu's previous incarnations were male.
*''[[Memorizable Gensokyo]]'' and ''[[Forbidden Scrollery]]'' show that Akyuu has several female [[human]] servants and a pet cat.
*Hieda no Aichi first started writing the Gensokyo Chronicles at age 18.
*A footnote in ''[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]]'' reveals that Akyuu is fond of [[Choujuu Gigaku]]'s music, implying that she's attended at least one of their concerts.
*Akyuu bears much resemblance to Akiko Isshiki from the manga "Kamakura Monogatari". ([https://onsen.touhouwiki.net/images/7/73/Akyuu_Akiko_Isshiki_comparison.png Comparison])

'''Hikariko''' is some kind of [[humanoid]] creature that's thought to be a [[fairy]] who attacks the heroines twice on stage 4 of ''[[Lotus Land Story]]'' and what appears to be the same character on stage 3 of ''[[Mystic Square]]''. In the former game, she appears in [[Mugenkan]] when [[Reimu Hakurei]] or [[Marisa Kirisame]] enter the mansion and attacks. She re-appears again later for a rematch, using the same techniques of [[danmaku]].

However, she re-appears in the latter game as soon as the heroine (including [[Mima]] ''and'' [[Yuuka Kazami]]) enters [[Makai]] and attacks them there. Once she's finished with firing her danmaku, she'll fade into the background and come back a second later directly above the player and shoot more bullets, but can only be defeated once. Since she's got no dialogue with the player on both games, nothing is known about her.

==Character Design==
===Name===
It may also be referred to as the {{nihongo|"LLS 4th Stage Midboss"|幻想郷四面中ボス}} or the {{nihongo|"MS 3rd Stage Midboss"|怪綺談三面中ボス}}. Japanese fans tend to call this character {{nihongo|"Child of Light"|光子|Hikariko}}.

===Design===
The sprite of her in ''Lotus Land Story'' shows that she has short purple hair, a yellow dress with a bow, green shoes, a big green bow on dress, and has very light transparent wings that ''might'' be attached to her arms. She has a pink hat with a long ribbon attached to it and has yellow sparkles around her. Her sprite in ''Mystic Square'' is just as same as ''Lotus Land Story'''s, but her hat with a long ribbon is now gone.

==Additional Information==
*The Western fanbase also sometimes refers to her as {{nihongo||蓮華的|Rengeteki}} (meaning "lotus flower -like"), and even the Japanese name 光子 is sometimes read alternatively as {{nihongo||光子|Koushi}} (meaning "photon"). The name 'Hikariko' sees the most consistent usage.

{{nihongo|'''Hina Kagiyama'''|鍵山　雛|Kagiyama Hina}} is a misfortune [[god]] and the leader of the Nagashi-bina doll army. Her job is to gather the misfortune of [[human]]s, as well as scare off lost [[human]]s who get too near to the [[Youkai Mountain]] at [[the Great Youkai Forest]].

==General Information==
Hina first appeared as the Stage 2 boss in ''[[Mountain of Faith]]'', but had no relation to the story of the game. She was later a target on stage 2 of ''[[Double Spoiler]]'' and was in the background of ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]''.

Hina is a misfortune god, but as they don't collect faith or have any shrines dedicated to them, they are more gods in name rather than nature.

===Personality===
Hina's personality is unclear, but according to those who have come in contact with her, she appears to be friendly and sociable.

===Abilities===
;Stockpiling misfortune
Hina possesses the ability to store and manage misfortune inside herself. By people's exorcism, she collects misfortune, and is able to stockpile it in her surroundings. Misfortune in her surroundings possesses power to give any kind of human or [[youkai]] misfortune, which causes misfortune to [[human]]s and [[youkai]] that come near her. However, this does not mean she stockpiles the misfortune in herself, and since it is always in the "surroundings" that she stockpiles the misfortune, she definitely does not become misfortune herself.

The misfortune that she takes up from [[human]]s is given over to other [[god]]s. She holds no ill will towards humans, however, and amasses misfortune merely as a way of preventing it from befalling others. The negative energy of misfortune is what gives Hina her power. As one that stores the misfortune, it can be said that from a certain point of view, she also possesses good fortune.

In order to amass this misfortune, she collects the Nagashi-bina dolls in which humans use to put their own misfortune and float downstream. Perhaps as a performance of her stockpiling of misfortune in [[danmaku]], her spinning may be a reference to her ability to store up curses. This is because the kanji for {{nihongo|"curse"|厄|yaku}} looks somewhat like a swirl, just like the one on her dress. It can be seen that something like misfortune flies in Hina's surroundings, developing into danmaku as a spiral. It seems like she throws them as bullets in the form of amulets. Additionally, a purple-blue-ish fog can be seen swarming around her when she casts a [[spell card]].

===Occupation===
In addition to scaring off humans from the [[Youkai Mountain]] and amassing misfortune, she has apparently begun selling the Nagashi-bina dolls that she collects as a form of recycling. However, as it is generally a taboo to pay any attention to a misfortune god, her stand is probably ignored.

==Character Design==
[[File:ThGKHina.png|thumb|right|200px|Hina, as illustrated in ''[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]]''.]]
Hina is a {{nihongo|misfortune goddess|厄神|yakujin}}. By utilizing the Japanese ritual {{nihongo||流し雛|[[Wikipedia:ja:流し雛|nagashi-bina]]}} – a custom which people transfer their {{nihongo|[[impurity]]|穢れ|kegare}} and {{nihongo|misfortune|厄|yaku}} on to a {{nihongo|hina doll|雛人形|hina ningyou}} and then putting it into a river to be carried away – she collects the misfortune by gathering the hina dolls at the downstream.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]]'': [[Symposium of Post-mysticism/Hina Kagiyama|Hina Kagiyama's article]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Name===
Her name is {{nihongo||鍵山雛|Hina Kagiyama}}. The characters for {{nihongo||鍵山|Kagiyama}} literally mean "key mountain". {{nihongo||雛|Hina}} usually means "(bird) chick", but in her case, it's highly likely that it came from the event of {{nihongo||流し'''雛'''|nagashi-bina}}.

===Design===
In ''[[Mountain of Faith]]'''s official art, Hina has aquamarine hair and eyes. Her hair is decorated with red bows and white frills. Part of her hair is tied under her chin with a bow as a sort front ponytail. She wears a red dress which is darker around her middle and lighter on the bottom. The dress also has white frills on the bottom and an enormous white kerchief on top. The bottom of her dress is decorated with a similar aquamarine swirl resembling the "{{lang|ja|厄}}" (misfortune) kanji at the bottom. As footwear she has knee-length black cross-laced boots similar to [[Alice Margatroid]]'s.

At the fight Hina is spinning during all her [[spell card]] attacks. And apparently it is her speciality, as explained in ''[[The Grimoire of Marisa]]''. This is also seen in ''[[Double Spoiler]]''.

==Appearances==
;''Mountain of Faith''
[[File:Th10HinaSprite.png|frame|Hina's sprite in ''MoF'']]
Depending on who you choose as a playable character, Hina will either face [[Reimu Hakurei]] or [[Marisa Kirisame]] in the stage 2 fight of ''Mountain of Faith'' at [[Youkai Mountain#The Great Youkai Forest|the Great Youkai Forest]] near a river.
:{{Main|Mountain of Faith/Story/Reimu's Scenario#Stage 2|l1=Reimu Arc}}
Hina tries to chase Reimu away during the midboss fight, as she explains that it's her job to chase away lost humans. But Reimu claims she isn't lost and just want to go to the [[Youkai Mountain]] and then starts to fight as she thinks Hina is a [[youkai]]. Hina once again tries to stop Reimu, but fails.
:{{Main|Mountain of Faith/Story/Marisa's Scenario#Stage 2|l1=Marisa Arc}}
Marisa says it takes so long to enter the mountain that she could "recite all the digits of pi" before she gets there. Hina then enters and is wondering what Marisa is talking about. Hina does not want Marisa, or any other human, to enter the mountain as it could be dangerous. Hina is trying to protect them from the mountain, but Marisa wants to enter the mountain anyway and starts fighting with Hina.

===Spin-offs===
;''Double Spoiler''
In ''[[Double Spoiler]]'', Hina appeared as a [[stage]] 2 target, where she uses a few [[spell card]]s and had [[Aya Shameimaru]] and [[Hatate Himekaidou]] take photos of her and her [[danmaku]].

;''Hopeless Masquerade''
[[File:Th135Hina.png|frame|Hina in ''HM'']]
Hina made a background cameo appearance in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'' on the [[Genbu Ravine]] and [[Youkai Tanuki Forest]] stage. She is seen standing waving her hand.
===Print works===
;''[[Foul Detective Satori]]''
She briefly appears at the end of chapter 18, where she discovers a printed circuit board in the river, wondering where such an item could've come from.

{{nihongo|'''Hisoutensoku'''|非想天則}} was an unknown huge object seen roaming around the [[Misty Lake]] in the events of [[Touhou Hisoutensoku|the game of the same name]]. It was spotted by numbers of characters before it mysteriously vanished, being mistaken variously for a [[wikipedia:Brocken spectre|Brocken spectre]], a [[Wikipedia:Giant robot (science fiction)|giant robot]], a [[Daidarabotchi]], and [[Taisui Xingjun]]. In fact, Hisoutensoku was a nuclear reactor-powered attraction created by the [[kappa]] to advertise their upcoming {{nihongo|"Future Water Youkai Bazaar"|未来水妖バザー|mirai suiyou bazaa}}.

==Character Design==
===Origin===
The design of Hisoutensoku resembles that of [[Wikipedia:Gakutensoku|Gakutensoku]] ({{lang|ja|学天則}} "learning from natural law") at many points: Both of them are big, robotic humanoids, are made for a happy purpose, move pneumatically (the former by compressed air, the latter by steam), appear to be smiling, and grip something in their hands. The last point of similarity might be especially important.

Gakutensoku held Reikantou ({{lang|ja|霊感灯}}, "Light of Inspiration") in his left hand and a quill resembling a [[Wikipedia:Signal arrow|kabura ya]] in his right hand. Hisoutensoku holds a [[Wikipedia:Morning star (weapon)|morning star]] similar to Reikantou. This tells us that Gakutensoku uses a weapon effectively or thinks through writing, while Hisoutensoku only grasps it for ornamentation or never thinks through it. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sci-museum.jp/server_sci/promot/press_p.html|title=東洋初のロボット「学天則(がくてんそく)」の復元作業が終了  ー4月24日（木）に報道関係者向け内見会を行いますー|language=ja|accessdate=2011-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:HisouTensokuGiant.png|frame|left|Hisoutensoku's shadow on the title screen of [[Touhou Hisoutensoku]].]]

===Design===
Seen in ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]'' endings, Hisoutensoku is a giant [[Robot|robotic]]-looking humanoid covered in gold with a red chest and pointed red wings. It has blue eyes (pink on the cover of ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku OST|Touhou Hisoutensoku ORIGINAL SOUND TRACK]]''), spikes emerging from the sides of its head, and a spherical "hat" with slightly-curved lines going around it. It holds a [[Wikipedia:Morning star (weapon)|morning star]] and its facial expression never changes.

==Story==
;Touhou Hisoutensoku
:{{main|Touhou Hisoutensoku/Story|l1=Touhou Hisoutensoku Story}}
Excitedly floating along the banks of the Misty Lake, the ice fairy [[Cirno]] believes it to be a mythical giant [[youkai]] called a [[Daidarabotchi]]. If that's true, Cirno thinks, and if she can "tame" it, then she won't ever have to fear anything again.

The [[shrine maiden]] [[Sanae Kochiya]] isn't sure what to think of the giant shape she sees moving in the distance. The best she can come up with is that it might be a giant robot, like those she's seen in anime or manga, and sets off towards the lake to investigate.

[[Hong Meiling]], Chief of Security and Gatekeeper of the [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]], sees the giant shape from the roof of the manor and anxiously wonders if the tales she'd heard about a God of Cataclysm from the [[Wikipedia:Mainland China|mainland]], "[[Taisui Xingjun]]", might be coming true. Meiling realizes that if it is indeed Taisui Xingjun, then [[Gensokyo]] will soon be attacked by countless minions of the wrathful deity, bringing with them all manner of catastrophes and natural disasters. Determined to spread the alarm, Meiling rushes into the [[:File:SDM-LibraryNight.jpg|library]] to warn Lady [[Patchouli Knowledge|Patchouli]].

==Additional Information==
*Some of the symbols written on Gakutensoku's pedestal coincide with some Touhou characters: The sun is at the center, which indicates a [[Wikipedia:Yatagarasu|yatagarasu]] as the core, and a frog and snake are on the right side on it. The yatagarasu probably originally pointed to Tennou, and the frog and snake were there as typical animals. From the Touhou perspective, however, the setting of Hisoutensoku takes it to mean that Utsuho activates it and Suwako and Kanako empower her.
*Hisoutensoku is one of the few characters in the entire series to have appeared in a game without ever having been a playable character or a boss character, presumably due to Hisoutensoku not having an independent mind (being an advertisement attraction) or its immense size.
*Hisoutensoku is similar in appearance to [[wikipedia:Mazinger Z|Mazinger Z]] (the first "[[wikipedia:Super Robot|Super Robot]]"), particularly while the latter is equipped with its "Scrander" wings. [[Touhou_Hisoutensoku/Music#Notes|Some of the songs in its game are also named in the style of old-school Super Robot anime]].
*The title of the ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku OST]]'', {{nihongo|"Thermonuclear Titan Hisoutensoku"|核熱造神ヒソウテンソク|Kakunetsuzoushin Hisoutensoku}}, spells Hisoutensoku's name in katakana rather than kanji. This spelling is also seen on concept art included with the CD.

}}
{{nihongo|'''Hong Meiling'''|紅 美鈴|Hon Meirin}} is a [[youkai]], though it isn't currently known which specific category she actually belongs to. She's the [[gatekeeper]] of the [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]]. She is known for her mastery of the martial arts, part of which can be seen in her movement which is based on Bajiquan, such as Shin-Kyaku and Tetsuzanko.

==General Information==
Meiling first appeared as the [[Stage]] 3 [[boss]] and midboss of ''[[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]]''. Later she became a playable character in ''[[Immaterial and Missing Power]]'', one of Stage 5's targets in ''[[Shoot the Bullet]]'', and one of the three protagonists of ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]''.

Meiling is a proud Chinese-style martial arts master and a [[youkai]].

===Personality===
Meiling is very laid-back, which sometimes gets her into trouble, and is known to sleep on the job.(Although she does her job when needed.) She regularly receives challengers and is a worthy opponent of the strong. She is not outwardly aggressive towards humans, except those who attempt to trespass on the grounds of [[Scarlet Devil Mansion|Scarlet Devil Manor]], though it seems the only humans who trespass are powerful enough to defeat her in the first place. She will also sometimes have conversations with bypassers. 

Many of her lines in ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]'' express a boastful, somewhat stereotypical patriotism for China: "You're all not there yet! You're all children compared to 4000 years of history!" She also compares [[Yuyuko Saigyouji]] to a [[Jiang Shi]] and notes that [[Tenshi Hinanawi]] and the [[Celestial]]s have read Chinese classics. The script also reveals that she seems to spend a lot of time reading manga written by the [[tengu]].

===Ability===
Meiling's mastery of t'ai chi ch'uan is her main ability in combat, but other than that, she has no youkai-like ability. While not particularly strong as a youkai, she is described as being well-rounded, with no particular weak point when fighting [[human]]s; this is likely why she was hired to watch the gate of the Scarlet Devil Mansion. 

;Usage of ''Qi''
Meiling is able to manipulate her life-breath, or ''qi''. Her danmaku and her flight likely involve projecting her ''qi'' outward to attack foes or propel herself in a manner seen in martial arts folklore and in contemporary Japanese manga.

===Occupation===
Meiling works as the [[gatekeeper]] and gardener of the [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]]. She also acts as the doorkeeper when there's a party at the mansion. She performs Tai Chi Chuan daily, and has a nap at noon.

==Character Design==
[[File:PMiSS meiling.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Meiling's depiction in [[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]]]
===Name===
Her full name is {{nihongo|'''Hong Meiling'''|紅 美鈴|Hon Meirin}}. The character for {{nihongo||紅|Hong}} literally means "Scarlet/Crimson" in Japanese and "Red" in Chinese. {{nihongo||美鈴|Meiling}} means "Beauty Bell/Chime". The latter part of her name, Meiling, is at least a common Chinese name. Her full name is a referrence to Hong Mei, a tai chi grandmaster. These characters can be read in Japanese as "Kurenai Misuzu", and you'll sometimes see her name mispronounced or miswritten that way. Using English name order, her name would actually be "Meiling Hong", which is used normally by Chinese diaspora or immigrants into Western countries. Some sources and media may often read Chinese names in Japanese on'yomi, rendering her name as "Kou Birei/Kou Mirin". Meiling's name is often rendered in pinyin/Mandarin instead.

{{nihongo||紅|Hong}} is "kou" in the on reading, "Hóng" in standard Chinese and "Hhong" in Shanghainese. It could possibly refer to the [[Wikipedia:Red Guards (China)|Red Guards]] ({{lang|zh-hk|紅衛兵}}, [[wikipedia:Pinyin|Pinyin]]: ''Hóng Wèibīng''), a youth movement of the cultural revolution of [[Wikipedia:China|China]]. This is reinforced by her clothing. The word "guard" also has the meaning of "gatekeeper" as well. Thus, it could indicate a pun, where "guard of the family name Hong = Red Guard." "Hong" also appears in the title of ''[[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]]'' ({{lang|ja|東方'''紅'''魔郷}}). However, the name of the game in its developmental stages was {{lang|ja|東方'''紅'''茶館}}, thus indicating that it has a strong relation to the {{lang|ja|紅}} of {{nihongo|black tea|紅茶}}.

Additionally, her first name could also stand for {{lang|ja|虹}}, which means rainbow, since it has the same ''on'' reading as {{lang|ja|紅}} as well as the same pronunciation in standard Chinese and Shanghaiese. However, it also is synonymous with a two-headed dragon-like creature in a Chinese-context, thus the ''hóng'' dragon's rainbow associations may be reflected in Meiling's title of "Colorful Rainbow Gatekeeper", the naming theme of some of her spell cards, and her bullet patterns and attacks being usually rainbow-colored.

Her name was spelled by [[ZUN]] as in ''[[Immaterial and Missing Power]]'' and the corrected version of [http://www.comptiq.com/release/comic/55touhou_owabi.html Sangetsusei] as ''Hong Meirin''. Her name became ''Hoan Meirin'' in ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]''. Though in pinyin, it would be "Meiling"; there is not a single source within the ''[[Touhou Project]]'' itself that states that it is spelled in this manner. Additionally, Meiling says "Geez, please remember my name~" in a win quote in ''Immaterial and Missing Power'' while ZUN didn't know how to answer the question "Is Chuugoku's name forgotten?"&lt;ref name="MUtDoT"&gt;[[Meiji University talkshow "Dawn of Touhou"]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Design===
Meiling has aqua-blue eyes and long, scarlet hair that symbolizes both her name and the place that she's guarding. Her green beret and dress resemble traditional Chinese clothing mixed with the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Guards_(China) red guard] uniform. Her beret has a gold star on the front with the Traditional Chinese character "{{lang|ja|龍}}" that is read and pronounced as "lóng" in standard Chinese and means dragon. She wears white pants in her fighting game sprites.
==Appearances==
===Games===
;''Embodiment of Scarlet Devil''
[[File:Th06HongSprite.png|frame|Meiling's sprite in ''EoSD'']]
During the events of ''[[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]]'', she bravely fought against the intruding heroines, but ultimately failed. She ends up being followed by the player character to the mansion against her will, initiating another fight.

===Spin-offs===
;''Immaterial and Missing Power''
:{{Main|Immaterial and Missing Power/Story/Meiling's Script|l1=Immaterial and Missing Power Meiling's Script}}
Meiling was made playable in ''[[Immaterial and Missing Power]]'' through a downloadable patch, but only in the versus mode; there is no main story campaign for her. 
;''Shoot the Bullet''
[[File:Th095HongSprite.png|frame|Meiling's sprite in ''StB'']]
In ''[[Shoot the Bullet]]'', [[Aya Shameimaru]] encountered Meiling on [[stage]] 5 and took photos of her [[danmaku]].

;''Touhou Hisoutensoku''
:{{Main|Touhou Hisoutensoku/Translation/Meiling's Scenario|l1=Touhou Hisoutensoku Meiling's Scenario}}
In ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]'', she saw a roaming giant that she was certain was an incarnation of a God of Calamity, "[[Taisui Xingjun]]". However, those she warned didn't realize the seriousness of the situation they were facing. Thus it was up to Meiling alone to defend the Scarlet Devil Mansion and all of [[Gensokyo]] from this destructive deity. After defeating some pseudo-characters sent as [[assassin]]s, she defeats a [[Giant Catfish]] and faces Taisui himself, then realizing it was all a dream.

;''Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red''
:{{Main|Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red/Meiling|l1=Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red Article and Interview: Meiling}}''
One day, a mysterious crop circle appears in the gardens of the [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]], causing widespread speculation, rumors and gossip around the Mansion.

Meiling, who is responsible for taking care of the garden, claims not to be the culprit, but admits that she's been tasked by Remilia to restore the garden to its original state now that her mistress has become bored with the crop circle pattern.
During her interview with [[Aya Shameimaru]], she notes she is quite worried, as she has no idea how to change the flowers back.
Questioned about the crop circle's origins, Meiling vehemently denies falling asleep, so Aya goes on to talk about aliens...

The culprit revealed at the end is [[Patchouli Knowledge]].

;''Touhou Bougetsushou''
During the party to celebrate the completion of Remilia's Moon rocket in ''[[Silent Sinner in Blue]]'', Meiling was briefly shown guarding the gates of the [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]] as invitees walked by. 

;''Wild and Horned Hermit''
In Chapter 16 of ''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'', it appears that because [[Remilia Scarlet]] and [[Sakuya Izayoi]] were both drinking from the [[Ibaraki Box of a Hundred Medicines]] at a flower viewing, they started to tease Meiling. 

;''Cheating Detective Satori''
In the first incident of ''[[Cheating Detective Satori]]'', [[Patchouli Knowledge]] is revealed to have been non-fatally poisoned by an unknown person, leading to an investigation at the [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]] of who the culprit could be. Early on into the investigation, Meiling is shown standing at the gates of the [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]]. She is approached by [[Rin Kaenbyou]], who is presumably there to ask Meiling about the incident. She first asks Meiling if there were any visitors at the time of Patchouli's poisoning, to which Meiling tells her there were none. Smiling, Rin then asks Meiling if she was even watching the gate at the time, to which Meiling hesitantly responds that she was. However, Rin tells Meiling what others have told her, which is that the gate to the Scarlet Devil Mansion is usually wide open while the gatekeeper is notoriously absent. Meiling appears quite nervous at this point, even more so when Rin mentions that the detective ([[Satori Komeiji]]) can read minds, so Meiling had "better just be honest" about whether or not she was watching the gate, as it will come to light at one point or another. Flustered and feeling the pressure, Meiling cracks and tells Rin that she was asleep at the time that Patchouli was poisoned.

Later on in the incident, [[Sakuya Izayoi]] is accused of being the culprit of Patchouli's poisoning, and thus is locked away in the basement. Meiling visits Sakuya to bring her food and scorn her due to the amount of evidence pointing to her being the culprit. She slams and locks the basement door on Sakuya before leaving her there alone with [[Flandre Scarlet]].

Sometime later in this same incident, [[Reimu Hakurei]] is flying overhead when she spots Meiling passed out on the ground. Reimu lands and approaches Meiling, who attempts to slap Meiling awake, however this does not work. Rin then approaches Reimu and the passed out Meiling on the ground. Rin briefly inspects Meiling before concluding that the symptoms Meiling is feeling are the same as Patchouli's symptoms, meaning that Meiling has also been poisoned by the unknown culprit.

At the end of the first incident, it is revealed that both Patchouli and Meiling were not poisoned, but rather they were possessed by a criminal from [[Former Hell]]. Said criminal is a [[vengeful spirit]] with the ability control the body of whom they possess, as well as devour the magical energy of those they possess. The criminal first possessed Sakuya, who used Sakuya's body to move closer on Patchouli. The spirit then hopped onto Meiling, who sapped her energy and put her into a coma.

==Relationships==
Meiling has at least communicated to the entire cast of ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]'' and may be on friendly terms with anyone who walks nearby the gates of the [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]].

===Residents of the Scarlet Devil Mansion===
;[[Remilia Scarlet]]
Remilia is Meiling's mistress. Being the type of person Remilia is, she tends to tease all her subordinates, and Meiling is no exception. She does get mad at her sometimes if things don't go her way, but the two are generally on friendly terms, and in ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]'' it's suggested that Remilia reads some of the same manga Meiling does.
;[[Sakuya Izayoi]]
Sakuya is a fellow employee of Meiling. Meiling's win quote against [[Sakuya Izayoi]] in ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]'' implies a friendly, if somewhat formal, relationship between the two of them. In those quotes, Meiling also tells Sakuya that she always goes easy on her, so it seems they do spar often. She also claims that she wouldn't go easy on the maid if it were a formal match, but it's unknown how much effort there is on Sakuya's part, or if Meiling's claims about her strength are true at all. Sakuya is also shown to care for Meiling, though is strict about her not slacking off.
;[[Patchouli Knowledge]]
Patchouli is the friend of her mistress, and sometimes berates her for not thinking enough and spending too much time reading senseless comics.
;Fairy maids and other staff
The [[fairy maid]]s assist Meiling in ''[[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]]'', but it's unknown what sort of authority she has over the [[fairy maid]]s in the mansion. ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'' imples that youkai also join in Meiling's battles on a whim, but instead usually only point and laugh.
;[[Flandre Scarlet]]
Flandre is Remilia's younger sister. It's unknown what kind of relationship Meiling and Flandre have, however.

===Minor Relationships===
;Taisui Xingjun and the giant catfish
[[Taisui Xingjun]] is Meiling's sworn enemy and the [[Giant Catfish]] is the avatar of Taisui Xingjun. They both only appeared in her dream while she was reading a manga, so any realistic communications with them is so far not shown.

==Additional Information==
*If Meiling loses to [[Youmu]] in ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]'', Youmu will ask if Meiling shouldn't just use a weapon, namely a green dragon blade. This can be a source of confusion, since many would imagine the legendary [[wikipedia:Green Dragon Crescent Blade|Green Dragon Crescent Blade]] wielded by the famous Chinese general Guan Yu, but women seldom use pole arms in Chinese martial arts. In Japan, the term has become a common misnomer for the [[wikipedia:Liuyedao|liuyedao]] and other [[wikipedia:Dao (sword)|Chinese sabers]]. As Youmu admits she has only heard about them in stories, the use of her local, incorrect term is likely intentional.
*One of her normal bullet attacks (along with a few of her skill cards) in ''Touhou Hisoutensoku'' resembles Krizalid's Typhoon/Tuhon Rage from ''The King of Fighters '99'', ''2000'', and ''2002: Unlimited Match''. 
*Meiling looks very similar to [[Orange]].
*Meiling is one of the few characters to not make a cameo appearance in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]''. The reason is currently unknown.
*Meiling's Movement in ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]'' is based on Bajiquan, a Chinese-martial art, that is popular in fighting games because its routine was practiced by moving in a nearly straight line. Which makes it easier to be translated into a fighting game.
**Meiling's Idle Stance on that game is Liang Yi Zhuang. The well-known fighting stance of that martial art.
*Meiling's spell card [https://youtu.be/-cHp0f7UpGo?t=90 Fiery Attack "Roc-Killing Fist] resembles [https://youtu.be/BH7k5OryqlI?t=122 Yun's First Super Art] from [[w:Street Fighter III: 2nd Impact|Street Fighter III: 2nd Impact]]
*Meiling does [[w:Gongfu tea ceremony|Gongfu tea ceremony]] in chapter 4 of [[Cheating Detective Satori]]. It is a traditional way of serving tea and involves ritual preparation and presentation of tea.
*Shibata Masahiro's manga series "[https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/manga.php?id=1648 Sarai]" seems to be a big inspiration for many of the characters from EoSD . Sarai is a manga about superpowered maids fighting youkai and monsters in a dystopian future. The series was published from 1997 to 2007 in Japan only.
** The main character of Sarai, [https://onsen.touhouwiki.net/wiki/File:Patchouli_Seal_%26_Sarai.jpeg Kannagi Sarai] (神薙サライ) is a red haired maid, and is possibly the inspiration of for Hong Meiling. As EoSD is a game that uses a red motif, from the name Scarlet to Meiling's last name, Hong, also meaning red/scarlet in Chinese/Japanese this character likely influences the whole motif of EoSD.

'''Hong Meiling'''

The always noisy Scarlet Devil Mansion. That day, it was as noisy as ever. Its gate guard had reported something to the mansion's master, Remilia Scarlet, but the master had loftily ignored her.

The girl felt a vague sense of uneasiness. That morning, she had seen a giant figure. Then, it dissolved into a lukewarm mist and disappeared.

Just what was that? A big shadow like a roc, and a sinister mist being produced. She was certain.

It was the shadow of the Buddha of Misfortune, "[[Taisui Xingjun]]".


She reported to the master of the mansion that an evil god that all youkai must join forces and fight against had finally appeared in Gensokyo.

Naturally, nobody listened to her.

The girl thought. In order to break up the everyday boredom with a little fun, she had intentionally exaggerated a bit.

She's the character born from such extreme contrarianism.&lt;br/&gt;
During that time, her name was so hard to pronounce so people gave her the lovely nickname "China" and people loved it. Nowadays, pretty much everyone knows how to pronounce her actual name, at least I hope so. She's a versatile character that can fill both a cool and a dumb role.

'''Hourai''' ({{lang|ja|蓬莱}}) is one of [[Alice Margatroid|Alice]]'s dolls. She's theoretically more powerful than Shanghai due to Shanghai being used by Alice while playing on the hard difficulty setting of ''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]'' and Hourai being used while playing on lunatic. Hourai appears in Alice's spell card [[Perfect Cherry Blossom/Spell Cards/Stage 3#Spell_Card_044|''Curse "Hanged Hourai Dolls"'']]. In ''[[Immaterial and Missing Power]]'' Hourai was one of Alice's 2nd level spell cards. She had the exact same sprite and effect as Shanghai (the 1st level spell card of the same type), only much stronger.

==Concept==
===Name===
[[Wikipedia:Mount Penglai|Mount Hourai]] (Penglai in Chinese, Fungloi in Cantonese) is a legendary island paradise in East Asian folklore, which was said to be inhabited by immortals who had special powers, and possessed rare treasures as well as the elixir of immortality.

===Appearance===
In ''[[Immaterial and Missing Power]]'''s official art, Hourai wears a long dark purple dress with a white apron and white sleeves, and matching dark purple shoes. There is a large red bow in her hair and a smaller matching bow around her neck. Her eyes aren't seen and her neck is hanged by a rope.

==Story==

===Relationships===

==Additional Information==
===Trivia===
*She so far has no known relation to either the [[Hourai Elixir]] or [[Kaguya Houraisan]], nor even to [[Fujiwara no Mokou]], who also has a spellcard called "Hourai Doll". It is most likely a reference to the aforementioned island paradise of Hourai, since Alice's other spell cards (such as Foggy London Dolls or Red-haired Dutch Dolls) are references to countries or cities.
*As with [[Shanghai]], Hourai is canonically a class of doll rather than a name for one individual doll, and multiple Hourai dolls are seen during its spell card in ''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]''.

{{nihongo|'''Ibaraki-Douji's Arm'''|茨木童子の腕|Ibaraki-Douji no Ude}} is [[Kasen Ibaraki|Kasen Ibaraki's]] formerly severed arm. She constitutes the [[oni]] essence of Kasen as well as the malevolent aspect of her personality, allowing for Kasen to return to her true form after fusing with her.

==General Information==

===Abilities===
;Super Strength
As an oni, Ibaraki-Douji's Arm possesses incredible strength, able to break the entire floor and making it explode with a single punch, generating a shockwave strong enough to send [[Reimu]] flying. She relies on sheer brute force. Reimu notes that there is no beauty in her attacks. Despite only using her right arm to do all the fighting, her strength is more than enough for Reimu to call her ridiculously powerful.

;Control Undead
Ibaraki-Douji's Arm is capable of animating and controlling the skeletons of people she's eaten to do her bidding. The skeletons are able to reform themselves even after being blown away by [[Reimu]]. It's unstated if this is an ability inherent to her or some sort of magic spell. She also summoned a huge pile of skulls by throwing a single one of them into the air; the combined weight of the pile of skulls was great enough to break the ground by crashing into it.

;Others
She uses stone pillars to attack Reimu from afar and disrupt her barrage of [[ofuda]]. She seemingly gathers them from the ground while floating, and without touching them, but the actual means are unknown.

===Personality===
Kasen's malevolence was contained in her arm before it was severed from her, eventually becoming its own entity. As her title suggests, Ibaraki-Douji's Arm appears to be purely evil. She had every intent to kill and eat Reimu, even implying that she'd use her reanimated skeleton as a servant. In the same instance, she claims a mound of inumerous skulls as all of her past victims that she's eaten, and Kasen reflects that even as just a severed arm she continued eating people.

==Background Information==
Ibaraki-Douji's Arm is, in fact, the formerly missing right arm of [[Kasen Ibaraki]], sealed off from Kasen with the youkai blade Oni-Cutter after containing Kasen's malevolence. Reimu found the cursed box containing the arm near the shed of her shrine. After picking it up, she was transported to [[Hell]], where the disembodied arm planned to attack and kill her.

===Name===
Her namesake is derived from the legendary oni, ''Ibaraki-douji'', one of the members of the [[Big Four of the Mountain|Four Heavenly Kings]]. Kasen Ibaraki is, indeed, one in the same with Ibaraki-douji. 

===Design===
This character looks almost exactly like Kasen, with nigh-identical clothes. Differences include her visible horns, her right arm being fully visible with a matching shackle and chain and the pressence of steel balls connected to both her legs with chains. She also seems to have more feral expressions compared to Kasen and shows bestial characteristics such as sharper-looking hair, slit pupils, long nails exclusively on her right hand and a noticeable fang when smirking. Of note is that her tabard and skirt is not magenta and green, but two shades of navy blue instead.

==Story==
;''Wild and Horned Hermit''
In Chapter 47, [[Reimu]] fell into a death-like state as a result of picking up a box in or near her shrine's shed labeled "Oni's Arm". Picking up the box transpoted her to [[Hell]]. In Chapter 49 Part 1, Ibaraki-Douji's Arm revealed herself and began to attack Reimu, constantly taunting her with threats of death and of being eaten. In Part 2 of the chapter, the arm buried Reimu in an avalanche of skulls, intending to finish her off. However, she was then distracted by [[Kasen]].

Kasen revealed that she deliberately placed her arm near the shrine so that Reimu could pick it up and get trapped in Hell. Her arm, delighted to see her, then accepted Kasen's proposal to reunite, create Kasen's true form.  However, this was a front, as Kasen actually wished that her malevolence and her arm remain sealed away, going as far as hiding a fragment of the original Oni-Cutter blade in some dumpling wrappings given to Reimu so Reimu could do the deed. Upon realizing this, Ibaraki's Arm forcefully took control of Kasen's entire body to fight Reimu, but Reimu managed to successfully sever off and seal her again.

Kasen currently keeps the arm physically near by in mummified-arm form as a trophy of sorts as well as a reminder, comparing it to being able to see your own death close by.

==Relationships==
===Kasen Ibaraki===
Ibaraki-Douji's Arm is Kasen Ibaraki's severed right arm. She actually contains all of Kasen's malevolence, forced into Kasen's arm before the arm was cut off with a youkai blade. As revealed in Chapter 49 Part 2 of ''Wild and Horned Hermit'', she appears to be in great terms with her. Kasen refers to her arm as her "partner" and uses the dignified pronoun "waga" for her. They both acted as if re-fusing was something they've wanted to do for a long time. However, this was a front, as Kasen actually wished that her malevolence and her arm remain sealed away. Upon realizing this, Ibaraki-Douji's Arm forcefully took control of Kasen's entire body before Reimu managed to cut off and seal her again. Kasen currently keeps the arm physically near by in mummified-arm form as a trophy of sorts as well as a reminder, comparing it to being able to see your own death close by.

===Reimu Hakurei===
Ibaraki-Douji's Arm seemed intent to kill and eat Reimu. Reimu, on the other hand, seemed intent to exterminate her, exclaiming that she hates oni. Things became significantly murkier when Kasen and her arm merged together. Hesitant to fight her former friend, Reimu initially couldn't bring herself to fight the arm at full strength. Upon realizing that Kasen herself was a distinct separate being from the arm and still on Reimu's side, however, she was able to fight with renewed determination and seal it off.

{{nihongo|'''Ichirin Kumoi'''|雲居 一輪|Kumoi Ichirin}} is a former [[human]] turned [[nyuudou]] user that the heroine encounters on their arrival at the [[Palanquin Ship]]. Along with [[Unzan]], she guards the Palanquin Ship of her own accord in order to assist in the revival of [[Byakuren Hijiri]]. 

==General Information==
Ichirin, along with [[Unzan]], first appeared as the Third stage boss of ''[[Undefined Fantastic Object]]'' and later as a playable character in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'' and ''[[Urban Legend in Limbo]]''. As part of a team with Unzan, they work together to face their challenges.

===Personality===
Ichirin is described as having a pleasant personality, but can also be tenacious at times.

===Abilities===
;Using nyuudou
Since [[Unzan]] is a [[nyuudou]], she's got the ability to manipulate her partner Unzan, mainly to perform attacks. In spell cards, the danmaku are all shot by Unzan, with Ichirin controlling, although there was one spell card Lightning "Electrified Nyuudou" where she did shoot danmaku herself. On the other hand, the non-spell cards are entirely shot by Ichirin who, strangely among the ''[[Touhou Project]]'' characters, doesn't use danmaku in the shape of bullets at all, shooting only lasers and long-shaped danmaku.

===Occupation===
As a member of the [[Myouren Temple]], Ichirin lives there and trains as a priest. Because of Unzan's physical strength, the two of them are tasked with doing physical labor, especially in high places.

==Backstory==
Her [[Symposium of Post-mysticism/Ichirin Kumoi &amp; Unzan|Symposium of Post-mysticism article]] gives her the following backstory:

Ichirin used to be human. Having heard of a man-eating foreseeing nyuudou, she dauntlessly went to encounter him and give him a scare. When she finally saw what looked like the feet of a monk, taking care not to raise her head, she shouted "The foreseeing nyuudou was foreseen!", a repelling spell.&lt;ref name="nyuudou"&gt;Foreseeing nyuudou are youkai monks who only show their feet at first. When their victim would look up to see their face, they would grow larger so that their heads would remain out of sight. It's been said that when the victim looks straight up, their head would get chopped off.&lt;/ref&gt; While that would normally be enough to make a nyuudou disappear, the sheer shock of his utter defeat and resulting admiration for the courageous girl prompted Unzan to devote the rest of his life to protecting her.

After this, Ichirin's life completely changed - she no longer felt any fear towards youkai, and was hated by humans at times. After going though a tempestuous life, before she knew it, she had become a youkai.

By the time of ''Undefined Fantastic Object'', Ichirin and Unzan have both joined [[Byakuren Hijiri]] due to her acceptance of youkai as well as her understanding of the human heart.

==Character Design==
[[File:ThGKIchirin.png|thumb|192px|Ichirin and [[Unzan]] as illustrated in ''[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]]''.]]
===Origin===
Ichirin's inspiration may come from the second volume of [[Wikipedia:Shigisan-engi|Shigi san Engi]]. In the story, [[Wikipedia:Emperor Daigo|Daigo Tennou]] becomes dangerously ill one day, so his subjects visited Myouren after hearing of his miracles to beg him to come and pray for the emperor's health. Myouren rejected their request, but proposed that he would pray at his temple and he would inform them when he finished. After approximately three days passed, [http://watashinouta.at.webry.info/200810/article_12.html Ken no Gohou] ({{lang|ja|剣の護法}}), a flying messenger of [[Bishamonten]], appeared near the court, who implied the end of Myouren's praying. After that, the emperor recovered very soon. This messenger had a sword in one hand, numerous blades around his neck, and he flew on the wheel very similar to a [[wikipedia:Dharmacakra|dharmacakra]], followed by wind or clouds.

Another possible source of inspiration for the Ichirin and Unzan character is an [http://www.obakemono.com/obake/tsukumogami/ old Japanese tale] about [[tsukumogami]] (youkai born from an old object attaining a spirit of its own after being around for 100 years). This story features a tsukumogami born from a Buddhist rosary called Ichiren Nyuudou.

===Name===
{{nihongo|''Ichirin Kumoi''|雲居 一輪}} is her full name. The characters for {{nihongo|''Kumoi''|雲居}} mean "Residence in the Clouds". The characters for {{nihongo|''Ichirin''|一輪}} mean "One Wheel". This name would indicate two directions. First, it is possible that Ichirin's name is partly inspired from the aforementioned Dharmacakra: It is called {{nihongo|"Hourin"|法輪}} in Japanese, a noun which shares one kanji with Ichirin's name. Second, "ichi-rin" is a unit of counting flowers, e.g. "ichi-rin no bara" (single rose); her and Unzan's title also includes the word relating to flower {{nihongo|"tairin"|大輪}}, which means "the bigness of flower" or "big flower".

===Design===
Ichirin has light purple wavy hair and dark purple eyes. She carries a medium-sized yellow ring in her right hand. On her head, she wears a headdress similar to a Hijab or a nun's headdress. She wears a white dress with a blue trim at the bottom and wears black shoes. Her outfit closely resembles that of a Buddhist nun's, which was a component [[ZUN]] thought appropriate for the Buddhist-themed story.&lt;ref name="interview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otIrJdoaITI|title=Interview with Chara☆Mel|access-date=August 27, 2011|author=Chara☆Mel|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is also always seen with Unzan.

In ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'', her hair is shown to be shoulder-length in a shade of cyan. Her black shoes are white, her top is a button-up blouse and she has a red orb around her neck. She also carries two rings, one in each hand. Over her blouse and skirt, she also has a black and gold Japanese-style [[Wikipedia:Kesa_(clothing)|kesa]], which she wears over her shoulder.

==Appearances==
===Games===
;''Undefined Fantastic Object''
[[File:Th12IchirinSprite.png|frame|Ichirin's sprite in ''UFO'']]
In ''[[Undefined Fantastic Object]]'', she stands guard at the [[Palanquin Ship]] in order to keep those who would prevent [[Byakuren Hijiri]]'s revival away. Initially she attacks the heroine under the assumption that they were there to stop her, but upon realizing they had some parts of the treasure needed to unseal Byakuren, she assumed they were on her side and happily let them through.
; ''Double Spoiler''
{{Stub|section}}

===Spin-offs===
;''Hopeless Masquerade''
Ichirin leaves the [[Myouren Temple|temple]] to search for her [[Byakuren Hijiri|master]], and to find her she confronts every single person Byakuren defeated before; as everyone wanted to defeat her to get revenge. When she encounters [[Byakuren]], her master scolds her for leaving the temple unsupervised and attacks her. When Byakuren is defeated, [[Mamizou]] admits that it was only her disguised. She advised going to the [[Human Village]] to see a suprise. She visits the village and finds [[Hata no Kokoro]]. Ichirin thinks Kokoro was there to perform, and after hearing that Kokoro tries to force Ichirin to attend it attacking her.

;''Urban Legend in Limbo''
Ichirin goes through Gensokyo in search of the Occult Balls after hearing the rumor of attaining enlightenment after gathering seven of them. When she gathers six, she meets [[Toyosatomimi no Miko]], who tells her said rumor is a lie, the Occult Balls are from the outside world, are responsible for the urban legends, and that she doesn't know their origins. At the end, Miko decides to fight Ichirin to see what exactly happens when you have seven of them.

;''Antinomy of Common Flowers''
In ''[[Antinomy of Common Flowers]]'', Ichirin, alongside [[Mononobe no Futo]], assists [[Toyosatomimi no Miko]] and [[Byakuren Hijiri]] in their investigation of Perfect Posession. Unlike most tag teams, she takes turns with Futo being the master of the posession. After a couple of fights, Futo gets tired and nods off while Ichirin is posessing her. As a result, the two share the same dream in the [[Dream World]].

At sundown when they return to the [[Myouren Temple]], they challenge their leaders for a chance to take over the investigation and vanquish the culprits of the incident themselves.

===Literature===
;''Forbidden Scrollery''
In Chapter 34, while [[Reimu]] interrogates [[Byakuren]], Ichirin listens to the conversation appearing to be holding an Occult Ball.

;''Wild and Horned Hermit''
In chapter 44, the [[Myouren Temple]] celebrates the paranirvana day (the day Budda died) with a giant statue of him. [[Kasen Ibara]] tries to get closer but it's interrupted by Ichirin. After hearing the little convencing explanation of how they found that statue from [[Byakuren]], Kasen realizes the truth and tells [[Reimu Hakurei]] and [[Sanae Kochiya]] about it.

The next days, Reimu takes advantage of the festival to put a food stall closer to the statue than the [[kappa]], blackmailing Ichirin with telling the truth about the statue if she didn't let her, and even telling her to ask Unzan to do something similar for the [[Hakurei Shrine]]

; ''[[Grimoire of Usami]]''

==Relationships==
;[[Unzan]]
As the Guarded, she is Unzan's handler and he is her protector. He is devoted to watching over her. As he is very shy, he will speak very quietly and only to her.
 
;[[Byakuren Hijiri]]
Not much is known about Ichirin's relationships with other characters, save for Byakuren Hijiri. She is a devout follower of Byakuren, who showed kindness not only towards her but towards Unzan as well.

;[[Minamitsu Murasa]], [[Shou Toramaru]] &amp; [[Nazrin]] 
She is also part of ''[[Minamitsu Murasa]]'''s group of youkai.

==Additional Information==
*During Stage 3, Ichirin refers to Byakuren using the words as {{lang|ja|姐御}} (anego) and {{lang|ja|姐さん}} (ane-san or nee-san). Both terms are variants on "elder sister", but these versions usually mean a female superior who is not one's real sister, such as a female gang boss.
*Essentially, [[Unzan]] ''is'' the Stage 3 boss of ''[[Undefined Fantastic Object]]'', not Ichirin; Ichirin herself came as a way to have an actual character on the screen for an [[hit box]] according to [[ZUN]]. When trying to think of what type of youkai to call Ichirin in Part 3 of ''Symposium of Post-mysticism'', even Byakuren, who calls herself an expert on youkai, could only hesitantly refer to her as "um... a controller of a giant nyuudou."
*One of her alternate color palettes in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'' resembles Index from To Aru Majutsu no Index.

{{nihongo|'''Iku Nagae'''|永江 衣玖|Nagae Iku}} is a messenger of the Dragon Palace, whose job is to observe the daily mood of the atmosphere. She sometimes questions why [[human]]s and [[youkai]] fight/duel as a part of their daily life.

==General Information==
Iku first appeared in ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]'' as the penultimate [[boss]] for most scenarios. From there, she became the [[stage]] 10 target in ''[[Double Spoiler]]'' and had a background appearance in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]''. With all of her appearances so far only being in spin-off games, she has yet to make an official appearance in a main game.

===Personality===
Iku is a laid-back youkai that never shows interest in other people. The only exception is [[Tenshi Hinanawi]], due to her egoistic attitude and the concern she has seeing her reports, which really worries and irritates Iku. As an envoy of the Dragon Palace, she sends information from the palace to other people. It's said that she is lazy and as a result, she never takes upon the position of a leader because she only observes what other people do. &lt;ref name="PSWR"&gt; Iku's Profile in ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]'' &lt;/ref&gt;

===Abilities===
;Reading the atmosphere
In her ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]'' official profile, it is stated, "she can read the mood of a place, and adapt to it right away. She doesn't try to break the mood unless there's a very urgent reason. Flexibility is stronger than stiffness. When necessary, she vanishes completely and parries any attack." However, in the neighbourhood where her speech and conduct irritate the opponent, it's a question of whether she truly reads it. (Very much so, it can be conceived that upon reading the atmosphere, she ventures to say things that give her superior mental and emotional standing than her opponent.)

;Borrowing the Dragon's power
According to [[Aya Shameimaru]] and [[Hatate Himekaidou]], Iku (and possibly the other messengers from the Dragon Palace) can borrow a bit of the [[Dragon]] God's power.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Double Spoiler]]'' - Stage 10: &lt;br /&gt;
'''Aya:''' ''Aagh, the danmaku won't disappear even if I shoot it with my camera. So this is some of the Dragon God's power...I think it's about time I gave my camera a power-up.''&lt;br /&gt;
'''Hatate:''' ''Seems like the messenger of the Dragon Palace gets to borrow a little of the Dragon God's power. I'm so jealous. The pen is stronger than the gun, but it still can't beat a dragon.'' &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Since the Dragon is known, among other things, for its power to cause rainfall, lightning and thunderstorms, this may be what allows Iku to cause and manipulate lightning on her own.

Additionally, in one interpretation, it might well be that "reading the atmosphere" is "reading the flow of air", and the ability to manipulate it. In actuality, the reason she was able to sense earthquakes was due to looking at the condition of the scarlet clouds, and reading the portents of earthquakes.

===Species===
Her profile suggests that she's a [[youkai]] of [[oarfish]]es. In Japanese, oarfishes are called {{nihongo|"Ryūgū-no-tsukai"|リュウグウノツカイor 竜宮の使い}}, which literally means "messenger from the Dragon's Palace". In this case, a [[dragon]] is considered as a [[god]] of water. Her shawls (and probably the long ribbons on her hat) are apparently modeled after the shape of oarfishes, which have thin, elongated bodies and red fins.

==Character Design==
[[File:MAGNet 20100502 3 Iku.jpg|thumb|250px|Picture of Iku drawn by [[ZUN]]]]
===Name===
Her full name is {{nihongo|''Iku Nagae''|永江 衣玖}}. {{nihongo|''Nagae''|永江}} means "eternal river", and {{nihongo|''Iku''|衣玖}} means {{nihongo|"clothing"|衣}} and number {{nihongo|"9"|玖}} or "black-colored jade". So, together, her name might mean "a black jade in (scarlet) clothing at the eternal river".

===Design===
Her portrait in ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]'' shows her having red eyes and short violet-blue hair. She wears a white and red shirt, a long black skirt, and a fedora with a red bow and two long ribbons extending out. She also has a long, white and red shawl entwined along her arms and blouse. Both the shawl and shirt glow with scarlet color.

==Appearances==
===Spin-offs===
;''Scarlet Weather Rhapsody''
:{{Main|Scarlet_Weather_Rhapsody/Story#Iku.27s_Story|l1=Scarlet Weather Rhapsody Story}}
During the events of ''Scarlet Weather Rhapsody'' she finds out that a strong earthquake is going to occur in [[Gensokyo]], so she decides to warn the residents. Afterwards, [[Yukari Yakumo]] tells her that the culprit is hiding in the [[Hakurei Shrine]]. She then goes back to the shrine and finds [[Tenshi Hinanawi]], who has just inserted a [[keystone]] to prevent the earthquake. Iku questions this and thinks of Tenshi as having been "spoiled a bit too much", so she decides to punish her.

;''Double Spoiler''
[[File:Th125IkuSprite.png|frame|Iku's sprite in ''DS'']]
In ''[[Double Spoiler]]'', Iku made her first [[shoot 'em up]] appearance on [[stage]] 10 as a target, where she uses a few [[spell card]]s and had [[Aya Shameimaru]] and [[Hatate Himekaidou]] take photos of her and her [[danmaku]].

;''Hopeless Masquerade''
[[File:Th135Iku.png|frame|Iku in ''HM'']]
Iku made a background cameo appearance in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'' on the [[Palanquin Ship]] and [[Youkai Tanuki Forest]] [[stage]]s. She can be seen floating near [[Tenshi Hinanawi]].

===Literature===
[[File:ThGK Kakashi3.jpg|thumb|Iku, as seen in ''[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]]'']]
;''Symposium of Post-mysticism''
Iku appears in the article "The Legend of the Veil Marriage Act" in [[Kakashi Spirit News]], [[Hatate Himekaidou]]'s newspaper. She made a comment about the Veil Marriage Act did by the angels.

==Relationships==
===Tenshi Hinanawi===
Iku comments to [[Tenshi Hinanawi|Tenshi]] that she was supposed to file a report before warning everyone about the earthquake, but couldn't because all of the Hinanawi clan were away from their homes. This implies that one of her duties is to file reports to the Hinanawi clan when an earthquakes about to occur (note, however, that this doesn't mean she's subservient to Tenshi's clan; just that her job requires interacting with them). It's shown in her ending that she saw how spoiled and reckless the eldest child Tenshi was, and was never happy about it. Her win quote to Tenshi implies that Iku often complained to Tenshi about how mad her father was whenever Iku reported him. To Tenshi, however, Iku was just a messenger. Tenshi's unauthorized use of a [[keystone]] finally caused Iku to take action and punish Tenshi (and for Tenshi to learn Iku's name), although having no authority over a member of the Hinanawi meant that all Iku could do in the long term was complain about it.

===[[Suika Ibuki]]===
Iku first encounters Suika when Suika's climbing to [[Heaven]] to see [[Tenshi Hinanawi]], where she tested Suika before allowing Suika to move on. Suika won, surprising Iku with her power. Iku later runs into Suika while searching for [[Tenshi Hinanawi]] to file a report on earthquakes. The [[oni]] requests Iku play with her for a bit and fights Iku in a duel. Iku's extremely confused why the oni is still in Heaven, but had to get back to her job. Eventually, after a long string of being attacked by various residents of Gensokyo for no reason whatsoever and an infuriating meeting with Tenshi, the poor exhausted oarfish arrives back in heaven and runs into the oni again. Suika's story of Tenshi giving her land gets the oarfish even more exasperated at the celestial, and Suika cheerfully comforts her and pours her a drink, encouraging Iku to vent her complaints to the oni. It's unknown if they became friends after that or not.

===The Cast of ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]''===
Everyone attacked Iku either for no reason (sometimes twice) or because they suspected her of being the cause of the incidents, leaving the oarfish confused. Exceptions are the first battles with [[Yuyuko Saigyouji]] and [[Suika Ibuki]] (which were tests to see if they could enter heaven) and [[Sakuya Izayoi]] (who managed to get Iku mad by blatantly not caring about her warnings, causing Iku to attempt to block her from Heaven. This was presumably a one-time occurrence, as Iku was nice to Sakuya and hoped to try her cooking in Iku's victory quote to her. This is actually perhaps the kindest of Iku's victory quotes, with the rest being sometimes-biting advice).

[[Yukari Yakumo]], Yuyuko Saigyouji, Suika Ibuki, and [[Tenshi Hinanawi]] are the only four characters who encounter Iku in story mode that recognize that Iku's a Dragon God messenger, implying they've seen one before.

[[Reisen Udongein Inaba]] and [[Komachi Onozuka]] don't encounter Iku in story mode and don't have particularly notable win quotes.

Oddly, Iku becomes friendly with Yukari Yakumo in Yukari's scenario when Iku learned about the keystone before Yukari. However, Yukari becomes mad at Iku in Iku's scenario when Yukari learned about the keystone before Iku (Yukari's way of informing Iku was much more vicious than Iku's way of informing Yukari).

Iku also has new victory quotes to the new characters in ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]'', but there don't seem to be any relationships of note to glean from them.

==Additional Information==
*Iku's [[spell card]] declaration pose and some alternate special move poses closely resemble John Travolta's dancing pose from the disco movie ''Saturday Night Fever''&lt;ref&gt;[https://youtu.be/u1qN6gLbUMw&amp;t=280 John Travolta's pose],  [https://youtu.be/C25HHncSA8s&amp;t=45 Iku's pose]&lt;/ref&gt;as well as the start-up of super robot Great Mazinger's move, Thunder Break&lt;ref&gt;[https://youtu.be/QxWtjWuGrws&amp;t=318 Thunder Break pose]&lt;/ref&gt;.
*Iku's dress resembles that of a Spanish Flamenco dancer, and her movements and poses look a bit like dancing. However, her official profile states that it's a special dress, granting the owner the ability to fly. Maybe it's a reference to some dances, where it looks like the dancer is flying.

'''Iku Nagae'''

Species: [[Youkai]] (Oarfish)

A youkai that lives between the world of dragons and the world of humans. Sometimes humans find traces or dead bodies of her kind, but very rarely they do show their living form to humans. It is said that they can understand a dragon's words, and only the important words are relayed to human and youkai.

The edges of their long veils radiating a scarlet color are indescribably beautiful. Rumor says that if a human wears this veil, they will be able to fly through the sky.


Location: Inside clouds

She spends most of her time swimming through clouds. Doing nothing in particular, she observes the dragon god as she swims elegantly through clouds. Thus she causes almost no harm to humans.


Ability: Reading the atmosphere.

She can read the mood of a place, and adapt to it right away. She doesn't try to break the mood unless there's a very urgent reason.

Flexibility is stronger than stiffness. When necessary, she vanishes completely and parries any attack.


Personality: Never takes the lead role. Lazy.

She's always laid-back and has no interest in others' behavior. She almost never insists on her own opinion, and mostly watches what others do.

{{nihongo|'''Iwakasa'''|岩笠}} is a character who has thus far only appeared in Chapter 4 of ''[[Cage in Lunatic Runagate]]'' as [[Fujiwara no Mokou]] reminisces to [[Keine Kamishirasawa]] about her past. He was murdered by Mokou so that she could drink the [[Hourai Elixir]] when she was overcome by the desire for immortality.

==Background Information==
In ''Cage in Lunatic Runagate'', Iwakasa is seen only from behind and shadows further obstruct view, but he appears to wear robes and have his hair in a martial ponytail. He is apparently based on the character Tsuki no Iwakasa, from the original ''[[Wikipedia:The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter|Tale of the Bamboo Cutter]]''.

==Backstory==
Around 1300 years ago, he was a subordinate of the Emperor who was ordered to dispose of the [[Hourai Elixir]]. He meets Mokou on the way up [[Wikipedia:Mount Fuji|Mount Fuji]], and at the top, they meet [[Konohana-Sakuyahime]], who tells them not to throw the elixir into the volcano, lest it become active and unstoppable even with her power. She tells them to dispose of the elixir on a different mountain. On the way down Mt. Fuji, Mokou kicks Iwakasa down a sharp decline, killing him, and steals the elixir.

==Relationships==
===Fujiwara no Mokou===
Iwakasa was murdered by [[Fujiwara no Mokou]] in order for her to steal the [[Hourai Elixir]] and become immortal. She notes that one day, she wants to travel to the top of the [[Youkai Mountain]], presumably to see [[Iwanagahime]], the goddess of immortality, and to apologize to her for what she did to Iwakasa. (NB: The Youkai Mountain was once the mountain Yatsugatake, which is the mountain [[Konohana-Sakuyahime]] suggested to Mokou and Iwakasa to bring the elixir to instead.) In the [[Cage in Lunatic Runagate/Fourth Chapter|fourth chapter]] of ''Cage in Lunatic Runagate'', it's shown that her immortality was derived indirectly from Iwakasa as well, as he saved her life prior to her immortality. Mokou feels guilt for having disposed of him just for the sake of her revenge against Kaguya. Two of her [[spell card]]s (''Limiting Edict "Curse of Tsuki-no-Iwakasa"'' and [[Imperishable Night/Spell Cards/Extra#Spell Card 199|''Forgiveness "Honest Man's Death"'']]) are named after him.

{{nihongo|'''Iwanagahime'''|石長姫}} is mentioned in Chapter 4 of ''Cage in Lunatic Runagate'' by Keine Kamishirasawa when asked by [[Fujiwara no Mokou]] what the source of the smoke from [[Youkai Mountain]] was. In chapter 26 of ''Forbidden Scrollery'' she is called plain looking, but a symbol of permanence, contrary to her sister who is lovely and a symbol of transience. [[Hieda no Akyuu|Akyuu]] prays to her in hopes of extending her lifetime. 

==Story==
;''Cage in Lunatic Runagate''
:{{Main|Cage in Lunatic Runagate/Fourth Chapter|l1=Cage in Lunatic Runagate Chapter 4}}
According to [[Keine Kamishirasawa|Keine]], Iwanagahime is a goddess of immortality and the older sister of [[Konohana-Sakuyahime]]. Long ago, the two sisters held a contest to see whether Fuji or Yatsugatake was taller. Yatsugatake won, but Sakuyahime couldn't stand there being a mountain higher than hers, so she broke apart Yatsugatake. However, since Iwanagahime was tired of her sister's attitude, she moved to Yatsugatake, causing Fuji's inextinguishable flame to disappear since Iwanagahime had control of the unchanging.

{{nihongo|'''Joon Yorigami'''|依神  女苑|Yorigami Joon}} is a pestilence [[god]] and one of the main antagonists of ''[[Antinomy of Common Flowers]]''. Together with her older sister, [[Shion Yorigami|Shion]], she robs innocent residents of [[Gensokyo]] of their wealth by bringing them financial ruin.

==General Information==
===Personality===
Joon is a remorseless thief who has no issue with using her ability to rob anybody and everybody of their wealth, having no concern at all for their wellbeing. She doesn't even care much for her own older sister, using her as a tool and belittling her. She takes pride and finds satisfaction in being called one of Gensokyo's most hated residents. She's a spendthrift who can never maintain her wealth as she's always making impulsive and extravagant purchases. She's also incredibly wasteful and can be seen throwing away money and valuables in many of her attacks. She does, however, change slightly after the events of ''Antinomy of Common Flowers'' - due to her training at the [[Myouren Temple]], she starts limiting herself to only stealing money from those who can afford losing a chunk of their wealth. &lt;ref name="JSE"&gt; ''[[Antinomy of Common Flowers]]'' - Joon and [[Shion]]'s Ending &lt;/reF&gt; 

===Abilities===
Joon is a pestilence god who brings misfortune to others. She's capable of completely draining a person's financial assets - those around her think that spending money will bring them happiness, and thus use it up as if offering it of their own free will. An example of this ability can be seen in ''[[Curiosities of Lotus Asia]]'', where she uses it on [[Sumireko Usami]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Curiosities of Lotus Asia]]'' - [[Curiosities of Lotus Asia/Chapter 32|Chapter 32]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character Design==
===Origin===
Joon is a {{nihongo|pestilence god/spirit|疫病神|yakubyougami}}. Yakubyougami assume a form of an elderly man or woman, visiting home and spread diseases. They could be repelled through an appeasement rituals/festivals, carrying protective amulets or by installing an image of [[w:Zhong Kui|Zhong Kui]] indoors, a deity in Chinese mythology traditionally known as the vanquisher of the ghosts and evil beings. In Japan specifically, Yakubyougami can be also repelled by adorning a house with [[Shimenawa]].

===Name===
Her full name is {{nihongo|Joon Yorigami|依神 女苑}}. ''Joon'' (女苑) comes from ''himejoon'' (姫女菀), the Japanese word for the [[wikipedia:Erigeron annuus|daisy fleabane]].&lt;ref name = "SCoOW"&gt;''[[Strange Creators of Outer World]]'' 2018 Spring! - [[Strange Creators of Outer World/Antinomy of Common Flowers Interview with ZUN x Iruka Unabara|Antinomy of Common Flower Interview with ZUN and Iruka Unabara]]&lt;/ref&gt; The daisy fleabane is closely related to the [[wikipedia:Erigeron philadelphicus|Philadelphia fleabane]],in Japanese called as ''harujion'' (春紫菀), is likely what her sister Shion is named after, thus reflecting their relationship as siblings. Interestingly enough, both the Philadelphia Fleabane and Daisy Fleabane is considered as an [[w: Invasive species|Invasive Species]] in Japan and disregarded as weeds on its native land of North America, just as the Yorigami sisters have a reputation for being two of the most despicable inhabitants of [[Gensokyo]]. In addition to that, the birth order of Yorigami sisters mayhaps influenced by the flower they are named after, as Philadelphia Fleabane usually blooms first around April and May, while Daisy Fleabane tends to bloom a few months later. Her family name ''Yorigami'' is composed of the kanji 依, which means "reliant" or "dependent", and 神, which means "god". The first kanji is also present in the term ''hyoui'' (憑依) meaning "possession", so it is possible that ''Yorigami'' could mean "possession god".

===Design===
In ''[[Antinomy of Common Flowers]]'' Joon has orange eyes and long light-brown hair in the shape of two curly drills with red ribbons tied in them. 

Her clothing consists of a purple wide-sleeved coat with a rose motif, a short light-pink dress with a red ribbon under it held by a black belt, brown boots, round sunglasses, and a mini top hat. She also carries a golden "Channel" bag (which may or may not be a pun on the brand [[wikipedia:Chanel|Chanel]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://tasofro.net/touhou155/manual/chara19.html#top Touhou 15.5 Manual]&lt;/ref&gt; Befitting her ability of making others give their money away and her compulsive spending habits, she sports a great variety of expensive-looking accessories like golden rings, a golden necklace, golden earrings, and golden bracelets, most of which also has gems in it. Some of her in-game portraits and animations also show her holding a feathered fan.

Both her game art and her sprite show Joon being followed by something that appear to be flames.

==Appearances==
===Games===
;''Urban Legend in Limbo''
[[Reisen Udongein Inaba|Reisen]]'s Extra story shows the beginning of the Perfect Possession incident, which was caused by Joon and Shion.
;''Antinomy of Common Flowers''
Joon, with the help of Shion, starts the events of ''Antinomy of Common Flowers'' through using Perfect Possession. Initially, they are thought to be unbeatable due to Shion's misfortune-bringing ability being brought upon their enemies by Joon switching her with the opponent's slave. Eventually, they are defeated by [[Reimu Hakurei]] and [[Yukari Yakumo]], who manipulated the border between master and slave to prevent Joon from taking control of Reimu's body. Joon is then taken to the Myouren Temple for training as punishment.

Later, Yukari orders Joon and Shion to capture every [[Dream World]] dweller that's still in Gensokyo.
[[File:Th175JoonSprite.gif|thumb|frame|right|120px|Joon's sprite in ''GI'']]
;''Touhou Gouyoku Ibun''
In [[Kanako]]’s Scenario, Kanako realizes that both of them had being recollecting as much petroleum as they could with the intention of getting rich, and she calls them egoists for that. Later, they call her poor and fight against her, only to be defeated.

In [[Minamitsu]]’s scenario, both of them call the phantom poor after she said she didn’t know what petroleum was, and they attack her after knowing she wants to stop the incident.

In their scenario, Joon and Shion go after more petroleum to get richer. After fighting Kanako, Joon enters in a backdoor in her back, and she is followed by Shion. They arrived to the [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]], where they fight [[Flandre Scarlet]]. After winning against the vampire, they enter again a door and they get out of [[Yuuma Toutetsu]]’s back, who they fight for the the “petroleum” from the [[Hell of Blood Pools]].

===Literature===
;''Curiosities of Lotus Asia''
In chapter 32, Joon uses the Perfect Possession to possess [[Sumireko Usami]] and make her spend her money on food for the party, buying meat of better quality than needed. She also used her power on [[Reimu]] and [[Rinnosuke]] to make them buy things they normally wouldn’t.

==Relationships==
;[[Shion Yorigami]]
Shion is Joon's older sister. Although Shion was fundamental for Joon's scheme during the events of ''Antinomy of Common Flowers'', she seems to not hold Shion in high regard, as she often berates her and heavily insults her as soon as they get cornered, calling her a "gloomy, poor, smelly, miser who can't do anything on her own", &lt;ref&gt; ''[[Antinomy of Common Flowers]]'' - [[Yukari]]'s Scenario &lt;/ref&gt;  and saying how there isn't anything good about her. Their relationship appears to somewhat improve, however, as Joon is much kinder to her sister in their scenario. 

In ''[[Touhou Gouyoku Ibun]]'', thanks to the oil they've been collecting, the relationship between the two seems to have changed quite a bit since their debut, as Joon doesn't insult Shion the whole time, nor does she mind when Shion calls herself a "millionaire god".

===Minor Relationships===
;[[Byakuren Hijiri]]
After Joon is defeated by Reimu and Yukari, Byakuren takes her under her wing to teach her a simpler lifestyle. However, she lately escapes the temple and keeps stealing other people's possessions, but this time from those who can afford it. &lt;ref name="JSE"/&gt;

| translation = The Most Despicable and Disastrous Younger Twin Sister&lt;br&gt;
Joon Yorigami&lt;br&gt;

Species: Pestilence god&lt;br&gt;
Ability: Causing consumption of financial assets


A god of pestilence who's strangely liked by people, but always brings misfortune to those around her and is resented in the end.&lt;br&gt;
Has a strong desire to dominate. Prideful. No self-control.

She takes hold of her targets with her fast talk, then makes them use up their money as if they're offering it of their own free will.&lt;br&gt;
As they lose their assets, their luck dwindles as well, and in the end, they're reduced to a husk of their former self.

Then, when there's no more money left to drain, it's said that she wanders off in search of another human.&lt;br&gt;
Since she possesses humans with money and brings unhappiness to them, she could in that sense be called a god who controls financial ruin.

This time around, she came up with "a plan where they'd be guaranteed not to lose," using her elder sister like a tool.&lt;br&gt;
She'd have her sister forcibly Perfect Possess their opponent, and steal all their luck in victory away from them.

{{nihongo|'''Junko'''|純狐|Junko}} is the main antagonist of [[Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom]]. She's a [[divine spirit|sagacious spirit]] and sworn enemy of [[Lunarians]] who orchestrated the invasion to the [[Moon]] for the sole purpose of killing [[Chang'e]].

==General Information==
Junko appeared as the Final [[Boss]] and Extra Boss helper in ''[[Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom]]''.

===Personality===
As a Sagacious Spirit who has purified her grudge towards Chang'e, Junko is described to be a being made out of pure fury. Her hatred is strong enough to persist after she murders Houyi, her first grudge. It got to the point where she hates Chang'e and the Lunarians even though they have nothing to do with her son's death. Because of this, she has been described to be unique compared to much of Gensokyo's inhabitants. &lt;ref name=LoLKInterview /&gt; Junko doesn't seem to care for intricateness, preferring to do things with a straightforward attitude. This is shown through her spellcards as they are purely designed for murder, instead of beauty.

Despite this, Junko has exhibited a variety of cognitive functions. She can be calm and level-headed and has a willingness to be crafty to complete her revenge, can adapt to unfavourable situations, and even forgo her plans without much issue. Junko also has standards to some degree, not wanting Gensokyo to be caught up in the crossfire, and calls the Lunarian's strategy of taking Gensokyo captive "inhumane". &lt;ref&gt; ''[[Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom]]'' - [[Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom/Story/Reimu's Extra|Reimu's Extra Stage]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Junko is also shown to be melodramatic, comparing her feud with the Lunarians to a "revenge drama" and being boastful when displaying her Danmaku. Exclaiming lines like "Are you watching Chang'e?" before fighting the protagonists.

===Abilities===
;Ability to purify anything
Junko's power to purify anything, not to be confused with the [[Impurity|Lunarian and Shinto concept of purity]], refers to the [[wikipedia:Refining|refining of substances to remove impurities]], such as in the refinement of metals. She used this power on her own grudge, strengthening it such that she became the embodiment of her resentment as a [[divine spirit]], without even a need for an identity anymore, and on [[Clownpiece]] and other hell [[fairies]], transforming them into beings of pure lifeforce that would threaten the [[Lunar Capital]]. She also claims to be able to kill the heroines unconditionally if they didn't use [[Eirin]]'s drug and got hit at least once before facing Junko.&lt;ref&gt;[[Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom/Story/Reimu's Scenario#Stage 6]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The terms used to refer to Junko's ability, {{nihongo|''junka''|純化}} or {{nihongo|''junsui''|純粋}}, differs from the terms for the Shinto concept of {{nihongo|''kegare''|穢れ}} referred to as "[[impurity]]", and {{nihongo|''kiyome''|清め}}, its "purification". So, they can be understood to mean two different things. In fact, Junko refining the hell fairies into pure embodiments of life supercharged their capacity to spread ''impurity''&lt;ref&gt;[[Clownpiece#Official Profiles]] - Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom - omake.txt&lt;/ref&gt;.

According to ZUN, Junko's power of purification is actually an ability to bring things back to their godly nature, before they had names, so it could be almost considered an ability to give birth to gods.&lt;ref name=LoLKInterview&gt;[[Strange Creators of Outer World/Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom interview with ZUN]] - Junko's section&lt;/ref&gt; The nature of nameless objects and how giving names to gods makes them manifest only one of their aspects was previously described by Rinnosuke in Chapter 15 of ''[[Curiosities of Lotus Asia]]''.

===Species===
Junko describes herself as a {{nihongo|Sagacious Spirit|仙霊|Senrei}}, Reimu indicates that she is a more pure soul than a Lunarian or youkai&lt;ref&gt;[[Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom]] - Reimu's Pointdevice/No Miss ending&lt;/ref&gt; and ZUN mentions in his interview&lt;ref name=LoLKInterview /&gt; that she is a type of [[divine spirit]], however it's difficult to make a distinction between the two so at most, she's a [[Spirit]].

==Character Design==
===Origin===
Junko may be based on {{nihongo|Chún Hú|纯狐}}, a Chinese legendary figure mentioned in the [[wikipedia:Zuo_Zhuan|''Zuǒ Zhuàn'']] historical narrative and [[wikipedia:Heavenly_Questions|''Tiānwèn'']] poems. Chún Hú, also known as {{nihongo|"Xuán Qī"|玄妻||lit. "dark lady"}}, was the wife of a [[wikipedia:Xia dynasty|Xia Dynasty]] ruler. Hòu Yì ({{nihongo|后羿}}) usurped the previous ruler (Chún Hú's former husband) and married Chún Hú, later killing her son {{nihongo|Bó Fēng|伯封}}. Chún Hú then conspired with Yi's minister to kill him as revenge. This account seems to line up with statements about Junko's past from Reisen's ending in [[Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom]].

Despite sharing a name, the Hou Yi of the Xia Dynasty was not necessarily the same one who married [[Chang'e]] and shot down the ten suns in legend. The conflation of various historical figures named "Hou Yi" has been the subject of at least one [http://www.nssd.org/articles/article_detail.aspx?id=24734556 contemporary academic paper]. Within the ''[[Touhou Project]]'' however, the disparate Hou Yi is appear to be treated as a single person.

===Name===
Her known name is {{nihongo|''Junko''|純狐}}, which is spelled with the characters for {{nihongo||純|jun|lit. "pure, clean"}} and {{nihongo||狐|ko|"[[wikipedia:fox|Fox]]"}}. Her name meaning "pure fox" fits with the seven tail-like flames behind her and her ability to purify anything.
According to her profile, she doesn't have an identity nor she desires to know what exactly she is.

===Design===
Junko wears a Chinese outfit of a red and yellow tabard with a 9-tailed fox pattern with a red sash over a wide-sleeved black dress and a black traditional Chinese crown called a dalachi (大拉翅). She has long, orange hair and red eyes. Behind her are seven light-purple flame-like tails. Although not visible in her in-game appearance, Junko's portrayal in [[Visionary Fairies in Shrine]] shows her wearing dark-colored shoes and legwear.

==Appearances==
===Games===
;''Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom''
[[File:JunkoVFiS2.png|thumb|right|180px|Junko's appearance in Visionary Fairies in Shrine]]
Junko plotted the invasion to the Moon in order to get revenge on [[Chang'e]]. She filled the Near Side of the Moon with fairies, and thus life, forcing the Lunarians to escape so she could use that moment to kill Chang'e. Knowing the Lunarians would likely flee to the [[Dream World]], she sent [[Hecatia]] to trap them there. Over half a year the Lunarians took no action against her, causing a stagnation in Junko's plan and a steady appease of her anger, growing bored every time. It was at that time when the protagonist appears before her, clean of all impurity much to her surprise. Because her anger was already appeased, she saw no goal in continuing the invasion and admitted defeat before the battle.

===Literature===
;''Visionary Fairies in Shrine''
In ''chapter 2'' she makes an appearance when [[Clownpiece]] talks about why wasn't she born in the [[Gensokyo|Earth]] instead of [[Hell]].&lt;br&gt;
Again, in ''chapter 5'', she's mentioned by [[Eirin]] because she didn't know Junko was working alongside a [[Hecatia|Goddess of Hell]].
;''Wild and Horned Hermit''
Junko makes an appearance when [[Kasen]] and [[Marisa]] talk about how the urban legend and Lunarian invasion incidents never got proper resolutions.

==Relationships==
;[[Hecatia Lapislazuli]]
Junko and Hecatia are friends. Because Hecatia sympathized with Junko, she accompanied her in her plot against the [[Lunar Capital]], lending Junko her powers, as well as fairies like Clownpiece.

;[[Clownpiece]]
Hecatia loaned Clownpiece to Junko to use as she wished. Clownpiece was purified into pure lifeforce and simply told to do what fairies do and play around near the [[Lunar Capital]], at the [[Sea of Tranquility]].

;[[Chang'e]]
Junko has a grudge against Chang'e, because Chang'e's husband was responsible for killing Junko's son. So, she plotted against the Lunar Capital and staged an invasion to get to Chang'e.

==Spell Cards==
Junko's [[spell card|spell cards]] contain some of the most simplistic patterns ever for a final boss of the ''[[Touhou Project]]''. Her spell cards are designed "purely" to do just that rather than showing off various kinds of patterns. Most of her spell cards use circle danmaku shapes, which is significant as [[wikipedia:Circle|circles]]&lt;ref&gt;The kanji for {{nihongo|circle|丸}} can also mean ''perfection'', as an allude to a "flawless" shape.&lt;/ref&gt; are widely viewed as ''"pure shapes"''.

Her spell cards violate the spirit of the spell card rules. While the rules were in part designed to prevent bloodshed, Junko has multiple spell cards made to kill.

==Additional Information==
*Junko is the first [[Windows]] era character with an official profile who does not have a proper title. This is likely because she purified herself of identifying information. [[Koakuma]] and [[Daiyousei]] also do not have titles, but they also do not have official profiles.
**She is also notable for being the first final [[boss]] in the Windows era not to have a last name.
*A silhouette of Junko occupies the front of ''[[Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom]]'''s jewel case.

　　「月の表側を、生命力を純化した妖精で満たし、&lt;br&gt;
　　　月そのものを生命の星にしてしまおう。&lt;br&gt;
　　　それによって、月の都は逃げ出すしか無い。&lt;br&gt;
　　　その隙を突いて、匿われている嫦娥を討つ」&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

　　地上が穢れ（生命）で溢れるのを厭い、月に移住したのが月の都の始まりである。&lt;br&gt;
　　それと同じ事を月でも起こそうとしたのだ。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;


　　計画は順調だった。&lt;br&gt;
　　静かの海は生命で満たされはじめた。&lt;br&gt;
　　地獄の妖精達は、月を楽園だと思っていたようだ。&lt;br&gt;
　　それほど地獄の環境は過酷なのだろう。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

　　月の民は、彼女の生命の星計画に手も足も出なかった。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

　　しかし、純狐には判っていた。&lt;br&gt;
　　月の民はそのまま穢れの近くに居るはずが無い、夢の世界かどこかに逃げ込むだろう。&lt;br&gt;
　　だから、先を読んでそこに友人を送り込んでいた。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;


　　予想通りというか、期待外れというか、月の民は半年以上何の動きも見せなかった。&lt;br&gt;
　　純狐もまた、月の都を攻めあぐねていた。双方手が出せない膠着状態が続いていた。&lt;br&gt;
　　少しずつ、彼女の怒りは収まり、これからどうしようかと考えなおす頃合いであった。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;


　　そんな時、現われたのはまさかの人間だった。&lt;br&gt;
　　しかも穢れが浄化された人間である。何らかの薬の影響だろうか。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

　　生命を厭わず、生命を感じない。&lt;br&gt;
　　そんな人間を犠牲にした奇策をうってくるなんて思ってもみなかったが、彼女は安心した。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

　　月の賢者は予想できない事をやってくる。&lt;br&gt;
　　それが彼女の楽しみなのだ。&lt;br&gt;
　　そして、ようやく今回の復讐劇は終わるのだと。

Junko&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Species: [[Divine spirit]]&lt;br&gt;
Ability: Capable of purifying anything&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

A being who holds a deep resentment for the [[Lunarians]].&lt;br&gt;
She herself is a spirit who has been purified by that resentment.&lt;br&gt;
By now, she has no need even for information on what exactly she is.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

She had a deep grudge against [[Chang'e]], one of the Lunarians.&lt;br&gt;
Details are included in one of the game's endings, so things will be kept brief here,&lt;br&gt;
but it seems that she calmed her rage against the sages by repeatedly attacking the [[Lunar Capital]].&lt;br&gt;
Her first grudge came about when her husband killed her child, but said grudge has already been purified&lt;br&gt;
to the point where her anger stands on its own.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Her existence is unknown to all but a select few of the Lunarians.&lt;br&gt;
It was hardly necessary for them to live in fear of her, after all.&lt;br&gt;
It's unknown if Chang'e has full knowledge of who she is, but she's likely aware of her to some extent.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Chang'e doesn't appear in the game itself, but she's a goddess of the Moon imprisoned in the Lunar Capital.&lt;br&gt;
She rules over the [[Rabbit|moon rabbits]] and is extremely powerful, but she doesn't show herself publicly.&lt;br&gt;
She is also a criminal who drank the [[Hourai Elixir]].&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Junko's plan to attack the Lunar Capital was as follows.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

"I'll fill the Near Side of the Moon with [[fairy|fairies]] whose life force I purified,&lt;br&gt;
turning the Moon itself into a planet with life on it.&lt;br&gt;
Thus, the Lunar Capital's residents will have no choice but to flee.&lt;br&gt;
Then I'll seize that opportunity, and shoot Chang'e down as she's escaping."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The Lunar Capital was first founded by people who migrated to the Moon to escape the Earth's impurity (life force).&lt;br&gt;
Junko was going to cause the same thing to happen on the Moon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The plan went well.&lt;br&gt;
The [[Sea of Tranquility]] began to fill with life.&lt;br&gt;
It seemed that the fairies from [[Hell]] thought the Moon to be a paradise.&lt;br&gt;
That's how awful the environment in Hell must've been.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The Lunarians couldn't raise a finger against her 'Planet with Life' plan.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

However, Junko knew.&lt;br&gt;
The Lunarians would hardly wait around near all that impurity, and would flee into the [[Dream World]].&lt;br&gt;
Anticipating this, she sent [[Hecatia Lapislazuli|one of her friends]] over there as well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Just as she planned, but perhaps not quite as she expected, the Lunarians showed no sign of action for over half a year.&lt;br&gt;
Junko was again at a loss as to how to attack the Lunar Capital. Both sides were locked in a stalemate.&lt;br&gt;
As her anger gradually began to settle, she thought she might have to reconsider her course of action.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

It was then that a [[human]], of all things, appeared before her.&lt;br&gt;
Not just any human, but one whose impurity had been wiped clean away. Likely due to the effects of some drug.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

They did not abhor life, but no life could be felt from them.&lt;br&gt;
She never imagined that they'd come up with such a plan to send such a human in, but she felt at ease.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The lunar sages had done something she never expected.&lt;br&gt;
She could at least enjoy that fact.&lt;br&gt;
And thus, her current revenge drama came to a close.

{{nihongo|'''Kagerou Imaizumi'''|今泉 影狼|Imaizumi Kagerou}} is a [[Therianthrope|werewolf]] who lives in the [[Bamboo Forest of the Lost]].

==General Information==
Like [[Keine Kamishirasawa]] and her were-hakutaku transformation, Kagerou acquires some characteristics of a wolf during a full moon, but she also has the ability to turn into an actual wolf (as demonstrated during her spell cards). To be exact, she is a were-[[Wikipedia:Honshu wolf|Honshu wolf]]. The Honshu wolf is a species of wolf that has gone extinct in the outside world.

===Personality===
She is said to have a calm personality and a calmer demeanor than one would expect from a werewolf. Also, she lives quietly and hates becoming hairy in full moon nights. This calmness is not lost when she transforms. &lt;ref name="PDDC"&gt; ''[[Double Dealing Character]]'' - Kagerou's Profile &lt;/ref&gt;

===Abilities===
;Transforming into a wolf
In full moon nights, she transforms in a wolf, becoming hairy and stronger. It is unknown if she suffers other changes.

==Character Design==
===Name===
Her first name {{nihongo|''Kagerou''|影狼}} literally means "Shadow Wolf". It is also homophonous to the word {{nihongo|''Kagerou''|陽炎}}, which means the shimmering of hot air, which refers to the Honshu wolf species' state of extinction. Her surname, {{nihongo|''Imaizumi''|今泉}}, is a reference to the Japanese zoologist {{nihongo|Yoshinori Imaizumi|今泉吉典}}, who first researched the Honshu wolf. It's spelled with the characters for "now" and "spring".

===Design===
Kagerou has hip-length dark auburn hair and red eyes. She has two wolf ears, her nails are long and claw-like, and there appears to be black fur poking out from under her sleeves. She wears a long-sleeved dress with a design based on the [[Wikipedia:Hanafuda|Hanafuda]] card for Pampas Grass and the Full Moon; the red on the dress represents the red sky, the white represents the moon, and the black hash-patterned trim at the bottom represents the hill of pampas grass.  At the neck of her dress is a red amulet or brooch. A long, loose piece of black fabric goes around the back of her neck and rests on her shoulders; it appears to be fastened at the front by the amulet/brooch.

As shown in ''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'', she seems to keep the same appearance, including her animal ears, even without the full moon.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'' - Chapter 20&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Miracle Mallet's power floods into Gensokyo, Kagerou becomes aggressive and attacks the heroine as they fly through the Bamboo Forest of the Lost. After the incident is resolved, she calms back down.

&lt;Insert Summary&gt;--&gt;

===Spin-offs===
;''Impossible Spell Card''
Presumably from hearing or seeing a wanted sign about the mischief-making [[amanojaku]] [[Seija Kijin]], Kagerou appears to be one of the many [[youkai]] that tries to capture her. She uses [[spell card]]s that are considered impossible to dodge, and forces Seija to make use of different tools.

===Literature===
;''Alternative Facts in Eastern Utopia''
[[Aya Shameimaru]] informs about a new game created by Kagerou called "Are you a human?", which consists in a moderator who selects randomly a "human" who will have to fake being a youkai. The other players have to "eat" who they think is the human. Kagerou claimed that [[Rinnosuke Morichika|the owner of Kourindou]] show her the game when she asked him for advice to chat with people.

==Relationships==
===Wakasagihime===
Kagerou knows [[Wakasagihime]] thanks to the [[Grassroots Youkai Network]], where she seems to know Wakasagihime's general personality. Kagerou stated that she once tried to eat Wakasagihime by mistake.&lt;ref name="DDCMarisaB"&gt;[[Double Dealing Character]]: [[Double Dealing Character/Story/Marisa B's Scenario|Marisa B's Scenario]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Additional Information==
*She's the first werewolf in a remotely traditional sense to appear in the series.
**She has a serious dislike of how hairy she'd get on a full moon, making her normally far less aggressive than most werewolves.

Ability: Ability to transform into a wolf on the night of the full moon

A person with a calm personality.&lt;br /&gt;
Even when she transforms into a wolf, her composure isn't lost.

It seems that there are many youkai related to the moon in the Bamboo Forest of the Lost,&lt;br /&gt;
perhaps because people from the moon built a mansion there.&lt;br /&gt;
She is one of those youkai.

By the way, she is a were-Honshu wolf, a species extinct in the outside world.

She lives quietly, hiding her skin as if concerned&lt;br /&gt;
that she'll turn all hairy on the night of the full moon.

This time, she began to go berserk for some reason; this reached Reimu's ears,&lt;br /&gt;
and she was exterminated.

{{nihongo|'''Kaguya Houraisan'''|蓬莱山　輝夜|Houraisan Kaguya}} is the main antagonist of [[Imperishable Night]]. She was once a princess of the [[Lunarian]]s, a race of people living on the [[Moon]]. For the crime of creating the [[Hourai Elixir]], she and [[Eirin Yagokoro]] were exiled to the Earth, where they came to live in what would eventually become [[Gensokyo]]. She is currently the princess of [[Eientei]].

==General Information==
Kaguya first appeared as the true final [[boss]] in ''[[Imperishable Night]]'', then appeared as a [[stage]] 9 target in ''[[Shoot the Bullet]]''. She made a brief cameo in the backstory of ''[[Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom]]''.

===Personality===
Kaguya has a rather carefree personality, as she often sneaks out to visit the human village.&lt;ref&gt; [[Foul Detective Satori]] Chapter 16&lt;/ref&gt; She apparently is refined in the art of conversation, but her spoken language is a bit dated.&lt;ref name="PMiSSKaguya"&gt;''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'': [[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Kaguya Houraisan|Kaguya]]&lt;/ref&gt; She is also described as haughty and relatively wild.&lt;ref&gt;[[Touhou Bougetsushou]] ~ [[Silent Sinner in Blue]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abilities===
;Manipulating eternity and the instantaneous
[[File:GoMIllus-Kaguya.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Kaguya, as illustrated in ''[[The Grimoire of Marisa]]'']]
Eternity is namely immutability, and it can be said that eternity rejects all change. Things that possess eternity indefinitely don't change, and also cannot be interfered by things outside of it. By using her ability on everything in Eientei, she made it so that living things stopped aging, objects would never break, and food would never spoil.&lt;ref name=CiLR_Chapter2&gt;[[Cage in Lunatic Runagate]] - Chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, beginning from when Kaguya came to [[Gensokyo]], she has lived hidden away for hundreds of years, but until the Eternal Night incident, she continued having an existence in the interior of the [[Bamboo Forest of the Lost]] without anybody knowing about her. Also, the pure Japanese-style building [[Eientei]] can be seen not to have worn out at all, which can be said to have been due to this ability of eternity. After the Eternal Night incident, Kaguya removed the spell of eternity from Eientei, causing objects to break as normal, living things to age again, and food to spoil if not eaten in time.&lt;ref name=CiLR_Chapter2 /&gt; 

Incidentally, as the [[Hourai Elixir]] made by Kaguya's ability of eternity is something that makes the consumer have a "body that rejects all change", it can simply be said to be a kind of maximised, self-healing ability (due to this, it's said that a the whole-body can recover from a single hair, as for [[Fujiwara no Mokou]]). In the last [[spell card]] "''End of Imperishable Night''" which used this ability, it destroyed [[Reimu Hakurei]] and the others' spell of eternity, and forcibly called for dawn (''End of Imperishable Night -Rising World-'', where "Rising World" was a homophone to "dawn" as {{nihongo||夜明け|"yoake"}}).

With "instantaneous", it's namely the gaps, the instant that's impossible to recognise the existence of anything else. Kaguya, in being able to manipulate the instantaneous, is able to alter the needed "instants" and make them her own time. However, whatever she gathers together, since the fact that they're the "unrecognisable instant" can't be changed, she has no means of knowing what's within the instant. For this reason, in manipulating the instantaneous, Kaguya's able to spend "time the same as others'" and "time different from others'" simultaneously. [[Hieda no Akyuu]] presented this as "having parallel timelines at the same time." In the nineteenth chapter of ''[[Silent Sinner in Blue]]'', as the instantaneous is the smallest unit of time, time is able to accumulate countless instants. [[Watatsuki no Toyohime]] explained that to see time as continuous is due to the inability to recognise the instant.

Since her ability can be said to be the ability to manipulate "complete stop = eternity" and "extreme speed-up = instant", Akyuu also summarised it as an "ability to manipulate time". This seems very similar to [[Sakuya Izayoi]]'s "ability to manipulate time".

==Backstory==
[[File:CiLR Cover2.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Kaguya on the cover of ''[[Cage in Lunatic Runagate]]'']]
Over a thousand years ago, Kaguya was born in the royal house of the [[Moon]] and was treated with utmost care as a princess. However, she got selfish, and managed to get [[Eirin Yagokoro]] to create the [[Hourai Elixir]] out of self-interest and consumed it. This was illegal, and she was executed. She was [[immortal]], so therefore she was executed many times, but as she could not permanently be killed, she was exiled to Earth and forced to live among humans as punishment. She was found by a bamboo cutter and dwelt among the humans she had once despised. Though the Lunarians looked upon humans with contempt, Kaguya came to love her new home. She enjoyed her life
on Earth for a while without problems, but as rumours of her beauty spread far and wide, she started to feel bad about it. Tales of her unearthly beauty led men from all across the land to seek her hand in marriage, [[Fujiwara no Mokou]]'s father being one of them, but none could successfully complete her trial of the Five Impossible Requests.

The first was to bring her the stone begging bowl of the [[wikipedia:Buddha|Buddha]] from India. The second was to retrieve a jeweled branch from the island of [[wikipedia:Mount Penglai|Mount Hourai]]. The third was to seek the legendary robe of the fire-rat of China. The fourth was to retrieve a colored jewel from a dragon's neck. The final task was to find the legendary [[wikipedia:Cowry|Cowry]] treasure of the swallows. These potent treasures were eventually revealed to already be in Kaguya's possession in the final stage of ''[[Imperishable Night]]''.

After years of exile, powerful emissaries arrived from the Moon; Kaguya had been forgiven of her crime and it had been decided that she should return. Kaguya, however, had grown to love life on Earth, which was far more emotional than the life she had on the Moon, and had no desire to return to the lunar capital permanently. Even so, Earth was filthy and life on Earth had its share of problems. She was torn between Earth and the moon, but she discovered Eirin to be an emissary. Eirin was apologetic to Kaguya since she wasn't punished for creating the elixir. Her desire for redemption was so strong that she was ready to do anything for Kaguya, so she decided to live on Earth with Kaguya. Eirin betrayed the other emissaries and helped Kaguya escape and fled to what would eventually be [[Gensokyo]]. Taking refuge in an ancient manor called [[Eientei]] hidden deep within the [[Bamboo Forest of the Lost]], the two Lunarians began a new exile.
[[File:Cilr1-118-scaled.jpg|thumb|200px|Illustration of Kaguya in ''CiLR'']]
Eventually, the Moon stopped sending emissaries to fetch them; they had forgotten about the past and were living in peace. One day, an event took place that made them recall the past, a century since Gensokyo was sealed. On that day, a self-claimed Moon [[rabbit]] name [[Reisen Udongein Inaba]] ran into their home, who come because she heard rumors about Gensokyo. She then stated that [[human]]s were invading the Moon, sticking the [[Wikipedia:Flag of the United States|American flag]], on the moon and acting like the moon belonged to them, making it nearly impossible for people of the Moon to live there. The rabbit had escaped from the frontline of a war, leaving her allies behind. Kaguya remembered that she, too, was a Lunarian long ago, and they decided to allow Reisen to live with them. After several centuries of isolation, she was eventually reunited with Mokou, who had also used the Hourai Elixir to become immortal, and the two continued their feud, murdering each other on a nearly daily basis.

A few decades have passed since then. On one night of a full Moon, Reisen received a transmission from other surviving moon rabbits, stating that a new war will be starting soon and Reisen needs to return. She doesn't want to, so Kaguya and Eirin defended her, but if they kill the emissaries, they'll have to go into hiding for a long time again. Eventually, Eirin came up with a plan to replace the real Moon with a fake one, thus making it no longer possible to travel between Earth and the Moon. Their only mistake was underestimating the power of Gensokyo's natives, who rely on the power of the moon, which caused the incident of ''Imperishable Night''. In the end, humans and youkai succeeded in dispelling the fake moon, and Gensokyo was already sealed by the [[Great Hakurei Barrier]]', so the Lunarians wouldn't have been able to enter Gensokyo to begin with. Kaguya, Eirin and Reisen were enjoying their peaceful life in Gensokyo.

==Character Design==
[[File:PMiSS kaguya.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Kaguya, as illustrated in ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]''.]]
===Origin===
Kaguya, and the whole of ''[[Imperishable Night]]'', is inspired by the Japanese legend of the Moon Princess, also known as the ''[[Wikipedia:The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter|The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter]]'', sometimes called the legend of "[[Kaguya-hime]]" (Princess Kaguya).

===Name===
Her full name is {{nihongo|''Kaguya Houraisan''|蓬莱山　輝夜}}. Her first name {{nihongo||輝夜|Kaguya}}, means "shining night", "sparkling night", or "radiant night".

{{nihongo||蓬莱山|Houraisan}} refers to "[[wikipedia:Mount Penglai|Mount Hourai]]". Mount Hourai (Penglai in Chinese) is the name of a legendary mountain that floats above the sea. Its inhabitants were said to possess, among other treasures, the elixir of immortality. It was also the destination of one of [[Kaguya-hime]]'s impossible tasks.

Thus, her full name literally means "[a] (shining/sparkling/radiant) night [on] Mount Hourai."

===Design===
Kaguya is shown to have dark brown eyes and very long black hair in a [[wikipedia:Hime cut|hime cut]] style. She wears a pink shirt with many white bows, and a long, dark burgundy skirt decorated in plants and flowers representing the four seasons. Respectively, they are cherry blossoms&lt;ref&gt;https://floweryseason.com/sakura/&lt;/ref&gt;, bamboo leaf&lt;ref&gt;https://floweryseason.com/natsu-shinryoku/#i-23&lt;/ref&gt;, maple leaf&lt;ref&gt;https://floweryseason.com/kouyou&lt;/ref&gt; and plum blossoms&lt;ref&gt;https://floweryseason.com/fuyu-hana-ki/#i-2&lt;/ref&gt;. Her 5 Impossible Requests are seen floating around her, probably waiting for her order to engage in a [[spell card]] attack.

;''Imperishable Night''
[[File:Th08KaguyaSprite.png|frame|Kaguya's sprite in ''IN'']]
During the events of ''[[Imperishable Night]]'', Kaguya had been hidden in a secret pathway along with the true moon by Eirin to ensure any Lunarians sent to recover [[Reisen Udongein Inaba]] wouldn't discover her. The heroines of ''Imperishable Night'', however, ''did'' discover her, and challenged her to return the full moon to Gensokyo. After being defeated, Kaguya unleashed her powers of eternity in an all-out bid to break the spell of the imperishable night cast by the heroines. Finally she relented and the true moon was recovered.

&lt;Insert Summary&gt;--&gt;

She now spends her days living in Eientei in a carefree manner, sometimes holding exhibitions of Lunarian treasures there for the rest of Gensokyo to admire. Her long isolation has made her lonely, and she enjoys telling stories to any guests she might receive.

;''Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom''
Kaguya is shown in the backstory of ''[[Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom]]''. She knew that the [[moon rabbit]]s from the [[Lunar Capital]] will come to [[Gensokyo]] and [[Purity|purify]] Earth. Both her and [[Eirin Yagokoro]] know that [[human]]s can't compete against the enemy, so Eirin has created a medicine just for this occasion.

===Spin-offs===
;''Shoot the Bullet''
[[File:Th135Kaguya.png|frame|Kaguya in ''HM'']]
In ''[[Shoot the Bullet]]'', [[Aya Shameimaru]] encountered Kaguya on [[stage]] 9 and took photos of her [[danmaku]].

;''Hopeless Masquerade''
Kaguya made a background cameo appearance in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'' on the [[Human Village]] stage. She's seen sitting with [[Tewi Inaba]], [[Eirin Yagokoro]] and [[Reisen Udongein Inaba]], where she'll occasionally close her eyes and fall asleep.

;''Touhou Bougetsushou''

;''Forbidden Scrollery''

;''Cheating Detective Satori''
Kaguya first appeared in chapter 12 where she was chatting with Reimu about the vengeful ghost that was targeting her. She simply at first brushed off the topic at hand until she received a threat in a form of a letter. Secretly, she and Eirin planned on using her as bait to lure out the culprit. Unknown to everyone, however, Kaguya was already possessed by the vengeful spirit at that time. Her body was later left in the Bamboo Forest when the culprit possessed Mokou.

==Relationships==
;[[Eirin Yagokoro]]
Eirin is Kaguya's servant and friend. She's also the one who made the Hourai Elixir for Kaguya, and when sent to Earth to bring her back on the Moon, she killed the other emissaries and helped Kaguya hiding herself. Now she serves Kaguya faithfully at Eientei.

;[[Reisen Udongein Inaba]] (Fellow Exile, Pet)
Reisen is loyal to Kaguya, and Kaguya has shown to be caring of her as seen in endings in [[Imperishable Night]] and [[Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom]]. 

;[[Tewi Inaba]] (Allied Earth Rabbit)
In return for letting her live on the land, Kaguya and Eirin freely give her information and technology. They also work in tandem with each other on certain plans such as ones shown in [[Forbidden Scrollery]] and [[Wild and Horned Hermit]]. 

;[[Fujiwara no Mokou]]
Mokou and Kaguya seem to have a mutual rivalry. The two fight, compete, and even kill each other for fun and to alleviate the boredom of eternal life. In Imperishable Night, Kaguya sends the player characters to fight with Mokou, calling it a "trial of guts."

Although their rivalry is usually thought to be serious, Mokou has expressed care for Kaguya (though unbeknowst to her). &lt;ref name="CiLRCh4"&gt;[[Cage in Lunatic Runagate]]: [[Cage in Lunatic Runagate/Fourth_Chapter|Chapter 4]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Additional Information==
*A silhouette of Kaguya occupies the front of ''[[Imperishable Night]]'''s jewel case.
*Kaguya has a larger [[spell card]] arsenal than either [[Remilia Scarlet]] or [[Yuyuko Saigyouji]] and attacks confidently and without hesitation in the actual game.
*It can be conjectured that Mokou and Kaguya's rivalry symbolizes for the cycle of the Sun and the Moon: Kaguya, the Lunar Princess, and Mokou, who uses as an in-game avatar a fire bird that strongly resembles a phoenix.
*Kaguya was planned to debut as a playable character in ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]'', but the plot involving her and Mokou was eventually scrapped.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.shrinemaiden.org/forum/index.php?topic=18442.0&lt;/ref&gt;

種族：月人&lt;br&gt;
能力：永遠と須臾を操る程度の能力&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;


カグヤは月の民の一族であり、月の姫として大切に育てられていた。その為、我侭し放題に育てられていたのだ。しかし、ある事件を気にカグヤの生活は大きく変わる。興味本位で永琳に、禁断の秘薬である蓬莱の薬を作らせてしまい、それに手を出してしまったのだ。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

その事はすぐにばれてしまい、カグヤは処刑された。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

だが、永遠の力を持ったカグヤは死んでもすぐに生まれ変わり、事実上死ぬ事は出来なかった。カグヤは罰として次の生は地上の賤しき民と暮らす様に命じられ地上に落とされた。間も無くして、一人の地上人に発見され、そこで輝夜という名前で暮らす事となった。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　――&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

輝夜は地上で生まれ、地上で生活をしている元月の民である。暫らくの間、何の不自由も無く生活が出来ていたのだが……。どんどんと人が寄って来るようになり、地上も生活しにくくなってきていた。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

数年後、晴れて輝夜の罪も償われ月に帰る時が来た。しかし、お世話になった地上人への恩と情、心のある地上での生活、どうしても帰りたくない。だが穢ない処もあり、生活しにくい部分もある。輝夜は思い悩んでいた。そんな時月からやってきた使者の中に見覚えのある姿を見た。永琳である。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

永琳は薬を作っておいて自分だけは無罪だった事もあり、輝夜に対し申し訳ない心でいっぱいだった。その気持ちは強く、輝夜の為なら何でもしてやらなければ、と考えていた。そして輝夜と一緒に地上で暮らすことを決めたのだ。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

永琳は月の使者を裏切り、輝夜を逃した。こうして、二人は人里離れた山奥でひっそりと隠れて暮らす様になった。そう、そこは妖怪も出るような山奥で……。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　――&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

――それから、本当に長い時間が経った。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

いつしか月から使者が訪れる事はなくなっていたし、二人はとっくに昔の事など忘れて平和に暮らしていたのだ。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

だが、そんな平和なある日、輝夜の記憶を呼び戻す出来事が起きる。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

幻想郷が人間界と遮断されてから、もうすぐ百年も経とうとしていた頃だった。輝夜はいつも通り誰とも会わずひっそりと暮らしていた。そんなある日、一匹の妖怪兎が輝夜の元に逃げ込んできたのだ。その兎は実は月の兎だといい、人間以外が住む幻想郷の噂を聞きつけ、なんとか入り込んできたという。その兎が言うには、「月に敵が攻め込&lt;span style="white-space: nowrap;"&gt;んで来てもう生活出来なくなった、そいつらは月に自分達の旗を立て、&lt;/span&gt;自分達の物だと言って好き勝手やっている」、らしい。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

兎は月の民が戦っている中、仲間を見捨てて命からがら逃げてきたという事だった。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

輝夜は自分が月の人だと言う事を思い出した。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

人間が月に攻め入る？&lt;br&gt;
そんな馬鹿な事があるわけが無い。&lt;br&gt;
半信半疑だったが、その兎は嘘を付いている様には見えなかった。&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style="white-space: nowrap;"&gt;とにかく可哀相な兎、――名はレイセンと言う、を家に置く事にした。&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

――さらにその出来事から数十年経った。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

輝夜と永琳、鈴仙の三人は、また退屈な日々を送っていた。&lt;br&gt;
ここに居ると誰でものんきで平和的になってしまう。まさに楽園の様な処だった。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

そんなある満月の夜、月の兎同士が使うという兎の波動を鈴仙が受信した。これは、どんなに離れていてもその大きな耳で会話が出来るという月の兎の特殊能力である。&lt;br&gt;
その内容は以下の様なものだった。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

「賤しき地上人は月の魔力を搾取し、月に基地を作ると言い出した。&lt;br&gt;
　我々月の民は、人間とどうにか共存の方向で協議していたが、&lt;br&gt;
　もう限界である。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

　我々月の民は、地上人に最後の全面戦争を仕掛ける事にした。&lt;br&gt;
　今の状況では、戦力は我々の方が若干不利に見える。敵の近代兵器&lt;br&gt;
　は我々の想像をはるかに越えていたのだ。&lt;br&gt;
　だが臆する事は無い、我々月の民には何千年も生きてきた知恵と誇&lt;br&gt;
　りがある。負けるはずが無い。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

　レイセン、もうすぐ月は戦場となる。&lt;br&gt;
　誇り高き我々と一緒に戦ってくれないだろうか。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

　そして、一緒に居ると思われる地上人に伝えてくれ。&lt;br&gt;
　次の満月の夜にレイセンを迎えに行く。&lt;br&gt;
　抵抗しても無駄だ。」、と。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

鈴仙はそろそろ月に帰らなければいけないと、輝夜達に伝えた。だが一緒に住んでいる輝夜達も、地上人ではなく月の民だったのだ。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

――輝夜の記憶がよみがえる。&lt;br&gt;
　　罪を犯す前の月での生活を。&lt;br&gt;
　　賤しき地上人と暮らしていた頃を。&lt;br&gt;
　　自分を迎えに来た月の使者を殺害し、隠れて暮らしてきた事を。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

輝夜は永琳と相談し、鈴仙を月に返さない事に決めた。使者を殺してしまっては、また場所を変え、隠れ住す必要が出てしまう。だが、もう身を隠して暮らす事に飽きたのだ。何とか月の使者を追っ払い、かつ堂々と地上で暮らす事が出来ないのかと、永琳に相談した。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

永琳は輝夜の相談が言い終わるかどうか、という位で瞬時にこう返答した。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

「ならば地上から満月を無くせば良い。&lt;br&gt;
　さすれば、月と地上は行き来できなくなる。&lt;br&gt;
　地上から見える満月は、月と地上を行き来する唯一の鍵なのだ。&lt;br&gt;
　だから、満月の夜にしか使者は訪れない。&lt;br&gt;
　その鍵を壊せば……、&lt;br&gt;
　地上は、大きな密室になる。」&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

と。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

輝夜達は、本物の満月を隠し、地上人が見る空に浮かぶ月を偽物の月とすり替え、そしてほんの少しだけ、欠けさせたのである。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

これで、地上と月を行き来する事は不可能になった。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

ただ、唯一の誤算は、満月の力に頼っていたはずの妖怪達の力が、これほどまで強い物だとは思わなかった事である。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

結局、人間と妖怪の力によってこの術は破れてしまったが、そもそも幻想郷は閉ざされた空間。元々、月からも入ってくる事は出来なかったと言う事を知った。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

今は輝夜達は隠れて暮らすのをやめ、普通に永遠亭で暮らしている。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

月？&lt;br&gt;
月が結局どうなったのかは、地上に這いつくばって暮らす民である輝夜達には知る由もなかった。
&lt;/p&gt;

'''Kaguya Houraisan'''&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Species: [[Lunarian]]&lt;br&gt;
Ability: Manipulating eternity and the instantaneous&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Kaguya (カグヤ) was born in the royal house of the [[moon]] and was treated with utmost care as a princess. Because of that, she grew very selfish... But one scandal changed her life. She had [[Eirin Yagokoro | Eirin]] make the [[Hourai Elixir]] - a forbidden medicine - out of self-interest and consumed it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The crime was soon discovered and Kaguya was executed for it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

However, possessing the power of eternity, Kaguya immediately resurrected upon dying, so effectively she could not die. For Kaguya's punishment, she was exiled to Earth and forced to live among filthy [[human]]s. Soon afterward, she was found by an old human male, and began life as [[Kaguya-hime]]...&lt;br&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;——&lt;/div&gt;

Kaguya is a former [[Lunarian]] who was expelled from the moon. She enjoyed her life on Earth for a while without problems, but as rumours of her beauty spread far and wide, she started to feel bad about it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

A few years later, she was allowed to return to the moon, but she really didn't want to. She had become attached to people who she were living with and preferred life on Earth, which was far more emotional than the life she had on the moon. Even so, Earth was a bit filthy and life on Earth had its share of problems. She was torn between Earth and the moon... It was then that she found a familiar face among the emissaries from the moon. It was [[Eirin Yagokoro|Eirin]].&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Eirin felt very sorry for Kaguya because she wasn't punished even though she was the one who made the elixir. Her desire for redemption was so strong that she was ready to do anything for Kaguya, so she decided to live on Earth with Kaguya.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Eirin betrayed the other emissaries and helped Kaguya escape. The two of them began to live in desolate place. It was so desolate that it was haunted by [[youkai]]... &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;——&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;

A long, long time has passed since then.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The [[moon]] was no longer sending emissaries to fetch them; they had forgotten about the past and were living in peace.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

One day, an event took place that made them recall the past.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

It had been more than a century since [[Gensokyo]] was cut from the human world. They were living quietly without meeting anyone. On that day, a rabbit ran into their home. She claimed to be a rabbit from the moon who had come because she heard rumours about Gensokyo, a place where non-humans live. She then said, "[[human]]s are invading the moon and it's becoming nearly impossible for people of the Moon to live there. These humans stuck a flag on the moon and are acting like the moon belongs to them".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The rabbit had escaped from the front line of a war, leaving her allies behind... &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Kaguya remembered that she, too, was a [[Lunarian]] long ago.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Humans were invading the moon? That's ridiculous...But the rabbit seemed to be telling the truth. Anyway, they decided to allow that poor rabbit - [[Reisen Udongein Inaba|Reisen]] - to live with them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

A few decades have passed since then.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Kaguya, Eirin and Reisen were enjoying their peaceful life. Gensokyo makes everyone easy-going and peaceful... It really was like a paradise. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

On one night of a full moon, Reisen received a transmission from other surviving [[Rabbit| moon rabbits]]. (Moon rabbits have some kind of telepathic ability and can communicate across great distances.) It said:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

"These filthy [[human]]s are exploiting the power of the moon and trying to build a base here. We've been urging them co-exist peacefully with us, but they never listen. We're up against a wall.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

"We've decided to declare a final war against them. The tide of war is currently slightly in their favour... Their modern weaponry is far better than we expected. But don't worry, we have the wisdom and pride of our millennia of history... We will never lose.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

"Dear Reisen, a war will be starting soon. Please come back and fight at our side.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

"Also, please tell the humans you're living with... That we're coming to take you back with us on the next full moon. Refusal is not an option."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Reisen told them that she needed to return to the moon, but... Kaguya and Eirin were part of the [[Lunarian]] race as well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Kaguya remembered her past. A past of innocence. A life of living with [[human]]s. A memory of murdering emissaries and going into hiding.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Kaguya had a discussion with Eirin, then decided to not return Reisen to the moon, which would result in killing the emissaries and relocated their home. Thus they would have to return to going into hiding again. However, Kaguya got sick and tired of doing such thing so she consult Eirin if there was a way to drive away the emissaries while being able to live on Earth with dignity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Just as Kaguya was about to finish speaking, Eirin presented her solution.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

"If we remove the full moon from Earth, then the path between Earth and the Moon will be closed. A full moon from Earth is what makes it possible for them to come here. That's why the [[Lunarian]]s only visit on nights with a full moon. If we corrupt that full moon... Earth will become a large, sealed chamber." &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Thus, they hid the true moon from Earth, replacing it with a fake moon that will never be full.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

It was no longer possible to travel between Earth and the [[Moon]].&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Their only mistake was that they had not expected the power of the youkai, who rely on the power of the full moon, to be this powerful.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

In the end, [[human]]s and [[youkai]] succeeded in dispelling the fake moon. But that wasn't a problem... Gensokyo was already sealed by the Hakurei border, so the [[Lunarian]]s wouldn't have been able to enter Gensokyo to begin with.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Kaguya, Eirin and Reisen have come out of hiding and are living freely in [[Eientei]].&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

So, what was the outcome of the Moon War? That didn't matter to Kaguya anymore; Gensokyo is now her home...

{{nihongo|'''Kana Anaberal'''|カナ・アナベラル|Kana anaberaru}} is a [[poltergeist]] produced by a mentally unstable girl. She has been haunting a certain mansion for a very long time now; with the people who live there no longer scared of her, she wanders over to the [[Probability Space Hypervessel]] during ''[[Phantasmagoria of Dim.Dream]]'' to participate in the battle.

==Character Design==
===Name===
Her name is {{nihongo|''Kana Anaberal''|カナ・アナベラル}}. [[ZUN]]'s comments suggest that Kana's name is a pun on Cape ''Canaveral''.&lt;ref&gt;'''[[Shuusou Gyoku]]''': {{lang|ja|創曲幻想}}.txt&lt;/ref&gt;

===Design===
Kana's design show that she wears a blue and white maid uniform with a frilled white apron, a red ribbon, and a wide-brim hat with a red ribbon on it. She has yellow eyes and blond hair. Her alternate outfit is the same, except her maid uniform is red instead of blue and both ribbons on her are violet.

==Appearances==
;''Phantasmagoria of Dim.Dream''
:{{Main|Phantasmagoria_of_Dim.Dream/Story#Kana_Anaberal.27s_Ending|l1=Phantasmagoria of Dim.Dream Story}}
In ''[[Phantasmagoria of Dim.Dream]]'', should Kana be the one to have her wish granted by [[Yumemi Okazaki]], she wishes to be reassigned to the [[Hakurei Shrine]] - as she is a poltergeist, she used to be forever linked to the old house. She goes there and begins trying to haunt [[Reimu Hakurei]].

==Additional Information==
*Kana appears on the cover of ''[[Phantasmagoria of Dim.Dream]]'', along with all the other characters in that game.
*She and [[Mugetsu]] bear a resemblance to each other.
*The [[Prismriver Sisters]] are, in a lot of ways, similar to her. Both haunt a mansion, both have little girls that created them that aren't around anymore and both are poltergeists.

{{nihongo|'''Kanako Yasaka'''|八坂　神奈子|Yasaka Kanako}} is the main antagonist of [[Mountain of Faith]]. She's the current goddess of the [[Moriya Shrine]] after defeating its previous resident goddess [[Suwako Moriya]] in the [[Gensokyo Timeline#Historical events|Great Suwa War]]. She desires to collect large amounts of faith, but since the humans of the [[Outside World]] no longer place much importance on gods, she has transported the shrine to [[Gensokyo]]. She currently lives on top of the [[Youkai Mountain]], where she has an uneasy relationship with the leaders of the [[tengu]].

==General Information==
Kanako first appeared as the Final boss of ''[[Mountain of Faith]]'', as well as being the Extra stage midboss. She was a target on stage 11 of ''[[Double Spoiler]]'', one of [[Sanae Kochiya]]'s [[spell card]]s in ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]'' and was shown in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]''. She was indirectly responsible for the events of ''[[Subterranean Animism]]'', ''[[Undefined Fantastic Object]]'', ''Touhou Hisoutensoku'' and ''[[Ten Desires]]''.

As the deity of the [[Moriya Shrine]], Kanako herself is considered a [[god]], but she also possesses a [[human]] form. She is considered to be a [[divine spirit]] in this respect. Though she is currently considered a goddess of wind and rain, she currently has plans under way to transition into a goddess of technological innovation, as divine spirits can apparently change their own natures by using myths.

===Personality===
Kanako is an ambitious woman who treats religion like a business, using whatever means bring her the most "profit" - that profit being instead faith. She has a natural presence that can seem intimidating or suspicious at times, but also reliable. Unusually for a god she has little respect for tradition - she demands little formality in her worship, and encourages scientific progress. It is somewhat strange for a deity to be knowledgeable and interested about science.

She has no hostility towards humans, though as is the case with all deities, she may curse them if they are disrespectful. She also seems to be rather short-tempered, but she is vulnerable to gifts.

===Abilities===
;Ability to create heavenliness
Kanako's ability specifically refers to the element of {{nihongo|Qian|乾}}, the "sky" of [[wikipedia:bagua|Bagua]] in [[Taoist]] philosophy. Qian is associated with creation, leadership, overtness, reliability, and acting first rather than reacting to others. [[Suwako Moriya]]'s ability to create {{nihongo|Kun|坤||earth}}, refers to the opposite element.

She is at least called "wind god", so it may be a power to manipulate wind, rain, and weather. For Kanako to be a [[god]] of agriculture, to manipulate the wind and rain and make the soil plentiful would definitely be the quickest and easiest way to quickly and easily gather faith.

In ''[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]]'', it's stated that this ability of hers is still very much a mystery. Concerning what kind of power this is, since there is nothing that seems like a portrayal of this, it is not definite, but it is probably a power unimaginable to humans. After all, perhaps wind god→climate→air=sky. She has been seen altering the terrain with Suwako's help, opening holes to the underground, and even creating large structures. She helped build the [[Myouren Temple]], as well.

===Occupation===
Kanako is currently the deity of the [[Moriya Shrine]], and lives with [[Suwako Moriya]], the de facto ruler of the shrine, and [[Sanae Kochiya]], a wind priestess. She generally seems to spend her time implementing new ways to gain faith from those who live outside the [[Youkai Mountain]].

===Possessions===
Kanako's [[Wikipedia:Shimenawa|shimenawa]] represents the figure of an entwined snake, which in turn represents resurrection, rebirth, and eternity through the repeated shedding of its own skin. She also possesses [[onbashira]], which she apparently uses in traditional festivals to toss off of cliffs.

==Backstory==
[[File:GoMIllus-Kanako.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Illustration of Kanako from ''[[Grimoire of Marisa]]'']]
One of the gods of Yamato (the precursor of the modern Japanese state), Kanako took over the kingdom ruled by the native goddess [[Suwako Moriya]] by holding out a thin vine that immediately rusted all of Suwako's iron weaponry. However, the inhabitants of Suwako's kingdom found it difficult to accept their new deity. In order to consolidate her newfound realm, she borrowed Suwako's powers. In reality, Suwako still ruled, while Kanako was their deity in name only.

However, as time went on humans eventually began to disbelieve in the concept of eternity, which Kanako in part represented. They grew stronger and invented ways of getting around the agricultural problems posed by harsh rain and wind. As their belief in science and information grew, their faith in gods like Kanako waned, and thus did her power.

In order to solve this problem, Kanako decided that the most appropriate course of action would be to abandon the [[outside world|human world]] and gather faith in [[Gensokyo]]. It ended up working out quite well, and she started to be worshipped as the deity of the [[Youkai Mountain]]. She then realized that, after observing the [[Hakurei Shrine]] which, though low on faith, was frequently visited by [[youkai]] was the main reason she had been accepted so quickly.

Kanako, however, did not forsee the power of those who lived on the mountain, such as the [[kappa]] and [[tengu]], growing greater through their worship of her. Worried about the power balance in Gensokyo, she resolved to rein in more believers from elsewhere, and thus decided to utilize the Hakurei Shrine for her own ends.

==Character Design==
[[File:ThGKKanako.png|thumb|right|175px|Kanako, as she appears in ''[[Symposium of Post-mysticism‎]]''.]]
===Origin===
Kanako is based off both [[wikipedia:Takeminakata|Takeminakata-no-Mikoto]] ({{nihongo|建御名方命}}) and Yasakatome-no-Mikoto ({{nihongo|八坂刀売命}}),&lt;ref&gt;[[Chara☆Mel/Mountain of Faith interview with ZUN]]&lt;/ref&gt; gods of the [[Wikipedia:Suwa Taisha|Suwa Grand Shrine]], which, on the other hand, [[Suwako Moriya]] is named after.
====Takeminakata====
Takeminakata, also known as ''Suwa Daimyōjin'' ({{nihongo|諏訪大明神}}) or ''Suwa Myōjin'' ({{nihongo|諏訪明神}}), is the god of wind, water, hunting, agriculture, and warfare worshiped in the Upper Shrine of Suwa ({{nihongo|上社}} ''Kamisha''), one of two sites that make up the Grand Shrine of Suwa. 

In the ''[[wikipedia:Kojiki|Kojiki]]'', Takeminakata was a son of [[Wikipedia:Ōkuninushi|Ōkuninushi]], ruler of the land of Izumo, who was defeated by the god of thunder, [[wikipedia:Takemikazuchi|Takemikazuchi]], acting as the messenger of the gods of heaven, and forced into exile in the "sea of Suwa in the land of Shinano." (Curiously, Takeminakata only appears in the ''Kojiki''; he is absent in other sources that tell the same myth, such as the ''[[wikipedia:Nihon Shoki|Nihon Shoki]]''; it is thus speculated that Takeminakata was not originally associated with Izumo and was only artificially grafted into this myth.)

In Suwa, however, Takeminakata, as Suwa Myōjin, is instead considered to be a deity who defeated a local god named [[wikipedia:Moreya|Moreya]] (a.k.a. Moriya, the god Suwako is based off) using only a branch or vine of wisteria. After his defeat, Moreya swore fealty to Takeminakata, the new ruler of the Suwa region, and became the ancestor of the Moriya clan ({{nihongo|守矢氏}}), one of the priestly families of the Upper Shrine of Suwa who served the shrine's high priest, the ''Ōhōri'' ({{nihongo|大祝}}), a young boy of the Suwa clan ({{nihongo|諏訪氏}}) considered to be [[Human#Living_Gods|a living god]] and an incarnation of Suwa Myōjin himself. The Suwa clan itself as a whole claimed Takeminakata to be their divine ancestor. These families served in Suwa Shrine until hereditary priesthood was abolished in the wake of the formation of State Shinto during the Meiji period.

The story of Takeminakata's defeat of Moreya is thought to be a mythicization of a historical event in which a group of outsiders settled in the Suwa region and came into conflict with the local inhabitants, who they eventually defeated and placed under their control. One theory places this event around the end of the [[wikipedia:Jōmon period|Jōmon period]] (c. 14,000–300 BCE), claiming that the myth is based on indigenous Jōmon hunter-gatherers opposing the arrival of agricultural [[wikipedia:Yayoi people|Yayoi tribes]] into Suwa. Another theory claims that the story may be inspired by an event during the end of the [[wikipedia:Kofun period|Kofun period]] (late 6th century) in which a clan affiliated with the expanding Yamato kingdom (the future Suwa clan) invaded Suwa and subjugated a local clan of priest-chieftains who controlled the area, what would become known as the Moriya clan. (Kanako's characterization as one of the "gods of Yamato" may be based on this latter theory.)

While the myth of Suwa Myōjin's entry into Suwa is the inspiration behind Kanako's backstory, ''[[Silent Sinner in Blue]]'' suggests that a god named 'Takeminakata', a son of Lord Daikoku (modeled after the ''Kojiki''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s portrayal of Takeminakata as Ōkuninushi's son) exists as a separate figure from Kanako.

====Yasakatome====
Yasakatome is the goddess of the Lower Shrine of Suwa ({{nihongo|下社}} ''Shimosha'') considered to be Takeminakata's spouse, and likely the basis for Kanako's last name. Unlike Takeminakata, very little myth or legend survives of her.

In one story involving the goddess, when Yasakatome left her husband's place and moved north of Lake Suwa, where the two shrines that make up the Lower Shrine currently stand, she took with her a wad of cotton soaked in hot water. Upon arriving in her new home, she dropped the cotton ball on the ground; hot spring water gushed out at the spot where the cotton fell. This is considered to be the mythical origin of the hot springs of the town of [[wikipedia:Shimosuwa, Nagano|Shimosuwa]]. (Yasakatome's association with hot springs could be an inspiration for Kanako's involvement in the events of ''Subterranean Animism''.)

Another legend claims that the [[wikipedia:Pressure ridge (ice)|pressure ridge]] that forms on the frozen surface of Lake Suwa during cold winters, the ''Omiwatari'' (御神渡り, 'the god's crossing'), is caused by Takeminakata crossing the lake to visit his wife on the other shore.

====Association with snakes====
Kanako's association with snakes comes from the fact that the god of Suwa Shrine was often associated with and even portrayed as taking the form of a snake or a dragon in many legends and folktales. For instance, during the [[wikipedia:Mongol invasions of Japan|Mongol invasions of Japan]] in the 13th century, Suwa Myōjin is said to have appeared as a giant snake in the sky who flew westward to assist the Japanese troops. In another well-known medieval tale, the god of Suwa Shrine's true identity is claimed to be that of a warrior named [[wikipedia:Kōga Saburō|Kōga Saburō]], who was transformed into a snake/dragon after a journey into the underworld.

The association of Suwa Myōjin with serpents is due to his nature as a god of water, snakes and dragons being associated with the element. One theory regarding the name 'Takeminakata' is that it is derived from ''Minakata'' (水潟, 水方 or 水県), a term denoting a body of water.

====Kanako's mirror====
Kanako's mirror may be a reference to the ''Masumi no Kagami'' ({{nihongo|真澄の鏡}} 'clear mirror'), a mirror said to have been owned by Suwa Myōjin himself. Other items supposedly brought by the god during his entry into Suwa include a bell called the ''Yasaka no Suzu'' ({{nihongo|八栄の鈴}} - the characters for ''yasaka'' are not the same as those in 'Yasakatome' or in Kanako's surname) and horse riding gear. Out of these, the ''Yasaka no Suzu'' is currently on display in the [https://goo.gl/maps/xhmT6JmKaVn Upper Shrine's Treasury].

===Name===
Her full name is {{nihongo|''Yasaka Kanako''|八坂 神奈子}}. The {{nihongo||八|ya}} in her surname means "eight" and {{nihongo||坂|Saka}} mean "hill". Literally translated, ''yasaka'' means "eight hills," but can also figuratively mean "countless hills." It's referenced that because of her name, she might be seen as a mountain god; but she is really a god of wind and rain. 

The {{nihongo|神|''kami'', ''ka(n)''}} in her first name means "[[god]]", while the final character {{nihongo||子|ko}}, "child" is a common suffix for Japanese female names. Her name as a whole may be inspired by the Japanese word for a sacred mountain, ''[http://eos.kokugakuin.ac.jp/modules/xwords/entry.php?entryID=254 kannabi]'' ('''神奈'''備).

In the character introduction image of ''[[Mountain of Faith]]'' (just when her theme starts, and her name and title is revealed), her name was incorrectly spelled as ''Yasama Kanako'', which the "sama" isn't a correct romaji for {{lang|ja|坂}}.

===Design===
Kanako has an elaborate red shirt with long white sleeves and a round mirror over the center of her chest. She wears a long black skirt with a red flower print hem. Has poofy intense blue hair and dark red eyes. Behind her is a large twisting rope circle [[Wikipedia:Shimenawa|shimenawa]] with [[Wikipedia:Shide (Shinto)|shide]].

==Appearances==
===Games===
;Mountain of Faith
[[File:Th10KanakoSprite.png|frame|Kanako's sprite in ''MoF'']]
In the main events of ''[[Mountain of Faith]]'', Kanako plots to take over the [[Hakurei Shrine]] and use it to collect more faith, to gain more power.

:{{Main|Mountain of Faith/Story/Reimu's Scenario#Stage 6|l1=Reimu Arc}}
Kanako offers to take Reimu and her shrine under her wing so that both would increase in followers and faith. Reimu refuses, on the grounds that she does not want Kanako interfering. Kanako then decides that Reimu is going to accept her help by force and a battle ensues. After she is defeated, she, Sanae, and a few other youkai visit the Hakurei Shrine, where Reimu vouches for them, telling [[Aya]] that they're not bad gods.

:{{Main|Mountain of Faith/Story/Marisa's Scenario#Stage 6|l1=Marisa Arc}}
Kanako gets called out by Marisa for causing strife among the residents of the mountain and the [[Hakurei Shrine]]. Kanako scoffs and tells Marisa that she has no need for people who will not give her faith. After Marisa defeats her, the magician creates a little shrine out in the middle of nowhere and, in passing, notes that she should put Kanako in it. It immediately becomes a branch shrine for Kanako, though when she appears, she isn't too happy about it.

;Subterranean Animism
Before the events of ''[[Subterranean Animism]]'', it is hinted that she was the one who granted [[Utsuho Reiuji]] her powers (by telling her that she could swallow a god, [[Yatagarasu]]) and inadvertently caused the events of the game.

:{{Main|Subterranean Animism/Translation/Reimu and Yukari's Extra|l1=Reimu &amp; Yukari Arc}}
While Kanako was out on a shopping trip, Suwako explains to the pair about Kanako's quest to find a new energy source as part of their Mountain Industrial Revolution project. Suwako had reservations about the project (such as safety concerns for the kappa they employed). Koishi also hoped to be granted power just as Kanako did for Utsuho in the form of love, but was rebuked by Reimu.

:{{Main|Subterranean Animism/Translation/Reimu and Suika's Extra|l1=Reimu &amp; Suika Arc}}
Kanako was out with Suwako and during that time Sanae explains to the duo why Kanako gave Utsuho her powers as a means to produce a new kind of energy in order to bring more followers to the shrine. Reimu realizes that her entire presence during the events of the game helped to advance Kanako's project.

:{{Main|Subterranean Animism/Translation/Reimu and Aya's Extra|l1=Reimu &amp; Aya Arc}}
Reimu realizes all the fighting she's done was the cause of Kanako and asks Suwako what she was up to. Suwako explains that Kanako was looking for a high temperature for their kappa workers and decided that the Temple of the High Spirits was a suitable location and gave Utsuho her power.

:{{Main|Subterranean Animism/Translation/Marisa and Alice's Extra|l1=Marisa &amp; Alice Arc}}
Kanako catches Marisa going through her house and gave her a scolding.

:{{Main|Subterranean Animism/Translation/Marisa and Patchouli's Extra|l1=Marisa &amp; Patchouli Arc}}
Sanae tells Marisa of Kanako's plans of a kappa industrial revolution to give her followers a higher standard of living.

:{{Main|Subterranean Animism/Translation/Marisa and Nitori's Extra|l1=Marisa &amp; Nitori Arc}}
Koishi wanted to receive powers from Kanako for her pets as she did for Utsuho, but Marisa informs her that she will only do things that aid in her plans.

;Undefined Fantastic Object
Kanako is indirectly involved in the incident for ''[[Undefined Fantastic Object]]'', where because she gave Utsuho her nuclear powers, this caused geysers. however, this also caused the [[Palanquin Ship]] to pop out of the ground, thus creating the scenario of the game.

;Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom
Kanako appears in both Sanae's Pointdevice/No-Death Clear ending and Sanae's Legacy Mode ending, making her the only character the protagonist meets in both of her endings in [[Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom]]. In Sanae's Pointdevice/No Death Clear ending, Kanako reads a report written by Sanae about what happened on her trip (the report only being 80% true). Afterwards, Kanako started talking about [[Sagume Kishin]]. Kanako thought that if she was the sagume, then the lunarians are akin to [[god]]s. Kanako did some deep thinking for a while before realizing that Sanae has basically prevented the second coming of the Divine Emperor and deserves to be praised. In Sanae's Legacy Mode ending, Kanako can be seen training Sanae to become more skilled at dodging danmaku by throwing various balls of different types at her.

===Spin-offs===
;[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]
[[File:Th123Kanako.png|frame|Kanako in ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]''.]]
In ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]'', Kanako was aiding [[Sanae Kochiya]] to attack her opponents. During Sanae's story, Suwako goes behind Kanako's back and helps the [[kappa]] build the [[Hisoutensoku]]. Afterwards, Kanako suggests that nuclear power is too much for it, and proposes heat or electricity as an alternative power source, but is assured that it only runs on steam. She immediately turns it into an advertising tool to gather more faith.

;''Double Spoiler''
In ''[[Double Spoiler]]'', Kanako appeared as a [[stage]] 11 target, where she uses a few [[spell card]]s and had [[Aya Shameimaru]] and [[Hatate Himekaidou]] take photos of her and her [[danmaku]].

;''Hopeless Masquerade''
[[File:Th135Kanako.png|frame|Kanako in ''HM'']]
Kanako made a background cameo appearance in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'' on the [[Genbu Ravine]] stage. She is seen sitting on a rock making some sort of laugh.

;''Impossible Spell Card''
:{{Main|Impossible Spell Card#Story|l1=Impossible Spell Card: Story}}
After apparently reading the newspaper by the [[tengu]] about a mischief-making [[amanojaku]], she becomes one of the many strong [[youkai]] and [[human]]s to try and stop [[Seija Kijin]] on day 9. She uses [[spell card]]s that are considered impossible to dodge.

;''Touhou Gouyoku Ibun''
:{{Main|Touhou Gouyoku Ibun/Story/Kanako's Scenario|l1=Gouyoku Ibun: Kanako's Scenario}}
Kanako came to the fusion reactor to check on the odd state of the fusion reactor and found crude oil flowing into it. She then investigates the source of the oil and met [[Yuuma Toutetsu]]. After the battle with Yuuma, she discusses about the oil eruption together with Suwako. Kanako figures that the oil eruptions are the result of the former Hell of Blood Pools being reawakened, but is unsure whether Yuuma was directly responsible for reawakening it, or merely came to take advantage of its reawakening. She then decides to create a dark contract with Yuuma to stop the oil eruptions by having her keep the oil from bubbling up to the surface, while any future leakages are incinerated in the reactor's furnace or personally dealt with by Kanako.

===Literature===
;[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]
Kanako and Suwako's "experiment" to produce nuclear energy using [[Utsuho Reiuji]] has only been creating energy inefficiently, so Sanae asks Reimu to help them out; the shrine maiden produces some palladium alloy, and Kanako hosts a public experiment, which ends in great success. Later on, Kanako orders the [[kappa]] to create a dam on a river on the [[Youkai Mountain]] for the purpose of gathering more faith.

;[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]]
Kanako is one of the main speakers at the symposium, along with [[Byakuren Hijiri]] and [[Toyosatomimi no Miko]]. During it, she explains the details of why she moved the [[Moriya Shrine]] into [[Gensokyo]].

==Relationships==
===Sanae Kochiya===
Sanae is a wind priestess that worships Kanako, and was part of the shrine's move to [[Gensokyo]]. Kanako mentioned in ''[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]]'' that Sanae herself can be referred to as one of the "[[god]]s" of the [[Moriya Shrine]].

===Suwako Moriya===
Kanako and Suwako are the opposing gods of Moriya Shrine, but their profiles state that they share quite a few common interests and are actually pretty good friends. They do argue a lot, though, and Kanako still wears the snake-representing [[Wikipedia:Shimenawa|shimenawa]] to boast about the fact that she beat her.

===Utsuho Reiuji===
Kanako is the one who originally gave Utsuho her powers for her own end. At the moment it seems she is keeping Utsuho working to produce nuclear energy underground in [[Former Hell]].

==Additional Information==
[[File:Suwa Taisha Shimosha Akimiya Kaguraden.jpg|200px|thumb|right|The ''Akimiya''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s ''kagura'' hall in [[wikipedia:Shimosuwa|Shimosuwa]], [[wikipedia:Nagano Prefecture|Nagano Prefecture]].]]
*The silhouette of Kanako occupies the front of ''[[Mountain of Faith]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s jewel case.
*It is revealed in chapter 19 of ''[[Silent Sinner in Blue]]'' that the [[Lunarians]] created and use [[shimenawa]] to seal away those that are a threat to them. Kanako's shimenawa at her back is confirmed to be the actual shimenawa in her ''[[Mountain of Faith]]'' profile. In addition, in Suwako's profile, it is stated that Kanako was one of several gods fighting to unify Japan, and it was implied in ''Silent Sinner in Blue'' that it was the Lunarians who were behind those wars (assuming taking away Lord Daikoku's (Ōkuninushi) lands referred to the actual time that happened in [[Shinto]] mythology by Amaterasu's family, whom are implied to be the [[Lunar Capital]]'s founders). The Lunarians are even said to have used shimenawa to seal another god - Ōkuninushi's son Takeminakata - at the Moriya Shrine. However, it is unknown if Kanako was connected to, in league with, or aware of any of this.
*The shrine pictured in the background image of Kanako's spell cards is the [[wikipedia:Kagura-den|''kagura'' hall]] of the Autumn Court ({{nihongo|秋宮}} ''Akimiya'') of the Lower Shrine ({{nihongo|下社}} ''Shimosha''), one of the four shrines that make up the Suwa Grand Shrine.
*Oddly, Kanako's sprite changes colors in rainbow order during the time between when her theme begins and when she starts to battle. It also happens to [[Yumeko]] in the [[PC-98]] era and [[Seiga Kaku]].

　○６面ボス　山坂と湖の権化&lt;br /&gt;
　　八坂　神奈子（やさか　かなこ）&lt;br /&gt;
　　Yasaka Kanako


　　種族：神様&lt;br /&gt;
　　能力：乾を創造する程度の能力

　　最近、妖怪の山に神社ごと引っ越してきた神様である。


　　八坂（無数の坂）という名前の通り、山の神様と言われているが、実際は風雨の神様であった。&lt;br /&gt;
　　雨や風を司るという事は、つまり農業の神として祀られていた。


　　山の神様として祀られる事になった経緯は非常に複雑であり、その真意を知っているのは神奈子と諏訪子の二人だけである。


　　神奈子のトレードマークである『しめ縄』は、蛇が絡まっている姿を表現している。脱皮を繰り返す蛇は、復活と再生、永遠を意味していた。


　　だが、人間は寿命を知り、永遠を信じなくなった。&lt;br /&gt;
　　農業も風雨に対抗する術を手に入れつつあった。&lt;br /&gt;
　　山は火山や地殻変動で出来る事を知った。山を越える危険も失われた。


　　そう、人間は科学と情報を信仰し始めたのだ。&lt;br /&gt;
　　それと共に、彼女ら神々に対する信仰心は失われつつあった。



　　彼女は、信仰心を取り戻す方法を模索していた。&lt;br /&gt;
　　そして大きな賭に出る事にした。&lt;br /&gt;
　　それは&lt;br /&gt;
　　　『神社を人間の世界から幻想の物とし、幻想郷で信仰を集める事』&lt;br /&gt;
　　だった。


　　現在残された信仰が全て失われ一時的に力を失うが、可能性はその方がある。滅び行く過去の栄光より、可能性ある未来を選んだのだ。



　　――そして、彼女の企みは成功したように見えた。&lt;br /&gt;
　　予想以上スムースに幻想郷で神社は受け入れられ、早くも妖怪の山の神様として祀られ始めている。


　　余りのスムースさに何度か疑問を持つ事もあったが、幻想郷の仕組みを見ていると、その理由が何となく判る気がする。


　　幻想郷には博麗神社という神社が存在していた。&lt;br /&gt;
　　そこの神社は、信仰心こそ殆ど失われていたが、妖怪達に人気がありいつも誰か入り浸っている妖怪がいると言われていた。


　　妖怪にとって神社は、恰好の遊び場となっていたのだろう。


　　神奈子は信仰の対象と共に、妖怪の遊び相手としても受け入れられた。&lt;br /&gt;
　　宴会も毎晩のように開かれた。


　　実は、神様は一緒に遊んでくれる事を望んでいるのである。お祭りとは人間と神が一緒に遊ぶ事だ。日常を忘れて一緒になって遊ぶ事で、神と人間や、人間同士の共同体としての連帯感を持たせる。人間が妖怪に置き換わっても一緒である。


　　まさしくそれは、神奈子が望んだ『信仰』の形であった。




　　しかし、神奈子が持つ幻想郷の知識は乏しい。


　　幻想郷の妖怪には幾つもの勢力がある事を知らない。にもかかわらず、山の妖怪達の信仰を集め、その代わりに大いなる神徳を与えた。&lt;br /&gt;
　　その事が、山の妖怪、つまり天狗や河童達の力が強くなり過ぎる事に気付いていなかったのだ。&lt;br /&gt;
　　その事で、平穏な幻想郷のパワーバランスを崩す恐れがあった。


　　神奈子は、幻想郷のバランスを取る為にこれから麓の妖怪や人間の信仰も得る必要があるだろう。


　　その為には、博麗神社を利用しなければ上手く事が進まない。&lt;br /&gt;
　　幻想郷で外の世界と同等の信仰を取り戻すには、まだまだ課題は残されたままである。

Kanako Yasaka

Species: God&lt;br /&gt;
Ability: Creating the heavenliness ({{nihongo|Qian|乾}})

The goddess who, together with her shrine, recently moved to the [[Youkai Mountain]].

Because of her name 'Yasaka' (countless hills), she has been called a god of the mountains, but in reality, she is a god of the wind and rain. As such, she has been worshiped as a goddess of agriculture.

The particulars of how she came to be worshiped as a god of the mountains are highly complicated. Only Kanako and [[Suwako Moriya|Suwako]] know the truth of the matter.

Kanako's trademark ''shimenawa'' rope represents a coiling snake. The snake's continual cycle of molting represents resurrection, rebirth and eternity.

However, as [[human]]s have come to grips with their mortality, they have come to no longer believe in eternity.&lt;br /&gt;
In agriculture, too have they gained the means to defy the wind and the rain.&lt;br /&gt;
They learned that mountains were created from volcanoes and changes in the earth's crust. They became able to cross mountains easily and without danger.

Indeed, humans had begun to believe in science and information, and their faith in gods like Kanako continued to wane.

Kanako searched for a way to regain faith.&lt;br /&gt;
And she came up with a big gamble.&lt;br /&gt;
And that was, "to make the shrine into a thing of fantasy in the world of humans, and collect faith in [[Gensokyo]]".

Although it would mean that she would lose all the faith she still had left currently and thus lose her power temporarily, this way held more potential. She chose a future with potential rather over the crumbling glories of the past.

--And so, her plans seemed to be successful.&lt;br /&gt;
The shrine was accepted into Gensokyo more smoothly than she had expected, and she quickly began to be worshiped as the deity of the Youkai Mountain.

Although she had her doubts now and again at the excessive smoothness, once she saw how Gensokyo worked, she believed she understood why things went so well.

In Gensokyo there was a shrine called the [[Hakurei Shrine]].&lt;br /&gt;
Although that shrine had almost completely lost all its faith, it was popular with [[youkai]] and it was said there was always some youkai frequenting it.

For the youkai, the shrine seemed to have become a suitable playground.

Along with becoming an object of worship, Kanako was also accepted as a playmate of the youkai.&lt;br /&gt;
Feasts were held almost every night.

Actually, to play together was what gods wished for. Festivals were venues for humans and gods to play together. By forgetting about everyday life and coming together to play, gods and humans gained the feeling of solidarity within a community. Even if the humans were exchanged for youkai, it was the same.

This was exactly the kind of faith Kanako was wishing for.


However, the knowledge Kanako held of Gensokyo was limited.

She didn't know that among the youkai of Gensokyo, there existed a number of powers. Nevertheless, she collected the faith of the mountain youkai, and attained great divine virtue. She did not realize that this meant that the power of the mountain youkai, in other words the [[tengu]] and the [[kappa]], were becoming too great.

With that, there was the fear that the power balance of tranquil Gensokyo would collapse.

Kanako thought that to keep Gensokyo's balance, she must now acquire the faith of the youkai and humans beneath the mountain.

To achieve that, she must utilize the Hakurei Shrine else things won't proceed smoothly. Much remained before she would be able to regain the same amount of faith she'd had in the outside world.

Kanako Yasaka and Suwako Moriya.&lt;br /&gt;
They are the gods that recently moved their shrine to the top of the Youkai Mountain.

They are the start of this story.

——The Kappas' Energy Revolution

The plan by this name has safely concluded its first phase and is on its way towards practical implementation.

The plan involved using the now-dormant [[Remains of Blazing Hell|Blazing Hell]] as a super-high temperature furnace in an attempt to tame a power that it is said the [[outside world]] won't attain for hundreds of years: nuclear fusion energy.

The first step was to find an exemplary hell raven.&lt;br /&gt;
Then, to bestow upon it the personification of the sun, Yatagarasu.&lt;br /&gt;
Then, to rekindle the flames of the Remains of Blazing Hell.&lt;br /&gt;
Then, to tame the crow.

The geyser was proof of the plan's success.

Unlike fission energy, fusion reactions are less likely to go out of control. In addition, it doesn't create such lethal waste.&lt;br /&gt;
So, because it is very safe and produces massive amounts of energy, it is an almost dream-like energy production method.

Kanako seems to treat this as just one part of the shrine's operations.

Because they didn't feel the plan was dangerous, the above-ground [[youkai]] did nothing to stop it even once they found out the truth.

However, Reimu, who was made to go underground,&lt;br /&gt;
confronted them and said angrily,&lt;br /&gt;
"Next time, tell everyone about it before you start!"

{{nihongo|'''Kasen Ibaraki'''|茨木 華扇|Ibaraki Kasen}}, who also goes by the pseudonym '''Ibarakasen''' (茨華仙) or just '''Kasen''' (華仙), is the main protagonist of ''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]''. She is a mysterious self-proclaimed [[hermit]] living in the mountains. Possessing an artificial arm and various special abilities, she can often be seen dispensing knowledge to [[Reimu Hakurei]], [[Marisa Kirisame]], [[Sanae Kochiya]] and others. 

Kasen is also a [[Sages|Sage of Gensokyo]] and, as of ''Wild and Horned Hermit'' Chapter 49 Part 2, is confirmed to be an [[oni]] and one of the [[Big Four of the Mountain]]. 
==General Information==
Kasen has appeared as the main protagonist in ''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'' and has appeared in Chapter 16 and 17 of ''[[Oriental Sacred Place]]''. She also appears as a playable character in ''[[Urban Legend in Limbo]]'', and ''[[Antinomy of Common Flowers]]''.

===Personality===
Kasen is kind and polite to nearly everyone. She is always willing to lend a word of advice or teach a lesson, but is often seen as preachy and overly critical of others.

===Abilities===
Kasen spoke vaguely when informing [[Reimu Hakurei]] about her capabilities, saying her powers were a "secret"&lt;ref&gt;[[Wild and Horned Hermit|Wild and Horned Hermit - Chapter 1]]&lt;/ref&gt; and that she could do "various things". Because captions and the in-character setting have never directly explained this topic, what specific ability she possesses is unclear. Although several of her feats that can be seen as ability-like, it's not definite whether the following traits are because of an "ability to &lt;do something&gt;", are an innate ability of her race, or are examples of the kind of [[hermit]] sorcery mentioned in ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]''.

;Guiding of animals
Kasen is able to communicate with animals, including [[cryptid]]s, [[beast youkai]] and [[Dragon (species)|dragons]], and possesses a great deal of knowledge about them. She knows the antidotes to obscure venoms, as well as the processes that lead an animal to become various types of youkai and how to affect them. She also employs a number of trained animals as servants, whom she can apparently summon to her side. In addition to regular animals like monkeys, snakes and birds, Kasen and Reimu rode on the back of the [[Unnamed Dapeng]], and she is even able to use such uncommon creatures like the children of dragons. Especially concerning the children of dragons, she even said, "whatever I say, they will listen"&lt;ref&gt;[[Wild and Horned Hermit|Wild and Horned Hermit - Chapter 5]]&lt;/ref&gt;. According to Komachi, the employment of animals is Kasen's signature move.

On the official site, it was stated that she possessed the ability to guide animals, but since it was not stated as "ability to guiding animals", it is probably not an ability name.

;Artificial arm
Kasen's bandaged right arm is secretly an artificial one, apparently consisting of vaporous black smoke, and Kasen is capable of remotely controlling it and detaching it to act independently. Her arm is also capable of crushing [[vengeful spirit]]s&lt;ref&gt;[[Wild and Horned Hermit|Wild and Horned Hermit - Chapter 3]]&lt;/ref&gt;, removing them from the cycle of reincarnation entirely; [[Komachi Onozuka]] appears unsure how exactly Kasen does this. Of note, her arm is blown apart when it touches the Hakurei [[Yin-Yang Orb]], implying that it has [[youkai]] properties. Consequently, Kasen immediately reconstructed her annihilated right arm. As the yin-yang orb is the [[wikipedia:Shintai|shintai]] of the shrine blessed with exterminating [[youkai]], it is likely that Kasen's arm was made from some sort of youkai essence. When she had the artificial arm, she needed to drink from the [[Ibaraki Box of a Hundred Medicines]] regularly so the arm will not rot.  In ''[[Urban Legend in Limbo]]'' and ''[[Antinomy of Common Flowers]]'', Kasen's artificial right arm contorts and uses the smoke within to attack. 

;To guide and transfigure youkai
It was shown in chapter 16 of ''[[Oriental Sacred Place]]'' that she herself said that she admonished the [[Unnamed Okuri-inu|yamainu]] who attacked [[human]]s and turned them into [[youkai]], gave a recommendation to be a youkai whose stomach is satisfied even without attacking humans, and transfigured the human-protecting youkai into an okuri-inu. Afterwards, the yamainu, who was actually transfigured into a protective dog, in order to protect humans, drove away the [[Three Fairies of Light]] who were scheming mischief.

When Kasen said that she did something to the yamainu and hoisted her bandaged right arm in a meaningful manner, even [[Luna Child]] felt a sense of doubt that a human-eating beast would listen to preaching, so therefore it's probably not simply due to preaching, but a kind of ability. Of course, this could possibly just be a part of her ability to use animals.

;To hide her home using [[wikipedia:Fangshi|fangshu]]
This ability Kasen uses is probably only one aspect of fangshu (方書), it's unknown whether she's skilled in the other parts of the art. One must use this sorcery reach Kasen's hidden house, as it is only accessible through a special path opened by fangshu. Even when a blizzard occurs outside, the area around her house was in a clearing. Marisa remarked that it looks as of it were in another world or different plane.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wild and Horned Hermit|Wild and Horned Hermit - Chapter 10]]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the incident in ''[[Ten Desires]]'', [[Toyosatomimi no Miko]] and [[Mononobe no Futo]] created another world called [[Senkai]] and moved there, but it is not known whether or not the sorcery that Kasen used to hide her home and the sorcery used to create Senkai are of the same kind.

;Miscellaneous
*'''[[Hermit]] arts''': While she may or may not be a real hermit, Kasen has used the common hermit technique of hiding her dwelling place, preventing anyone from reaching it unless they follow a specific (regularly changed) route.
**According to something Reimu said in the first chapter and ''Perfect Memento in Strict Sense'', appearance-wise hermits look like aged. Among this, as Kasen has a juvenile appearance; this is the basis that her existence is different from that of an ordinary hermit. However, in ''[[Ten Desires]]'', the young-appearing hermit [[Seiga Kaku]] appeared, indicating that not all hermits have to look aged.
*'''Creating light orbs''': In chapter 10 of ''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'' Kasen creates orbs of light from her right hand that last for a long time move them by mere thought. This appears to be a generic application of mystic power, rather than a specific ability of Kasen's. Since she can freely use light orbs of the size and number she wants, it an be seen that she used a massive quantity of small ones as well as single big ones.
*'''Instant movement''': In the second chapter, she appeared in the background of the offertory box in the Hakurei Shrine without warning, surprising [[Sanae Kochiya]] who came to visit. It has not been specified what range of distance she is able to move, or if she can move anywhere. Also, in the seventh chapter, she performed a movement such that she was in the background of the offertory box without being noticed.
*'''The Hakurei Barrier'''  Kasen is capable of creating openings in the barrier to and from the outside world, which she does repeatedly in [[Urban Legend in Limbo]] as well as "off-panel" a few times in ''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]''. Notably, in Marisa's storyline in Urban Legend in Limbo, her incantation for opening it up is "In the name of the Sage XXXX, I command: Release the ban of 130 years!" This possibly was a foreshadowing to the reveal of her position in ''Wild and Horned Hermit'' Chapter 35.
*'''Her true strength''': In ''[[Urban Legend in Limbo]]'', after fighting Reimu, she said to herself that using her full strength, in that case, would be risky for "various reasons". It's unknown if this means that it could be dangerous doing it near the shrine (because of the Barrier) or against Reimu, or if it would be risky for ''herself'' since she is probably just pretending to be a hermit without being one.

===Possessions===
Kasen owns the [[Ibaraki Box of a Hundred Medicines]], which can cure all illnesses or heal any injury to the person who drinks from it.

===Species===
[[File:OniKasen.png|thumb|150px|Kasen's true form in ''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'' Chapter 49]]
In chapter 49 of the final WaHH arc, Kasen fuses with her separated arm, thus confirming once and for all her true name and title: '''Kasen Ibaraki - Wile, Cunning/Crafty and Treacherous Oni'''. However, the exact relationship between her status as an oni and her status as a [[hermit]] is not clear. She may very well be an oni who really decided to try to become a hermit. Yet there is no evidence ruling out the possibility that she is simply an oni who knows hermit techniques. The finale of WaHH states that Kasen truly does seek to follow the path of the hermit.
; Food
According to ''Perfect Memento in Strict Sense'', pretty much all hermits who have passed five hundred years of age don't need food, and simply ingesting fog or haze will be enough. However, Kasen not only eats food ordinarily but also seems to have a sweet tooth. She is frequently shown eating sweets in ''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'' and ''[[Urban Legend in Limbo]]''. She proposed having hot pot in chapter 2 and ate dango in chapter 7 of ''Wild and Horned Hermit''. Also, in chapter 10, when the stranded [[Marisa Kirisame]] strayed into her home, Kasen treated her to something like [[wikipedia:Nikuman|nikuman]], suggesting that Kasen normally keeps a supply of food in her home. Even supposing she hasn't reached five hundred years of age, this can be said to be a non-hermit-like trait.

==Backstory==
Kasen is one of the [[Sages|Sages of Gensokyo]] and was one of the now disbanded [[Big Four of the Mountain]]. 

Little else is known about any other details of Kasen's history so far. However, a [[Symposium of Post-mysticism/Bunbunmaru_Newspaper_13|newspaper article]] in ''[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]]'' reveals that she has been known as a hermit at [[Youkai Mountain]] since at least 1980, if not earlier.

Unknown to the public, long ago in the past she was actually a wicked oni. However, all her malevolence was contained in her right arm before it was cut off and sealed by [[Onikirimaru]], and Kasen's arm was replaced with an artificial one. When the seal on the wicked arm finally began to weaken, Kasen found herself at a decisive crossroads. Thus, she travelled down the mountain to see the shrine maiden.

==Character Design==
[[File:ThGK Bunbunmaru13.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Kasen makes an appearance in ''[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]].'']]

===Origin===
Kasen is based on the [[oni]] [[wikipedia:Ibaraki-dōji|Ibaraki-douji]]. Ibaraki-douji was one of the oni who ran the oni headquarters on Mt. Ooe and broke into Kyoto on a rampage. Although Ibaraki-douji is most commonly portrayed as a subordinate to [[wikipedia:ja:酒呑童子|Shuten-douji]] (who [[Suika Ibuki]] is based on), there are also variations to the myth where she is the daughter of Shuten-douji, or even his lover (being the only female oni of the group).

While Shuten-douji's gang was being massacred by [[wikipedia:Minamoto no Yorimitsu|Minamoto no Yorimitsu]], Ibaraki-douji fought with one of his allies, [[wikipedia:Watanabe no Tsuna|Watanabe no Tsuna]], but fled when she saw Shuten-douji fall in battle. 

The survivor Ibaraki-douji assailed humans once again afterwards, and in doing so, even assailed Watanabe no Tsuna. However, Tsuna was able to cut off Ibaraki-douji's arm, sending the oni running away once again. This is the likely basis for Kasen (formerly) missing her right arm.

===Name===
Although she introduces herself in ''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'' as {{nihongo|''Ibarakasen''|茨華仙}}, or  {{nihongo|''Kasen''|華仙}} for short, this is merely her [[wikipedia:Art name|pseudonym]]. Her real name is {{nihongo|''Kasen Ibaraki''|茨木 華扇|Ibaraki Kasen}}&lt;ref name="ibarakasen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ichijinsha.co.jp/special/toho_ibarakasen/|title=キャラクター紹介|publisher=[[Ichijinsha]]}}, year:2011&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oriental Sacred Place]]'' Chapter 16&lt;/ref&gt;; note the different spellings of "Kasen". Her surname, {{nihongo|Ibaraki|茨木}} comes from Ibaraki-douji and means "thorn bush" (rose bush), while {{nihongo|Kasen|華扇}} is a real, commonly used Japanese name written with the characters for "flower" and "fan".

Her hermit name, {{nihongo|茨華仙||Ibarakasen}} translates to "rose-flower hermit" and is often just shortened to 華仙 (Kasen lit. "flower hermit", a homophone of her actual name, 華扇 Kasen lit. "flower fan"). "Kasen" is also homophonous with the first two characters in 何仙姑 ([[wikipedia:He_Xiangu|He Xiangu]], JP: Kasenko), the only female member of the [[wikipedia:Eight Immortals|Eight Immortals]] of [[Taoist]] mythology. Xiangu owns a [[wikipedia:fenghuang|fenghuang]], making it likely to be the basis of Kasen's affinity with animals. The name "Kasen" (何仙) also appears in the Japanese detective novel series, ''塗仏の宴 宴の支度'' (Nuribotoke no Utage, Utage no Shitaku lit. "[[wikipedia:Nuribotoke|Nuribotoke's]] Banquet, Banquet in Preparation"). It's plausible that ZUN, as a lover of mystery novels, may have taken inspiration from there.

; Kasen's Title 
The "horned" in her title was long since speculated to be related to her hair buns possibly hiding horns of some sort. As of ''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'' Chapter 49 Part 2, Kasen rejoined with her actual right arm and returned to her true form as an [[oni]]. As a part of this transformation, actual horns burst from the buns on her head, destroying the headwear in the process. After having her arm cut off and resealed, Kasen's horns are shown to be visibly smaller.&lt;ref name=wahh50"&gt;[[Wild and Horned Hermit]] - Chapter 50&lt;/ref&gt;

===Design===
[[File:OSPKasen.png|thumb|150px|Kasen Ibaraki in ''[[Oriental Sacred Place]]'' Chapter 16]]
In her original appearance, she has red eyes and shoulder-length pink hair with Chinese-styled buns. Her right arm is wrapped in bandages, concealing a gaseous black smoke. She wears a white top and a green skirt. Over her top is a maroon tabard with a thorny vine motif and large rose-shaped ornament just below collar level. Her single-strap shoes are colored the same as her tabard, and a shackle lays on her left wrist.

Her [[Ibaraki-douji's Arm|severed arm]] is generally the same in terms of design, with the only notable differences being the presence of horns, fangs, slit-pupil eyes, claw-like nails and sharper hair. The tabard and skirt she wears is colored different from Kasen's, being two seperate shades of blue. Shackles are present on all four of her limbs, with her leg shackles having iron ball-and-chains attached to them.

Kasen's true form, with her right arm reconnected to her body, has her gain horns were her buns previously were and grow knee-length hair. Both her tabard, now black and golden, and her skirt, now white, are noticeably longer, and her top becomes sleeveless. She retains her shackles on all four limbs, with iron bearings attached to all of them and her slit-eyed pupils.

===Literature===
[[File:WaHH3 Kasen.png|thumb|200px|Kasen from ''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'']]
;''Wild and Horned Hermit''
:{{Main|Wild and Horned Hermit}}
Kasen meets [[Marisa Kirisame]] outside the [[Human Village]] as the latter was running an errand for [[Reimu Hakurei]]. In the beginning, she appears to be nothing but a simple, strange ascetic, but it's all a guise. Her real motive for appearing at the [[Hakurei Shrine]] is to search for the [[Kappa]]'s Arm she believes resides there. She also claims her objective is to shut down the connection between [[human]]s and the [[Former Hell]]. What that means is unclear, but she takes great interest in the runaway [[vengeful spirit]]s at the [[Underground Geyser Center]], and is able to destroy them with her bandaged smoke arm. This brings her to the attention of [[Komachi Onozuka]], whose superiors are concerned about Kasen's movements. As she continues to act in secret, she also attempts to teach Reimu, [[Sanae Kochiya]], and Marisa how to be better people, investigates and wraps herself up in various small time incidents, and introduces Reimu and the others to her power to control various [[beast]]s.

Over the course of the story, Kasen becomes involved in cases relating to [[Sumireko Usami]]'s entry and exit from Gensokyo and the effects this has on the [[Great Hakurei Barrier]]. This leads her to attract the attention of her old acquaintance [[Yukari Yakumo]], who seems interested in Kasen's actions and reveals her nature as one of the [[Sages of Gensokyo]]. Although Yukari's exact goal is unclear, she chastises Kasen's for disrupting things with her actions - for example, by accidentally allowing invasive western dandelions to enter the barrier. Yukari implies that Kasen is somehow guiding Sumireko's manifestations, which Kasen quickly denies. Kasen also draws the attention of [[Mamizou Futatsuiwa]], who quickly determines she is an Oni with some sort of plot relating to the Hakurei Shrine. Mamizou attempts to intimidate her so she can continue with her own plans for the shrine, but ends up being tricked by Kasen at a drinking challenge and admits defeat. 

Near the end of the series, Reimu comes down with a strange sickness that renders her seemingly healthy but utterly comatose. Unbeknownst to her friends, this is due to her discovery of Kasen's sealed missing arm, which Kasen recovered long ago from the outside world and kept for safekeeping. Confronted by the arm, Reimu's soul ends up trapped in the Infinite Hell of Avici. Unexpectedly, though, Kasen brings Reimu's body to the hell, allowing her to escape from what would otherwise be an infinite prison. In doing so, Reimu discovers the true nature of Kasen's missing arm - that it is a piece of a very powerful Oni and can manifest in humanoid form. They battle, but Reimu seems outmatched by the hand's sheer viciousness and power. Just when it seems she is going to be defeated, Kasen interrupts the fight and fuses with her arm. The combined being offers food, leading Reimu to hope that she has been saved by the "Good Kasen", but it turns out that Kasen merely wanted her to be a fitting challenge as the battle resumes.

Although the fused Kasen seems invincible, she appears to be holding back for some reason. With the help of [[Tenshi Hinanawi]], who came to the Hell while investigating Reimu's disappearance after realizing that Kasen was related to the case, Reimu realizes that Kasen has smuggled her something in the food: A piece of [[Onikirimaru]], the oni-slaying sword that sealed Kasen away long ago. Realizing that Kasen's parts are working against each other, Reimu becomes determined to win the fight. Although she doesn't fully understand the situation, Reimu uses the sword fragment to empower her [[Fantasy Seal]] and cut off Kasen's arm once more.

It turns out that Kasen's actions the entire time were all a means of finding someone to help reseal her arm, since it could not be destroyed. As all of Kasen's malice was sealed into it at the moment of severing, Kasen felt a responsibility to keep it contained. She had found her it enshrined in the Outside World long before the events of the manga and realized that it was breaking free of its bonds, becoming a threat to those around it. In search of a way to repair the seal, Kasen eventually decided to get closer to the arguable best user of seals in Gensokyo - Reimu. Thus several earlier incidents where Kasen advised Reimu or subjected her to harsh training finally make sense, as they are all revealed to have been attempts to prepare her for the eventual battle with the arm. With the arm sealed again for now, Kasen seems content to continue living in the role she created in Gensokyo.

;''Oriental Sacred Place''

In chapter 16, Kasen goes to the Hakurei Shrine to tell Reimu about rumors about a wolf on the foot of the Youkai Mountain. Later, she meets the fairies trying to catch the wolf, and tells them how it was just a regular dog and how she ended up persuading it. Although Kasen said to the fairies that she warned the dog and tell it to protect humans from youkai, they didn't know what that meant until they tried to enter the [[Human Village]] to prank the villager as always, as they got chased by it due to not being human.

In chapter 17, Kasen goes again to the Shrine and scolds Reimu for not even knowing the [[Hakurei God]]'s blessing. That's when the [[Three Fairies of Light]] appeared to help, so Kasen suggests searching for the goshintai of the god, as the god could manifest their powers better thanks to it. After the fairies start the search, she leaves. In the forest, Kasen finds them and a [[Yin-Yang Orb]], which vaporizes her bandaged arm when she tries to grab it. While she commands to one of her animals to deliver it back to the shrine, she thinks about how youkai extermination can be the god's blessing, and how slightly ironic it is for a person like Reimu.

===Spin-offs===
;''Urban Legend in Limbo''
Kasen's first in-game appearance is in the fighting game ''[[Urban Legend in Limbo]]''.

In [[Sumireko]]’s scenario, she tries to scare her away to make her leave Gensokyo, fearing that if something happens to the human an investigation in the Outside world could lead to the discovery of Gensokyo.

In Mamizou’s scenario, the tanuki will claim that she understood her plan and she offers herself as if she is spotted nothing will happen, unlike Kasen.

In her scenario, she recollects the Occult balls from all the characters she finds to prevent them from gathering seven and open holes in the barrier. Finally, she finds [[Sumireko Usami|the culprit]], who explains how she got the balls and her plans. Later, the human attacks her and manages to flee.

In [[Reimu]]’s ending, she, Mamizou, Reimu and [[Marisa Kirisame]] consider what to do with Sumireko. They decide to bring her back to the Outside World and watch for her, but Sumireko comes back saying she can visit Gensokyo in her dreams.  

;''Antinomy of Common Flowers''
In ''[[Antinomy of Common Flowers]]'', Kasen partners with [[Reimu Hakurei]] to begin investigating the Perfect Posession incident. While she begins as the slave, Reimu learns she will need to become the slave, crucial to [[Yukari Yakumo]]'s plan, so Kasen becomes Reimu's master.

Later, Kasen's [[Dream World]] self begins to rampage with the other dream dwellers, whom [[Joon Yorigami|Joon]] and [[Shion Yorigami]] must stop. Dream Kasen offers to let the sisters join the dream dwellers and to rise in power, but Joon declines, claiming that her training at [[Myouren Temple]] changed her.

==Relationships==
===Reimu Hakurei===
Kasen remembers [[Reimu Hakurei]] from long before, having visited the [[Hakurei Shrine]] many times in the past, although Reimu's memory failed her and she had to be reminded who Kasen was. She's mostly earned Reimu's annoyance, who dislikes sermons and doesn't want her shrine to smell of them. She mostly thinks of Kasen as a nagging, preachy busybody. However, Reimu often concedes, either because Kasen is usually right or she doesn't want to deal with her. Kasen is openly critical of Reimu, believing her to be too greedy and slack in her duties.

In truth, Kasen was mentoring and training Reimu specifically so that Reimu could be strong and wise enough to seal away Kasen's wicked arm some day. However, it appears that her fondness of Reimu grew beyond that purpose, as during Reimu's climactic battle with her arm, Kasen smiles wistfully thinking that she must train Reimu further even as Reimu failed to take advantage of Kasen's aid.

Reimu too has begun to view Kasen as a genuine friend, unable to bring herself to fight Kasen whole-heartedly until she realizes that the arm battling her is actually a separate entity from Kasen. When she sees that Kasen survived the battle, Reimu expresses relief.

By the end of things, Reimu knows that Kasen is secretly an oni, but partially due to this friendship and partially due to owing Kasen for all the money that one of Kasen's schemes got her, Reimu can't tell anyone else about it.

===Marisa Kirisame===
Initially thinking she was just a strange hermit, [[Marisa Kirisame]] also met Kasen some time before ''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'' and is the first to remember who she was. Once reunited, Kasen is invited by Marisa to visit more often, to the disdain of Reimu. Marisa hopes that Kasen will teach her any life extending techniques and is more than willing to listen to Kasen's preaching in exchange.

===Kasen's Pets===
Kasen's pets include [[Koutei]], [[Kume]], [[Mukou]], Saouchi, [[Kanda]], and [[Houso]]. They're mostly [[cryptid]]s who can be summoned at any time, such as when she called on the child dragon to abduct Reimu and used the dapeng for transportation. However, there was a point at which the raijuu she captured previously felt lonesome and ran away. She is also shown to have a snake and monkey.

===Ibaraki-douji's Arm===
This is Kasen's right arm, cut off with the use of Onikirimaru long ago after all Kasen's malevolence was moved to it. Ibaraki's arm is sentient and has a mind of her own to the point where she can be considered a separate entity of sorts even after the two are re-combined. She even managed to forcefully take control of Kasen's entire body after she realized Kasen's true intentions. Initially Kasen was overjoyed to be re-united with it. However, this was a front, as Kasen actually wished that her malevolence and her arm remain sealed away. Upon realizing this, Ibaraki's Arm forcefully took control of Kasen's entire body before Reimu managed to cut off and seal her again. Kasen currently keeps the arm physically near by in mummified-arm form as a trophy of sorts as well as a reminder, comparing it to being able to see your own death close by.

===Sages of Gensokyo===
;[[Yukari Yakumo]]
It is unknown how long Yukari and Kasen have known each other, but both are youkai sages.  The monologue in [[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]] states it was the youkai sages who proposed the Hakurei Barrier, so Yukari and Kasen probably knew each other since at least that time.

After Kasen came down from the mountain in the present day, Yukari assumed Kasen was always "on her side" and that Kasen's actions were intended to help Yukari's ideals. Kasen finally got fed up by the time of Wild and Horned Hermit Chapter 35 and angrily informed Yukari that she wasn't on her side. This caused Yukari a brief visible moment of distress before she regained her composure, but she also stated she would wait as long as it takes for Kasen to come to her side.

Kasen's dream self in [[Antinomy of Common Flowers]] calls Yukari a coward who gets others to do her work for her because she's too scared to do it herself.  As dream selves are unrestrained exaggerations of the real being, it is uncertain how much of this reflects Kasen's actual view of Yukari, but from Doremy's explanation of dream selves in Reisen's scenario, it does mean Kasen's normal feelings fall along those lines at least somewhat.

;[[Okina Matara]]
Kasen has known Okina since a while back as a fellow sage, and commented how it was a misfortune getting to know her. She also claims to know how Okina works and acts around others, but any actual interaction has not been shown.

===Minor Relationships===
{{stub|section}}
;[[Sanae Kochiya]]
Sanae Kochiya lives on the [[Youkai Mountain]] near to Kasen and are considered neighbors. They meet fairly often and are on friendly enough terms. Kasen is a bit critical of Sanae as well, albeit to a much lesser extent than Reimu. Sanae describes her as living in a large mansion, corrected by Kasen as being a training dojo.

;[[Kanako Yasaka]] and [[Suwako Moriya]]
Despite being friendly enough with Sanae, she is highly suspicious of Kanako and Suwako's schemes to attain faith and their inability to handle the [[Underground Geyser Center]]'s dangers.

;[[Komachi Onozuka]]
Komachi Onozuka and Kasen are slightly antagonistic toward each other. Ordered to keep Kasen under surveillance, Komachi is distrusting of her, even to the point of threatening her with her scythe – although the death god doesn't appear to be serious about it.

;[[Suika Ibuki]] and [[Yuugi Hoshiguma]]
When Suika Ibuki appeared at the Hakurei Shrine, Kasen quickly fled the scene in order to avoid her. She appears familiar with Suika, but her relationship with her is unknown, and she appears hesitant about letting Suika know about her current status. However, after learning that Kasen borrowed some sake from Yuugi, Suika realised that Kasen was planning something and decided to leave her alone. She also knows Kasen's true form.

;[[Sumireko Usami]]
Kasen appears to meet with Sumireko in [[Rinnosuke Morichika]]'s shop several times over the course of [[Wild and Horned Hermit]], including claiming that she's the secret supply chain Kasen utilizes to get goods from outside the barrier. Given that Kasen possesses her own ability to circumvent it, it is uncertain how much of their relationship is really related to transferring things into Gensokyo and how much this is a useful excuse for her abilities.

==Additional Information==
*Kasen was one of the possibilities [[ZUN]] had in mind for the Extra Stage boss of ''[[Ten Desires]]'', along with [[Byakuren Hijiri]]. [[Mamizou Futatsuiwa]] took that place.
*Kasen is mentioned in ''[[Ten Desires]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; ending no.4, where it's explaining that Marisa heard from Kasen that the ultimate goal of [[Taoism]] is to achieve immortality.
*Kasen's title of {{Nihongo|"The One-armed Horned Hermit"|片腕有角の仙人}} appears to be derived from the titular character of the Noh play {{Nihongo|"One-horned Hermit"|一角仙人|Ikkaku Sennin}}.
*From a historical perspective, the Noh play suggests that Kasen may not exactly be a hermit, but a [[wikipedia:rishi|rishi]], a person who gives wisdom. They are different from hermits in that they are sometimes regarded as ''[[Buddhism|Buddhist]] saints''.
*Kasen recites a fragment from one of Miyako no Yoshika's poems in her first appearance. The poem in question is said to have been a collaboration with Ibaraki-Douji, and the fragment that Kasen recites is Ibaraki's half of the poem. The folktale goes that Yoshika was traveling through the Rajoumon gate one night and was struck with inspiration upon seeing the scenery. He composed the first half of the poem on the spot, and when he spoke it aloud, a voice from the gatehouse replied with the second half. Ibaraki-Douji was said to dwell in the gatehouse on Rajoumon's second floor, and furthermore, when Yoshika proudly presented the collaboration to Sugawara no Michizane, Michizane was immediately certain that the anonymous author must have been an oni (some earlier versions of the story have Yoshika composing the whole poem, while Ibaraki is moved by his skilful words and calls out "Touching, touching!" to convey its admiration). &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mori |first1=Masato |date=1982 |title=Konjaku Monogatari-shū |url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/30233945 |journal=Japanese Journal of Religious Studies |volume=9 |issue=2/3 |pages= 151-152 |access-date=September 7, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Kasen is one of the few print work-débuted characters to become a major character in a game. Some others are [[Aya Shameimaru]] and the [[Three Fairies of Light]].

{{nihongo|'''Keiki Haniyasushin'''|埴安神 袿姫|Haniyasushin Keiki}} is a god summoned by human spirits and acts as the main antagonist of ''[[Wily Beast and Weakest Creature]]''.

==General Information==

Keiki debuts as the final boss in ''[[Wily Beast and Weakest Creature]]'', acting as a force of opposition to the animal spirits possessing the protagonists. 

===Personality===

Keiki is quite polite and doesn't fight if she can avoid it, but this attitude presented seems to mostly extend to only humans. On one hand, at first, she tries to convince the protagonist that fighting her would be against their interests. On the other hand, she also boasts of thinking no one was left to defeat her in battle and is quick to engage the possessed protagonist once finding out about the animal spirit's plan to invade and relinquish her control over the [[Primate Spirit Garden]]. However, despite her intention to liberate the human spirits and act as a venerable force, she still expresses that she was planning to cooperate with the animal spirits in a conversation with [[Yachie]], suggesting more reasonable intent, which Yachie subsequently rejects. &lt;ref name="KY"&gt; ''[[Wily Beast and Weakest Creature]]'' - Youmu (Otter) Ending &lt;/ref&gt;

===Abilities=== 
;Ability to create idols

She can craft idols, which are animated by faith directed into them. It seems that's not their only objective, as they can act as stand-ins, play with you, or decorate your home. &lt;ref name="WBaWCP"&gt; ''[[Wily Beast and Weakest Creature]]'' - Keiki's Profile &lt;/ref&gt; ''Wily Beast and Weakest Creature'' indirectly compares this ability to the creation of a [[Wikipedia:Shintai|goshintai]]. Keiki herself indirectly suggests she could do a goshintai for Reimu &lt;ref&gt; ''[[Wily Beast and Weakest Creature]]'' - Reimu (Wolf) Ending &lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from haniwa, idols crafted by Keiki can also take the form of other objects associated with kofun burials, such as bronze bells, mirrors, swords, and magatama. According to [[Mayumi]], anything Keiki crafts will end up with a soul inhabiting it. &lt;ref&gt; ''[[Wily Beast and Weakest Creature]]'' - Marisa (Wolf) Ending &lt;/ref&gt;

==Backstory==
In the [[Animal Realm]], where the strongest is who reigns and the weaklings are subjugated to them, the human spirits couldn’t compete with the strength of the beast spirits. They lived as slaves at the mercy of beasts, specially after the latter created organizations. That way, the human spirits lived in the [[Primate Spirit Garden]], a place for them created by the beast spirits.

However, the human spirits looked for a way to get free of the beasts’ control. That way was asking and praying for a savior. After praying, Keiki was born and she told them to deposit their faith in the idols she created. They did as she told them and the idols became the true governors of the garden and they started to conquer the Animal Realm. As they don’t feel tired or sick, they were the perfect warriors. Furthermore, the beast spirits couldn’t touch them, as the idols were only hurt by physical attacks. But the beast spirits didn’t stand there with their arms crossed. They thought about a plan in which they would bring an invasion of the surface to attract a human with flesh and a body who will fight against the idols and Keiki, invasion that provoked the events of ''[[Wily Beast and Weakest Creature]]'' &lt;ref&gt; ''[[Wily Beast and Weakest Creature]]'' - [[Yachie]]’s Profile &lt;/ref&gt;

==Character Design==
===Origin===
Keiki seems to be based on {{nihongo|''Haniyasu''|ハニヤス}}, a Shinto god of soil, agriculture, and pottery. According to the ''[[wikipedia:Kojiki|Kojiki]]'', when Izanami died after giving birth to the fire ''kami'' [[wikipedia:Kagu-tsuchi|Kagu-tsuchi]], multiple gods emerged from her bodily remains. Two gods of soil were born from her feces: a god named {{nihongo|''Haniyasubiko no Kami''|波邇夜須毘古神}}, and a goddess named {{nihongo|''Haniyasuhime no Kami''|波邇夜須毘売神}}. Both of these gods are often conflated into a singular entity known as ''Haniyasu''. In the Nihon Shoki, only one deity is born this way instead, a goddess called Haniyamahime.

Many Haniyasu shrines are located in the Fukuoka prefecture, which is also known for its unique, elaborately decorated burial mounds ({{lang|ja|装飾古墳}}). Some of the painted decorations found in them resemble the patterns on the edge of Keiki's dress and sleeves.

Keiki's outfit is based on a variety of so-called "priestess haniwa," thought to represent clergywomen or mediums, and usually used as the basis of reconstructions of Kofun era women's clothing. Both the asymmetrical outerwear and the headkerchief Keiki wears are common features of this type of haniwa.

Her necklace consists out of magatama, comma-shaped beads produced between the Jomon and Kofun periods, initially worn as ordinary jewelry, but viewed exclusively as ritual objects and symbols of divinity in later times.

===Name===
Her full name is {{nihongo|''Haniyasushin Keiki''|埴安神 袿姫}}. Her surname is {{nihongo|''Haniyasushin''|埴安神}}. {{nihongo|''Haniyasu''|埴安}} is taken from the name of the ''kami'' on which she is based, and comprises the characters for "clay" and "ease". The last character, ''shin'' ({{lang|ja|神}}), loosely means "god", and is present in the names of various ''kami'' throughout Shinto mythology.

Her given name is {{nihongo|''Keiki''|袿姫}}. The ''kei'' ({{lang|ja|袿}}) refers to uchigi, a colorful robe that was often worn in several layers as part of a ''[[wikipedia:Jūnihitoe|jūnihitoe]]'', a formal dress worn by ladies-in-waiting at the Japanese Imperial Court during the Heian period and are also worn at important ceremonial functions such as weddings and enthronements. The character ''ki'' ({{lang|ja|姫}}) means "princess" or any lady of noble birth. Thus,{{nihongo|''Keiki''|袿姫}} roughly means "uchigi princess".

===Design===
Keiki's design seems to be based on reconstructions of Kofun period clothing. She wears a green headkerchief, similar to these commonly seen on the so-called [https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e9/Haniwa%2C_Tomb_Culture_300-500_AD%2C_Honshu%2C_Japan_-_AMNH_-_DSC06256.JPG "priestess" haniwa], and a yellow dress and green apron likely also based on [https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/ff/Haniwa_Figure_of_a_Shamaness_79.278.1.jpg haniwa outfits]. The spiral decorations on her dress are similar to paintings from some of the [[wikipedia:Decorated_kofun|ornamented kofun]] from the Fukuoka prefecture. Her necklace consists out of a number of multicolored [[wikipedia:Magatama|magatama]], comma-shaped beads often used as a symbol of divinity, and described as a frequent offering for the gods in early Japanese chronicles. She also holds a variety of contemporary sculpting tools in her hands and has more in pockets at waist height. 

==Appearances==
===Games===
[[File:Th17KeikiSprite.png|frame|right|Keiki's sprite in ''[[Wily Beast and Weakest Creature|WBaWC]]'']]
;[[Wily Beast and Weakest Creature]]

The final boss of the game. She immediately recognizes the animal spirit that took possession of the protagonist, but wonders why it has the form of a human. After seeing that she is facing a human under the influence of an animal spirit, she sees through the animal spirits' plan, mocks it, and tries to convince the protagonist to side with her. After the latter doesn't give in (or, as in Youmu's case, thinks back and forth for too long), Keiki attacks them.

Unbeknownst to both the Protagonist and the animal spirit that took control of the protagonist, the entire conversation with Keiki was merely used to stall time so Keiki could charge up her sculpturing arts, by which every single beast spirit was defeated. Upon realizing this, the animal spirit that took control over the protagonist panics and urges them to flee, which causes Keiki to start chasing them out of the [[Primate Spirit Garden]], the ensuing battle occurs throughout several locations in the [[Animal Realm]] such as high above a city, or at ground level in a city, Keiki is only defeated after an overwhelming force of animal spirits come to the protagonists' aid.

==Relationships== 
;[[Mayumi Joutouguu]]
[[Mayumi]] was pottered by Keiki as the leader of her Haniwa army. She doesn't talk about her creation in her dialogues, but since Mayumi is clearly more elaborate and human-like than the idols they both use in their battles, Keiki seems to have made an effort with her. There's also nothing to say that she didn't give her a real personality. Mayumi shows a lot of loyalty and respect towards her.
;[[Yachie Kicchou]] and other animal spirits.
Keiki looks down on animal spirits and titles all three options with insults - keiga (strong-teeth, including wolves with Saki Kurokoma as leader) have more teeth than brains, kiketsu (onimeisters, including the otters, under the command of Yachie Kicchou) stink, and the gouyoku (festive spirits, including eagles) have no abilities other than pride. (At least with her statements about wolves and eagles, she seems to have a point). Later, however, she converses quite amiably with Yachie, but she dismisses this matter-of-factly and sees Keiki as out of place in hell. &lt;ref name="KY"/&gt;

===Minor Relationships===
;[[Saki Kurokoma]]
Keiki also doesn't talk about Saki, as she is introduced after her, but it is known that Saki is impressed by the strength of the goddess, despite her dislike.

;[[Reimu Hakurei]] and [[Marisa Kirisame]]
Keiki acts friendly towards the protagonists in the endings, and offers to craft a goshintai for the Hakurei god and a figure of Marisa. &lt;ref&gt; ''[[Wily Beast and Weakest Creature]]'' - Marisa (Eagle) Ending &lt;/ref&gt; Marisa appears to have 
a positive opinion about Keiki, as she isn't sure why the beast spirits hate her, and visits her domain after the events of the game.

*Keiki appears on the jewel case of ''[[Wily Beast and Weakest Creature]]'', along with [[Yachie Kicchou]] and [[Saki Kurokoma]].
*In the [[Strange Creators of Outer World/Wily Beast and Weakest Creature Interview with ZUN|Strange Creators of Outer World interview]] about ''Wily Beast and Weakest Creature'', ZUN states that [[Eika Ebisu|Eika's]] title purposely ties into Keiki's idolatry theme. This might be a nod to gods they're based on being siblings according to the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki genealogies.

&lt;br&gt;
Keiki Haniyasushin&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Species: God&lt;br&gt;
Ability: Capable of creating idols&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

A god summoned by the human spirits of the Primate Spirit Garden to pull them back from the brink of disaster.&lt;br&gt;
She is capable of crafting elaborate idols.&lt;br&gt;
The idols she creates are excellent items that can gather faith, act as stand-ins, play with you, and decorate your home.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

She took control of the Primate Spirit Garden and extended her protection to the human spirits being treated horribly by the animal spirits.&lt;br&gt;
She believed that they could coexist with the animal spirits as well, if they could come to respect the human spirits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

However, she never thought that the likes of the animal spirits would come up with a plan to bring over a human from the surface to destroy her idols.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Tricking a human into participating in their strategy to wrest control from the human spirits... what a truly beastly act.

{{nihongo|'''Keine Kamishirasawa'''|上白沢　慧音|Kamishirasawa Keine}} is a [[Therianthrope|were]]-[[hakutaku]] who acts as the guardian of the [[Human Village]]. During the events of ''[[Imperishable Night]]'', she uses her abilities to conceal the [[Human Village]] from the heroines. She shows herself again in the extra stage on the night of the true full moon, having assumed her hakutaku form.

==General Information==
===Personality===
Keine is loyal to her duties to the Human Village, both as a schoolteacher and as its guardian. As a proper teacher, she doesn't like people who are discourteous, but other than that, she is generally friendly towards humans - except, perhaps, for when she has assumed her [[hakutaku]] form.

===Abilities===
;Eating and creating history
Keine possesses a different ability for each of her forms. In human form, she can "eat" history, as she did in the events of ''[[Imperishable Night]]''. Though it is stated as "eating", it is clear that she is only concealing history from outside viewers. In her [[hakutaku]] form, however, she is able to create history; she is also apparently aware of the entire history of [[Gensokyo]] in this state, according to her official profile.

[[Hieda no Akyuu]], however, states in ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Keine Kamishirasawa|Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'' that the Hieda clan's history is above Keine's powers, and is thus not "hers".

===Occupation===
Keine spends her days as a history teacher in a school in the [[Human Village#Sub-Locations|Human Village]], but also acts as its guardian, as she did in [[Imperishable Night]].

==Backstory==
Prior to the events of ''[[Imperishable Night]]'', Keine, being sensitive to the (full) moon herself, had felt the strange events that had taken place. As a guardian of the village, she had concealed its history to protect the inhabitants from youkai, making it seem like no village existed there in the first place. After being defeated, Keine redirected the heroines to the real culprit responsible for the false moon in the sky. Later, during the Extra Stage, Keine acts as [[Fujiwara no Mokou]]'s guardian trying to prevent the player from reaching and facing Mokou.

==Character Design==
[[File:PMiSS keine.jpg|thumb|160px|Keine's portrait from ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'']]
===Origin===
Keine is based on hakutaku, a mythical creature depicted as a white ox with an elderly man's head and multiple eyes, sometimes described as a minor god, originally appearing in one of the myths about emperor Huang Di.  Hakutaku could talk and purportedlly visited the greatest and most auspicious of rulers. According to the myth, the hakutaku explained that there were 11,520 youkai in the world, and how to deal with them. The emperor set all that knowledge down in an encyclopedia of youkai, known as the Bai Ze Tu (白泽图); tradition considers this work to be lost. In Japan, the hakutaku is also seen as a ward against disease.

===Name===
The kanji for Keine translate loosely to "wise sound" while Kamishirasawa literally means "upper white swamp". The kanji for "white swamp" are the same used to spell hakutaku. 

===Design===
In her human form, Keine has brown eyes and long silver hair with blue highlights. She wears a hat that looks like some kind of building with a red ribbon on top and glyphs inscribed along its side. Her dress is dark blue with white short sleeves, and a red ribbon is tied to the bottom of the collar. In her hakutaku form she has red eyes, long silver hair with green highlights, and horns. Her left horn is decorated with a red ribbon. Her dress is dark green with white short sleeves, and a red ribbon is tied to the bottom of the collar.

===Games===
;Imperishable Night
[[File:Th08KeineSprite.png|frame|Keine's sprite in ''IN'']]
[[File:Th08KeineEXSprite.png|frame|Keine's sprite in ''IN'' extra stage]]
During ''[[Imperishable Night]]'', Keine, being sensitive to the moon herself, sensed the strange events that were occurring. As a safeguard, she hid the [[Human Village]]'s history, making it as if there had never been a village there to begin with, so that the inhabitants would be protected from any sort of powerful [[youkai]]. After being defeated, Keine pointed the heroines toward the ones responsible for the fake moon in the sky. Later, during the Extra Stage, Keine acted as guardian of [[Fujiwara no Mokou]] and attempted to stop the player from reaching and facing Mokou.

===Spin-offs===
;''Shoot the Bullet''
In ''[[Shoot the Bullet]]'', [[Aya Shameimaru]] encountered Keine on [[stage]] 3 and took photos of her [[danmaku]].

;''Hopeless Masquerade''
[[File:Th135Keine.png|frame|Keine in ''HM'']]
Keine made a background cameo appearance in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'' on the [[Human Village]] stage. She is seen sitting with [[Fujiwara no Mokou]] and clapping her hands as though she's entertained by the fights.

;''Impossible Spell Card''
:{{Main|Impossible Spell Card#Story|l1=Impossible Spell Card: Story}}
Presumably from hearing or seeing a wanted sign about the mischief-making [[amanojaku]] [[Seija Kijin]], Keine appears to be one of the many [[human]]s and [[youkai]] that tries to capture her on day 3. She uses [[spell card]]s that are considered impossible to dodge.

===Literature===
;[[Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red]]
Keine comments on an alleged "secret society" that is trying to unveil the secrets of the origins of [[Gensokyo]], saying that it's not what humans should be spending their time thinking about; instead, they should be passing down what is happening now as history to their descendants. Some time later, after opening a history school, she notes in her interview with [[Aya]] that it isn't very popular. She also comments on [[Reimu]]'s ineptitude as a [[shrine maiden]] in retaining the balance between [[youkai]] and humans, and says that she has pretty much taken her place in that role - that is, of being inclined towards humans, rather than youkai.

;[[Cage in Lunatic Runagate]]
Keine gives [[Fujiwara no Mokou]] an explanation regarding the origins of the [[Youkai Mountain]].

==Additional Information==
*Keine seems to have a strong desire to protect [[human]]s and would probably be the safest person in Gensokyo for any human to be around.
*When she becomes a Hakutaku, her clothes change color and she seems to grow a tail.
*Keine fits the description in ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'' of one who acquired therianthropy, rather than one who was born with it. Her transformation into a were-hakutaku is not a full body-transformation, which she points out to [[Yukari Yakumo|Yukari]] in ''[[Imperishable Night]]'', whereas one who is born as a were-beast takes on a full body beast form during a full moon. If this is the case, it would mean Keine was once human but cursed to be a were-hakutaku.
*Most of her [[Spell Card|spell cards]] are based on the history of the [[wikipedia:Emperor of Japan|Emperor of Japan]].
*Keine is the only character in ''Imperishable Night'' to have 2 Last Word Spell Cards rather than 1.

Stage 3 boss. Half human, half beast.
She has the ability to eat (conceal) history, and the ability to create history.

The former of two abilities belongs to her human form, the latter to her beast form.
She's normally in her human form, but her true form is a were-hakutaku. She transforms into a hakutaku
during the full moon, at which time all information is known to her. When the full moon disappears,
she feels a little sick to her stomach.

Ever a friend of the humans, she protects them from Gensokyo's many youkai.
There is not one thing about the history of Gensokyo that she does not know.

Species: Were-[[hakutaku]]

Abilities: Eating (concealing) history, and creating history

Keine looks like an ordinary human most of the time, but she is actually a were-hakutaku who transforms into a hakutaku under the light of the full moon. As a human, she has the ability to eat histories. As a hakutaku, she possesses all knowledge about [[Gensokyo]], and possess the ability to create history.

When she first noticed this incident, she thought it was an opponent with considerably great power, and she decided to seal the [[Human Village]] during the night in order to protect humans from [[youkai]].

She devoured the village's history to make it unable to be seen.

Although Keine is a youkai, she loves humans and always tries to help them. She only uses her ability when it would benefit humans.

'''Kikuri''' is a large bronze disc with an image of a girl on it that [[Reimu Hakurei]] ecounters in [[Hell]]'s [[Hell#PC-98's_Hell|Rotting World of Flames]]. Kikuri is the [[Stage]] 15 [[boss]] on the Hell route of ''[[Highly Responsive to Prayers]]''. However, since she has no profile and no dialogue exchange with Reimu, nothing much is known about this enemy.

==Character Design==

===Origin===
Kikuri is most likely based on [[wikipedia:Kukurihime|Kikurihime]] (菊理媛 lit. "Lady Kikuri" or "Princess Kikuri") a [[Shinto]] goddess who mediated the dispute between the two primordial Shinto creator [[god]]s [[wikipedia:Izanagi|Izanagi]] and [[wikipedia:Izanami|Izanami]] in [[wikipedia:Yomi|Yomi]], the Shinto land of the dead. Kikurihime, due to being the mediator of the conversation between Izanami and Izanagi, is said to be the goddess of love, marraige, and negotiation. In fact, it's speculated that her name orginally came from the word 括り(''kukuri'') meaning to bind or to tie (relating to her status as a matchmaking god). She was later conflated with the [[dragon]] goddess Shirayamahime, who is worshipped at [[Wikipedia:Mount Haku|Mount Haku]]. Through this she gained the attributes of being a patron god of fertile land and rain.

===Name===
Her name is displayed in-game as ''Kikuri''. There's no official [[wikipedia:Kana|kana]] or [[wikipedia:Kanji|kanji]] spelling of her name just like with the rest of the ''[[Highly Responsive to Prayers]]'' cast, but her name can be written as "{{lang|ja|菊理}}" where {{nihongo||菊|kiku}} means "chrysanthemum", a symbolic flower of Japan, and where {{nihongo||理|ri}} means "reason", "logic" or "general principle" in [[Buddhism]].

===Design===
Her sprite in ''[[Highly Responsive to Prayers]]'' displays her as a large bronze disk with a fiery purple aura. The disc contains an image of a girl with long hair sporting a content, closed-eye expression. Ribbons or feathers seem to be on both sides of her head, flanking a white dot on her forehead. A similar white orb can be seen between her clasped hands. She also appears to be wearing modern attire, complete with a tie or ascot of some sort. In ''Highly Responsive to Prayers''' "Good Ending #2", Kikuri is seen in a position where she's partially exiting her disk. This implies that she's not some engraving or picture but rather a being inhabiting the disk.

==Additional Information==
*[[Elis]] and Kikuri share the same theme titled "Magic Mirror". Kikuri's variation uses slightly different instruments in a lower pitch, however.
**Magic Mirror's Japanese name, 魔鏡 (''makyou''), refers to a type of traditional bronze mirror brought over from China. These bronze [[wikipedia:Chinese_magic_mirror|magic mirrors]] are often used as ritual objects of worship in Shinto shrines and Buddhist temples where they were thought to represent gods or be inhabited by gods.
***Taking this into account, Kikuri may actually be the goddess [[Wikipedia:Kukurihime|Kikurihime]] inhabiting or possessing a bronze magic mirror.
*Kikuri's version of Magic Mirror is listed in the files of ''Highly Responsive to Prayers'' as "KAMI.MDT", ''kami'' (神) being the Japanese word for god.
*Kikuri is faced in ''Highly Responsive to Prayers''' Hell route likely because the goddess Kikurihime was present in [[wikipedia:Yomi|Yomi]], the Shinto underworld.
**In some Japanese translations of the [[wikipedia:Bible|Bible]], ''Yomi'' is used to replace the words ''Hades'' and ''Hell''.
*Kikuri's title, "HellMoon", may come from the association that mirrors and the moon have in Japanese culture.
**For example, the moon god [[wikipedia:Tsukuyomi|Tsukuyomi]] is said to have been born out of a copper mirror. Another example is the Japanese proverb 鏡花水月 (''kyouka sugetsu'' lit. "[[wikipedia:Mirror_Flower,_Water_Moon|mirror flower, water moon]]") that connects the fleeting, untouchable beauty of a moon being reflected on the surface of water to a flower being reflected on a mirror. 
*In China, there existed "[[wikipedia:Chinese_sun_and_moon_mirrors|moon mirrors]]" (方諸 ''fangzhu'') that were used to gather water during the nighttime.
*Kikuri's connection to the moon might also come from juxtaposition with the Shinto sun goddess [[wikipedia:Amaterasu|Amaterasu]]. Amaterasu's symbol is the yellow chrysanthemum which represents the sun and Japan (''The Land of The Rising Sun'') as a whole. Kikurihime's symbol is also the chrysanthemum, particularly the white chrysanthemum, which symbolizes death (due to her connection to Yomi) and, if taken to be the opposite of Amaterasu's chrysanthemum, the moon. 
**[[ZUN]] had a tendency to reference the [[wikipedia:Megami_Tensei|Shin Megami Tensei]] video game series quite a bit during the [[PC-98]] era. The original [[wikipedia:Shin_Megami_Tensei|Shin Megami Tensei]] on the [[wikipedia:PC_Engine|PC Engine]], released in 1993, featured both Kikurihime and Amaterasu, with Kikurihime being a simple palette swap of Amaterasu. Additionally, the area of [[Hell]] Kikuri is in, the "Rotting World of Flames" (炎の腐界), is a direct reference to [[Wikipedia:Digital_Devil_Story:_Megami_Tensei|Megami Tensei's]] "Rotting Sea of Flames" (炎の腐海).
*Kikurihime is considered to be the ''[[Wikipedia:Honji_suijaku|honji]]'' (manifestion) of the androgynous [[Wikipedia:bodhisattva|bodhisattva]] Kannon (Japanese version of [[Wikipedia:Avalokitesvara|Avalokitesvara]]) by some Buddhist sects.
**This may have influenced Kikuri's pose and appearance. Representions of Kannon often have him/her with closed eyes and clasped hands, just like Kikuri. In fact, this idea can adequately explain Kikuri's strange head dot and ball of light. Kannon, like most Buddhist figures, has what's called an [[wikipedia:urna|urna]] (白毫 ''byakugo'') on his/her forehead. Kannon is also commonly depicted with a jewel called a [[Wikipedia:cintamani|cintamani]] (如意宝珠 ''nyoi houju'') that grants any wish one may desire. This jewel is commonly depicted as a glowing orb of light in Buddhist art. For comparison between the two, see [https://imgur.com/a/KAxJmwX here].
***It might also explain why Kikuri is in ''Jigoku'' (Buddhist Hell) instead of ''Yomi'' (Shinto Hell).

{{nihongo|'''Kisume'''|キスメ}} is a rather shy [[Tsurube-otoshi]] who usually spends her time in buckets. She is often seen in dark places such as caves or wells. As a [[Boss|midboss]] with no dialogue and a sparse official profile, little is known about her.

==General Information==
Kisume was the [[stage]] 1 midboss of ''[[Subterranean Animism]]'' and has made a cameo appearance in ''[[Oriental Sacred Place]]'' chapter 10 and ''[[Forbidden Scrollery]]'' chapter 2.

===Abilities===
;Ability to drop will-o'-the-wisps
It is to literally drop will-o'-the-wisps from the objective that is on top of her head. It probably comes from her species as {{nihongo|[[wikipedia:ja:釣瓶火|tsurubebi]]|釣瓶火||lit. "well-bucket fire"}}, thought to be the same as tsurube-otoshi. Her spell cards have many that drop danmaku vertically, which would be the specialty of her species.

==Character Design==
===Origin===
Tsurube otoshi (lit. ''bucket dropper'') are a type of [[youkai]] believed to have originated in the Chuubu region of Japan. They usually live atop trees, and when humans come close to the tree a bucket or a severed head drops down and eats them. They are also sometimes depicted as flaming spirits. There is also a traditional Japanese proverb somewhat related to her species: {{nihongo|"The autumn sun descends like a bucket falling into a well"|秋の陽は釣瓶落とし|Aki no Hi wa Tsurube Otoshi}}. It is a proverb used to indicate how the days in Autumn get shorter.

===Name===
Her full name is {{nihongo|''Kisume''|キスメ}}. According to [[ZUN]], her name is written in [[wikipedia:Katakana|katakana]] to give it an old feel, and it's not written in kanji because "that would make her seem too strong".&lt;ref name="interview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm5903008 |title=Interview on Subterranean Animism with Cara☆Mel‎|author=[[Cara☆Mel‎]]|date=25 December 2008|language=ja|accessdate=22 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Design===
Kisume has a pale skin with dark teal hair tied up in pigtails by white hair beads. The bucket she sits in is a cherry brown with black hoops near the top and bottom. She wears a white robe with an obi.

==Appearances==
===Windows Games===
;''Subterranean Animism''
[[File:Th11KisumeSprite.png|frame|Kisume's sprite in ''SA'']]
:{{Main|SA#Story|l1=Subterranean Animism Story}}
In the events of ''Subterranean Animism'', she attacks the heroine on her way to the underground by dropping on her. She is disposed of quickly.

===Spin-offs===
;''Double Spoiler''
In ''[[Double Spoiler]]'', Kisume appeared as a [[stage]] 3 target, where she uses a few [[spell card]]s and had [[Aya Shameimaru]] and [[Hatate Himekaidou]] take photos of her and her [[danmaku]].

===Literature===
;''Symposium of Post-mysticism''
[[File:ThGK Bunbunmaru3.jpg|thumb|right|Kisume as she appears in ''[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]].'']]
:{{Main|Symposium of Post-mysticism/Bunbunmaru Newspaper 3|l1=Symposium of Post-mysticism: Skeletal Remains Found from the Dry Well}}
Back in 1984, [[Aya Shameimaru]] reports that during Gensokyo's winter, children were finding skeletal remains of a [[human]] while playing around a dried-up well, to which it ended up that the well was declared to be off-limits. Apparently, a [[tsurube-otoshi]] [[youkai]] (presumably Kisume) came out of well saying "So is THIS the body you dropped down here?" and threw the bones at them. There were no-one missing, so for who the bones belong to is a mystery.

The bones disappeared while no-one was looking during preparations to bury it in [[Muenzuka]]. This rolled onto a case whether there was any sort of [[incident]] or not, along with the identity of the previous owner of the bones. [[Yukari Yakumo]] though it was by the youkai from the [[Underworld]] and that they wanted to scare the humans since their powers come from the negative energy of humans, but it may've been a simple misunderstanding. There was a non-intervention agreement pact made between the underworld youkai and the surface, so the situation could become complicated. Tengu hope to avoid trouble with the underground.

The incident was settled as silver birch branches have been mistaken for bones, to which no ominous occurrences had happened at the [[Human Village]]. At a later date, it was confirmed that the dried-up well was filled in with dirt; who did this is unknown.

*Her ''[[Subterranean Animism]]'' portrait is very low-res, compared to many other portraits by [[ZUN]].

{{nihongo|'''{{H:title|Koakuma|This is unofficial name, but it may have been used as a term by ZUN}}'''|小悪魔|Koakuma}} is a [[devil]] where she's seen around the library of [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]] where she apparently lives in the mansion. Her sole game appearance is as the fourth stage midboss of ''[[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]]'', and little is known about her. In an interview with ZUN there was an implication that she was summoned as a familiar. In addition to this, its been stated that Vampires are capable of summoning lesser devils or familiars. 
==General Information==
===Personality===
ZUN stated that she has a capricious, mischievous, and without second thoughts personality. &lt;ref&gt; [[ZUN's former blog "Touhou Shofu" 6]] - "性格は２面ボスと似たところも多く、気まぐれでいたずら好き、後先考えずに行動します。" (Their personalities are similar to those of the two-faced bosses in many ways: capricious, mischievous, and without second thoughts.) &lt;/ref&gt;

===Occupation===
Her exact role is difficult to tell, but she is believed to be an assistant in [[Patchouli Knowledge]]'s library. She is seen carrying books in the library in all the print works she appears in.

==Character Design==
[[File:Th06Koakuma.png|thumb|right|Sprite of Koakuma in '''[[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]]''']]
===Name===
Koakuma has no official name; this was confirmed by [[ZUN]] very early on &lt;ref name="GBB"&gt; [[ZUN's reply to messages on the former Gensou Bulletin Board 1]] &lt;/ref&gt;. The commonly used name in the fanbase  is {{nihongo|''Koakuma''|小悪魔}}, meaning "Little Devil" or "[[wiktionary:imp|Imp]]". ZUN used this term in an [[ZUN%27s_reply_to_messages_on_the_former_Gensou_Bulletin_Board_1|answer of the response to the question from the fans]], while again stating at the same time that she was unnamed, though he did have rough sketches for a face sprite as well as plans to give her spell cards.&lt;ref name="GBB"/&gt;

===Design===
The sprite of Koakuma in ''Embodiment of Scarlet Devil'' shows that she wears a black dress with white sleeves. She has a small pair of black, bat-like wings on the sides of her head and long red hair.

==Additional Information==
[[File:Th06Koakuma unused sprite.png|frame|Koakuma's modified sprite]]
*In one of ''Embodiment of Scarlet Devil'''s sprite sheets, it shows Koakuma had an appearance in the Extra Stage sprites. It's just because the same image was taken from the stage 4 sprites, with a color overlay on the whole image.
*Koakuma is one of the few characters that doesn't appear in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'' as a background character. The reason is unknown.
*In a cameo appearance in ''Inaba of the Moon and Inaba of the Earth'' Chapter 23, she's depicted with two pairs of black wings, one on her head and one on her back. In ''Strange and Bright Nature Deity'' Chapter 14, she once again has black wings on both her head and her back. She also has short hair rather than long.

==Official Profiles==

*In response to questions from fans, [[ZUN]] revealed some hints of her profile&lt;ref&gt;[[ZUN's former blog "Touhou Shofu" 6]]&lt;/ref&gt;:
**[[Devil]]s are a mighty race, like [[magician]]s or [[vampire]]s. But Koakuma is far weaker. (It should be noted that ZUN is using "Little Devil" as a generic term for some weak devils. Regardless of that fact, it is usually used as a personal name of the midboss of EoSD stage 4 in the fan community though).
**Like [[Daiyousei]], she is carefree and mischievous, often behaves thoughtlessly.
**She settles in [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]].
**She is one of normal-enemy class (not boss-class) characters. There are many such characters, and they are not given any special role in the story.

{{nihongo|'''Kogasa Tatara'''|多々良　小傘|Tatara Kogasa}} is a [[Tsukumogami#Karakasa obake|karakasa obake]] whose sole purpose is to surprise people. However, she hasn't been very successful so far. She encounters the heroine on their way to catch up with the flying object on a mission to scare her, but it doesn't work. She was once a normal umbrella in the [[outside world]]; forgotten by her owner, and no one else claimed her because the colour was unpopular at the time. As time went on, the wind swept her away to [[Gensokyo]] and she became a [[youkai]]. According to her profile in ''[[Undefined Fantastic Object]]'', she is currently reading up on classic [[Ghost (Species)|ghost]] stories in order to improve her scaring technique.

==General Information==
Kogasa first appeared as the second stage boss and midboss of ''[[Undefined Fantastic Object]]'' with the boss theme "Beware the Umbrella Left There Forever", and was later a target on Stage 3 of ''[[Double Spoiler]]''. After, she became the stage 3 midboss of ''[[Ten Desires]]'' and was one of the many background characters shown in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]''. Additionally, she made cameo appearances in the manga ''[[Oriental Sacred Place]]'' and ''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'', along with having her own article in ''[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]]''.

===Personality===
As stated in ZUN's [[Undefined Fantastic Object/Translation/Music|''Undefined Fantastic Object'' music comments]], Kogasa is a cheery happy [[youkai]], but gets easily depressed when things don't go her way (which is very often), typically when she fails to surprise someone despite her best efforts. She stated she wishes for vengeance on [[human]]s for being discarded in ''[[Undefined Fantastic Object]]''. However, she's actually quite friendly to humans and her vengeance doesn't go beyond surprising and spooking humans. She gets genuinely pleased when she successfully surprises someone (or thinks she successfully surprised someone).

She despises not being taken seriously. She often attacks the protagonist in ''[[Undefined Fantastic Object]]'' in a fit of despair when she thinks they're making fun of her. She's displeased with children liking her eccentric design.

Kogasa suffers from self-esteem problems, as she is easily pushed into lamenting about wondering what her purpose is, or that she might be better off if she just went back to being an umbrella. Perhaps due to this, Kogasa is seeking a true purpose of existence for youkai, [[tsukumogami]], and herself. She attempted this by starting a career in babysitting (which did not seem to go very well), surprising people (which also isn't going very well, though she's found some success in the [[Myouren Temple]] graveyard), and was even considering going back to being an umbrella just so she can be useful in that regard. She's stated that she's trying to imagine what humans want, and then plans on becoming that something they can use.&lt;ref name="SoPMKogasa" /&gt; Deep down, it appears this pitiable illegally dumped object and troubled forgotten item just wants to be desired.

Her depression may also be another attempt at getting attention. She can get so depressed upon failing to surprise someone that it can become "a bother"&lt;ref name="SoPMKogasa" /&gt;.

Unlike other youkai, Kogasa doesn't eat humans. Instead, she eats their spirit. In her own words, if she doesn't surprise someone, she'll go hungry. In the past, humans apparently feared youkai enough that she'd get a huge portion of their spirit on a successful surprise, as according to Kogasa in ''Undefined Fantastic Object'', even a slight surprise would make a human have difficulty walking straight. This is apparently no longer the case in the present day.

===Abilities===
;Surprising humans
This ability to surprise [[human]]s does not appear to be an actual ability beyond what anyone could do, but it's her prime occupation. Kogasa's observed attempts to surprise anyone hasn't really consisted of much more than her screaming "Boo!" or simply attacking someone if pressed. It is the same ability that [[Chen]] has without shikigami (ability to the extent of surprising people), so just like with Chen, it might not be an ability of any substance. Also, there doesn't seem to be any humans that have recently come to be surprised, and whatever she does, it is like it is still trial and error. So far, in the things she said in the game, it has come off as more cute than surprising.

[[Hatate Himekaidou]] notes that she hides in the darkness to attempt to surprise people, but her hiding places are obvious. [[Hieda no Akyuu]] describes her attempts as child's play, to the point where the greater "threat" from her is how bothersome it can be to deal with her after she gets depressed by her failure to surprise someone. It's sometimes better to just pretend to be surprised in order to please her. Considering this, maybe Kogasa is unable to discern between genuine and fake shock, despite how she feeds by surprising people. It is unknown if a person pretending to be surprised provides her with any sustenance, although it does make her happy.

However, Kogasa seems to have some interesting interactions with the [[Canon#Fourth wall|fourth wall]], such as: her stated failure to defeat [[Yoshika Miyako]] in ''[[Ten Desires]]'' due to a "time out"; her appearance on the ''[[Undefined Fantastic Object]]'' CD saying {{nihongo|"Surprise~"|おどろけー|odoroke~}} despite being stated by [[ZUN]] to not be involved with the story; her appearance as the ''Undefined Fantastic Object'' extra-stage mid-boss despite not having any relation to the story, which comes complete with a "Surprise!" sound effect to hammer the point home (the only extra-stage mid-boss in the series with no real involvement in the story); and dropping the first big power-up in ''[[Ten Desires]]'' upon her defeat. Similarly, she appears on ''Undefined Fantastic Object'''s Steam page as [https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1100160/ss_2ef88b632f5d1e53b7fc715196fc46d3afe95f45.600x338.jpg?t=1590144027 one of the preview images], presumably to surprise any would-be buyers of the game. It is unknown if this is an in-story [[canon]] ability or just an out-of-story running gag.

;Blacksmithing
Surprisingly, Kogasa has demonstrated a mastership for Blacksmithing. She proclaims that no human smith could measure up to her skills, a feat proved true when she perfectly recreated Reimu's throwing needles despite Reimu not remembering where they came from. Kogasa proudly claims that she could make all kinds of wares, from bells to mirrors and more. &lt;ref&gt;Wild and Horned Hermit chapter 20&lt;/ref&gt;

==Backstory==
According to Kogasa's conversation with Sanae in ''Undefined Fantastic Object'', as far as Kogasa could tell, she was an umbrella that was thrown out by her original owner because her design was a little off. Eventually, she was blown away with the wind. Unwanted and undesired, the divine spirit residing within the umbrella became angered after being abandoned. Hoping to get back at the human that threw her out, Kogasa became a youkai. She then (badly) modified her own appearance to look more ferocious and youkai-like, and her quest for revenge on humanity (by surprising them!) had begun.

It is unknown when Kogasa was first abandoned as an umbrella to become a tsukumogami. However, she's expressed to Reimu how she misses the old days when youkai ruled the night, and when even slightly surprising a person made them unable to walk straight. Reimu finds her "old-time" stories uninteresting, and [[Marisa Kirisame]] comments that Kogasa is "really behind the times." This would imply that Kogasa has been around for a long time.

==Character Design==
[[Image:ThGKKogasa.png|thumb|right|200px|Kogasa as depicted in ''[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]]'']]
===Name===
Her full name is {{nihongo|''Kogasa Tatara''|多々良　小傘}}. The characters for {{nihongo||小傘|Kogasa}} mean "little umbrella". {{nihongo||踏鞴|[[wikipedia:Tatara (furnace)|Tatara]]}} is the traditional Japanese method of smelting iron. Many workers lost an eye checking the colour of the fire to measure its temperature and/or a leg pushing the tatara furnaces. They wore [[wikipedia:Geta (footwear)|geta]] to avoid the heat of floor which brought about the tale of the Ippon Datara, a one-eyed, one-legged youkai that somewhat resembles a karakasa obake.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20130122021648/http://www.obakemono.com:80/obake/ippondatara/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hieda no Akyuu]] states that Kogasa modified the appearance of her umbrella to resemble this youkai, and believes she derives her name from it.&lt;ref name="SoPMKogasa" /&gt;

===Design===
Kogasa has turquoise hair, one turquoise eye and one red eye. The design purpose of her eyes is likely to be retaining the appearance of [[wikipedia:Kasa-obake|Karakasa obake]], which is an one-eyed youkai, by blending her right eye into her hair that has the same color, and to high-light the left-red eye as an one-eyed one. For the same reason, she is depicted as standing on one leg in her official art. She wears a blue-green vest with white sleeves and a light blue skirt. She holds a purple umbrella with an eye and a tongue protruding from it. 

Kogasa has been referred to as both: an Umbrella, and an Ghost Umbrella. The umbrella and the girl are actually the same being; she modified the appearance of the umbrella to make herself look more ferocious.

==Appearances==
===Games===
;Undefined Fantastic Object
[[File:Th12KogasaSprite.png|frame|Kogasa's sprite in ''UFO'']]
Kogasa's role in ''[[Undefined Fantastic Object]]'' is rather limited. In Stage 2, she appears twice, trying to surprise the heroine, who doesn't particularly want anything to do with her, as she is slowing her pursuit of the flying object. They engage in a high-speed aerial battle that inevitably ends with Kogasa's defeat and the heroine's arrival at the flying object. Also inevitably, she misinterprets what the heroine says as the answer to how to surprise humans. She returns in the extra stage under the assumption that it being night is enough to scare humans, and is defeated once again by the heroine. As such, she is the only character that is completely unrelated to the story in ''Undefined Fantastic Object'', as well as the only unrelated character to be in an Extra Stage.

:{{Main|Undefined Fantastic Object/Story/Reimu A's Scenario#Stage2|l1=Reimu A Arc}}
Kogasa notices Reimu chasing the treasure ship. Commenting that she's had lots of free time lately, she asks Reimu if she could "play" with her for a bit while chasing the ship. Reimu comments that it must be nice to be a youkai with spare time, even if they did exist just to be exterminated. However, with so many youkai around, Reimu doesn't have time to exterminate every one. Kogasa laments that humans are no fun, and really should plan extra time into their schedule for playing around, to which Reimu remarks that extra time is pointless. The umbrella ghost retorts that pointlessness is beautiful, and life would be terrible if everything were just planned out. As an example, Kogasa states that it's not the functionality of a tool that makes it beautiful. It's the useless parts that create a youkai. Frustrated that she's wasting time having a philosophical discussion with an umbrella, Reimu agrees to play with Kogasa and exterminates her, snapping that Kogasa should just fall out of the sky. Afterwards, Kogasa cries about how cruel humans are, at which Reimu points out that Kogasa seemed like she wanted to lose. Reimu is unable to put her finger on what that's called, so Kogasa remarks that she thinks it's sadism. The shrine maiden notes that it's actually the opposite of that, but the ship is now in view, so she thanks Kogasa for taking her there and heads off.

:{{Main|Undefined Fantastic Object/Story/Reimu B's Scenario#Stage2|l1=Reimu B Arc}}
Kogasa notices Reimu chasing the treasure ship. She tells Reimu that it's unusual to see a human flying around like that, so she came to check things out. Commenting that she's been bored lately, Kogasa expresses disappointment that Reimu wasn't surprised by her. The shrine maiden doesn't see why she should be surprised by an umbrella flying around. At this point, Kogasa starts lamenting at how people no longer fear youkai, remembering how long ago even a little surprise from her made people unable to walk straight. Reimu is annoyed at Kogasa's old stories wasting her time, but her request for Kogasa to move aside is interrupted when Kogasa comes to the conclusion that in order to surprise someone today, you had to beat them up, and the umbrella ghost attacks. After being exterminated, Kogasa cries out wondering what exactly youkai are, but Reimu shrugs it off stating that maybe they were just luxury items, and heads off on her way.

:{{Main|Undefined Fantastic Object/Story/Marisa A's Scenario#Stage2|l1=Marisa A Arc}}
Kogasa notices Marisa chasing the treasure ship, and asks her to wait up. Marisa refuses because she wants to reach the ship. Possibly attempting a reverse psychology gambit, Kogasa decides to listen to her request and states she'll leave Marisa alone, then. Getting suspicious at this behavior, Marisa tells Kogasa she'll wait after all, at which point Kogasa quickly reverses her decision to leave, stating she had lots of free time. Marisa asks if Kogasa is a patrol from the ship, and Kogasa replies that she's just a cheerful youkai that likes to surprise people. She commands Marisa to be surprised, but the witch is not impressed, causing Kogasa to cry. Marisa tells Kogasa to get out of the way, but the umbrella ghost decides that she might be able to surprise Marisa by attacking her. This too fails to surprise Marisa, who states that all youkai are just like that. At this, Kogasa cries again, her reason to live as a youkai apparently being a failure. Marisa sarcastically states that what would really surprise her was if Kogasa's umbrella was even capable of protecting her from the rain. Not realizing Marisa was insulting her, Kogasa wonders if she should go back to doing that, at which point Marisa notices the ship and leaves Kogasa behind.

:{{Main|Undefined Fantastic Object/Story/Marisa B's Scenario#Stage2|l1=Marisa B Arc}}
Kogasa notices Marisa chasing the treasure ship, and asks her to wait. Marisa asks what she wants, and the umbrella ghost replies that she was bored, because no one was ever surprised by her anymore. Marisa snarkily comments that a normal umbrella flying in the wind would be scarier than Kogasa because it at least might bump into you. Not realizing Marisa was insulting her, Kogasa decides to try just that, proclaiming that she'll smash Marisa up. After Marisa smashed Kogasa up, Marisa expresses confusion that Kogasa seemed softer than an actual umbrella. Thinking on this, Kogasa realizes that she's soft like konjac jelly, and maybe she could use that to surprise humans! Marisa can only comment that Kogasa is really behind the times.

:{{Main|Undefined Fantastic Object/Story/Sanae A's Scenario#Stage2|l1=Sanae A Arc}}
Kogasa notices Sanae chasing the treasure ship, and asks her to wait up. Sanae asks what she wants, to which Kogasa replies with a "Boo!" The shrine maiden is unable to figure out what Kogasa's doing. Sighing, Kogasa remarks that she's lonely and asks if Sanae could at least be a little surprised, but Sanae states she's used to those things. Depressed, Kogasa explains that youkai were trying their best to surprise humans, but Sanae retorts that what she heard was they were doing their best to eat humans. Kogasa replies that some youkai eat meat, but others eat spirit, and if humans aren't surprised by her, she'll go hungry. Sanae comments that must be harsh, but at least she could see that getting surprised could be fun. She clarifies to a confused Kogasa that it's because youkai hunting was fun, and promptly exterminates the umbrella. Afterwards, a sad Kogasa asks what the point is of a youkai that can't surprise people, and that maybe she should just go back to being an umbrella. Sanae wonders if anyone would want an old umbrella that looks like an eggplant, which just makes Kogasa further depressed as it reminds her that being unwanted was why she became a youkai in the first place. The shrine maiden regrets bringing it up.

:{{Main|Undefined Fantastic Object/Story/Sanae B's Scenario#Stage2|l1=Sanae B Arc}}
Kogasa notices Sanae chasing the treasure ship, and asks her to wait up. Sanae asks what she wants, to which Kogasa replies with a "Boo!" The shrine maiden is unimpressed. She states that ghost umbrellas and "Boo!" were old news, and asks why her umbrella is eggplant colored. Kogasa cries at this, and tells Sanae how she really tried her best to look youkai-like, because she was thrown out by her owner. She wanted to get back at her owner so she became a youkai. Sanae expresses sorrow for Kogasa, but honestly states that if a friend gave her an umbrella like that, she would have refused and just walked home in the rain. Angry that Sanae wouldn't understand her, Kogasa screams that Sanae should just melt in the acid rain and attacks. After Sanae exterminates her, Kogasa snaps that she can't stand it, and threatens that she might just go over and mess up Sanae's shrine. Sanae threatens her right back, stating that such an action would be self-destructive because then she'd have to exterminate Kogasa for real.

;Ten Desires
After the events of ''Undefined Fantastic Object'', she has been plotting to go scare [[Byakuren Hijiri]] at her newly-built temple. In ''[[Ten Desires]]'', she takes to the cemetery adjacent to the [[Myouren Temple]] and the surrounding sky, but runs afoul of newcomer [[Yoshika Miyako]]. However, after asking the heroine to help her banish Yoshika, she also receives a beating.

===Spin-offs===
[[File:Th135Kogasa.png|thumb|frame|100px|Kogasa in ''HM'']]
;''Double Spoiler''
In ''[[Double Spoiler]]'', Kogasa appeared as a [[stage]] 3 target, where she uses a few [[spell card]]s and had [[Aya Shameimaru]] and [[Hatate Himekaidou]] take photos of her and her [[danmaku]].

;''Hopeless Masquerade''

Kogasa made a background cameo appearance in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'' on the [[Myouren Temple]] and [[Youkai Tanuki Forest]] stage. She is seen hopping with her umbrella.
[[File:Th175KogasaSprite.gif|thumb|frame|left|90px|Kogasa's sprite in ''GI'']]

;''Touhou Gouyoku Ibun''
Kogasa appears as an enemy in the [[Rainbow Cavern of Earth Spirits]] when the heroine is her way to the underground.

If the player uses [[Reimu Hakurei]], Kogasa will pop out of the ground, surprise the shrine maiden, and attacks her; but loses anyway.

If the player uses [[Minamitsu Murasa]], the phantom will encounter Kogasa while she is going underground with the [[Palanquin Ship]] and, after Kogasa asks if she can go too, Minamistu attacks her. After losing, Minamitsu explains that she is going to stop the black water, which makes Kogasa lose interest.

If the player uses [[Flandre Scarlet]], the vampire will suddenly attack her and after defeating the tsukumogami will leave using a backdoor, which made Kogasa confused and think that Flandre was one of [[Byakuren]]'s ''assassins''.

===Literature===
;Wild and Horned Hermit
Kogasa was one of the victims of a mysterious attack.

In a later chapter, she approaches Reimu during ''Kotoyouka'' with the implicit intent of terrorizing her due to the latter's weakened weapons. It is later revealed that her real reason for doing so is to offer to replace Reimu's needles with her excellent blacksmithing skills, which she eventually does. Reimu, unable to pay the bill, opts to use her new needles on Kogasa instead.

==Relationships==
===Myouren Temple===
Kogasa has a neutral relationship with [[Myouren Temple]] and is not registered as a member of this faction. Her purpose for staying there is to scare the humans that frequently visit its cemetery.&lt;ref name="SoPMKogasa" /&gt;

===Minor Relationships===
;[[Yoshika Miyako]]
Yoshika Miyako's presence in the cemetery becomes an unknown threat for Kogasa.

;[[Hakurei Shrine]] &amp; [[Moriya Shrine]]&lt;ref name="SoPMKogasa" /&gt;
These locations are listed as places that Kogasa frequents in ''Symposium of Post-mysticism'', but no reason is given. In ''Undefined Fantastic Object'', Kogasa tells Sanae that she is considering going to Sanae's shrine to wreck the place as revenge for Sanae being mean to her, which may indicate a possible reason.

==Spell Cards==
Judging by the names and graphics of her danmaku, Kogasa appears to use rain and light attacks in her spell cards (including a rainbow). From a statement by [[Hatate Himekaidou]], the extremely large spinning [[danmaku]] orbs that Kogasa throws are actually umbrellas, which creates an awkward sight of an umbrella attacking by throwing other umbrellas. Her train spell cards are actually extremely dense umbrella barages thrown so fast and so close together that they appear to be a train. Her "Karakasa Surprising Flash" seems to be a blinding flash of light. Finally, her "Umbrella Cyclone" spell card and the fact that her rain attacks can be angled may indicate she may use stormy winds as well, but this is uncertain.

==Additional Information==
*She is the only character in ''Undefined Fantastic Object'' that has no role in the story.
*She is the only Touhou character so far to have two different eye colours, known as [[wikipedia:Heterochromia|heterochromia]].
*In ''Undefined Fantastic Object'', she says "Urameshiya", which means to be jealous or bitter, while "ya" is similar to saying desu or da. It's often translated as "I'm envious," or simply "Boo," which has become her catchphrase in fandom.
**[[Ghost (Species)|Ghost]]s, [[youkai]], and possessed objects (such as [[Tsukumogami#Karakasa obake|Karakasa obake]]) are said to belong to a lower realm in the Six Realms of Buddhist belief. "Urameshiya" is often said by such creatures to express envy towards humans, whose place in the Human Realm affords them less suffering. Thus, "I envy your life!" would be a more appropriate translation, although it tends to be used in the same context as "Boo!"
*In Symposium of Post-mysticism, she thinks babysitters fly through the sky with an umbrella, referencing [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Poppins_(film) Mary Poppins].

An umbrella that was left unused and became a youkai.&lt;br /&gt;She was originally an umbrella someone forgot, but since the colour is unpopular, nobody ever picked her up, and she was carried off by the wind and became a youkai.

She rarely really hurts anyone, she just likes watching people be surprised.&lt;br/&gt;However, not many people have been surprised by her, so she's reading classic ghost stories to improve her technique.

She figured you'd be best off trying to surprise people at night,&lt;br /&gt;so that's why she showed up.&lt;br /&gt;She didn't know if anyone would really be surprised or not.&lt;br /&gt;She is the only passerby youkai in this game.&lt;br /&gt;She's currently thinking of plotting to go startle Byakuren, who just opened a temple in Gensokyo.

'''Kogasa Tatara'''

Race: karakasa obake&lt;br /&gt;
Ability: Surprising humans

A youkai umbrella that wanders around the sky above the temple.&lt;br /&gt;She found her place in the cemetery, and found herself living in the cemetery most of the time.&lt;br /&gt;This is because while humans that are rarely surprised in the middle of the road, they are easily scared when they are in the cemetery. And she finally did it. Amazing.

But an incident has crept up to disrupt her truly happy time.

A youkai who was never seen before has been appearing from the inside of the cemetery, and has been moving around like it was its home ever since.

She tried to get in contact with that youkai, but she couldn't communicate with the youkai at all. Feeling threatened, she wanted to shoo away the youkai forcefully.

But that ended up as futility. No matter how she attacked, she couldn't get a response out of it, so she escaped.

While she was considering whether she should ask for help of the members of the temple, she saw those humans that she saw before. They were those, whom she encountered and fought several times before. 

And so she thought, "They must have come to defeat that youkai!" and decided to ask boldly.

And she ended up like this.

{{nihongo|'''Koishi Komeiji'''|古明地 こいし|Komeiji Koishi}} is a [[Satori (Species)|satori]], and [[Satori Komeiji]]'s younger sister. She initially appeared as the Extra stage boss of ''[[Subterranean Animism]]'', later as a playable character in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'', ''[[Urban Legend in Limbo]]'', and ''[[Antimony of Common Flowers]]''.

==General Information==
===Personality===
Koishi's personality is generally playful and free-spirited, not unlike a child. While her ability to ''manipulate the unconscious'' makes her presence unsettling to many people, she seems overall less concerned with appearing or being scary, and more to do with whatever feels right in the moment. She does not seem to go out of her way to harm others out of malice or spite, although she has occasionally caused issues for other characters due to a lack of self-awareness, such as in her accidentally stealing [[Hata no Kokoro]]'s mask in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'', or [[Sumireko Usami]]'s smartphone in ''[[Urban Legend in Limbo]]''.

In ''Urban Legend in Limbo'', she takes on the urban legend of ''Mary-san,''&lt;ref name=mary-san&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kowabana.net/2018/06/09/mary-san/|title=Japanese Urban Legends: Mary-san|author=Tara A. Devlin|date=June 9, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; a legend similar to the western [[Wikipedia:Bloody_Mary_(folklore)|Bloody Mary]] myth. Rather than wanting to be truly menacing, however, Koishi appeared to "join in on the fun" with the other characters also performing urban legends, eventually having to receive advice from [[Marisa Kirisame]] on how to make her urban legend scarier. She seems genuinely happy that she was able to use her urban legend effectively, even if it was only on a single person.

Having purged herself of "worldly attachments," she's viewed as having achieved something akin to ''[[Wikipedia:Enlightenment_in_Buddhism|enlightenment]]'' by the Buddhists of the [[Myouren Temple]], although they question whether or not the price she paid was in her best interests.

===Abilities===
;Taking actions unconsciously
As her actions are controlled entirely by her unconscious, Koishi's presence cannot be noticed by other beings unless she allows it, even while standing in plain view because she's closed her mind, or her Third Eye. Likewise, her older sister's ability to read minds has no effect on her, as she does not technically have a mind to read; that's why she said, "my sister can't win against me." Even someone who manages to communicate with Koishi will forget about her after she leaves, unless they already knew of her as Satori's sister.

Some children are immune to this effect due to their still-developing minds, leading Koishi to become their "imaginary friend", though they will forget about her when they grow up.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]]'': [[Symposium of Post-mysticism/Koishi_Komeiji|Koishi Komeiji article]] - "A youkai invisible to adults, and only visible to certain children. However, even those who played with them in their childhood will completely forget that they existed once they grow up. Has anything like that ever happened to you? They are often referred to as 'imaginary friends'. Koishi is, no doubt, an imaginary friend."&lt;/ref&gt; Other than making others unable to perceive her existence, it also makes the act of doing so difficult to perceive. Practically, without being noticed by tengu or the other youkai, she climbed Youkai Mountain. However, as Satori's presence has been made generally known among the youkai of Gensokyo, Koishi has begun to be recognized by other residents as of late.

The youkai satori, on whom she and her older sister are based, by the actions of the humans' unconscious, they saw painful experiences. Due to this it is also not known if this ability was spoken of cynically in the past. However, since she closed her third eye which can read minds, she became unable to read others' minds. As she said herself, "reading people's minds is depressing, there's nothing good about it."

;Manipulation of the Unconscious
Koishi's presence cannot be "felt" by anyone unless she has entered their direct field of vision and is forgotten by most people as soon as she leaves it. She can manipulate the unconsciousness of every living thing around her, allowing her to make them see everything she desires &lt;ref&gt;''[[Double Spoiler]]'': Embryo's Dream - "They say the human embryo dreams in the mother's womb. What a scoop! The dreams' contents are...microbes, fish, and dinosaurs...they say."&lt;/ref&gt;  and make them confront their own weaknesses hidden inside their hearts, as seen in lot of her Spell Cards.

===Occupation===
Koishi currently resides at the [[Palace of the Earth Spirits]], but she is also a laywoman in regards to the [[Myouren Temple]] as a recent convert to [[Buddhism]], at [[Byakuren Hijiri]]'s request.

===Possessions===
Koishi wanted to receive the blessing of [[Kanako Yasaka]] so she could give her own pets power like Satori's pets were given, so Koishi does apparently have pets. During and after the events of ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'', Koishi now possesses the original [[Mask of Hope]] that once belonged to [[Hata no Kokoro]] before she lost it. Koishi found it while wandering around [[Gensokyo]], and because of this, she temporarily obtained the emotion of hope.

==Backstory==
To escape the fear and hatred which other beings feel towards the [[Satori (Species)|satori]] species, she attempted to destroy her mind-reading ability by closing her Third Eye. However, this had the side effect of sealing away her own conscious mind, causing her to lose all thoughts and motives; she could no longer be hated, but neither could she be loved, or even remembered by people who saw her.

==Character Design==
===Name===
{{nihongo|'''Koishi Komeiji'''|古明地 こいし}} is her full name. Her surname {{nihongo||古明地|Komeiji|lit. "ancient-bright earth"}} is an actual Japanese surname, seen mainly in the [[wikipedia:Yamanashi Prefecture|Yamanashi prefecture]]. There are two common ways to interpret her given name ''Koishi'', based on which kanji are used. The kanji in "{{lang|ja|恋思}}", though not a Japanese word as a compound, mean "will/thought of love." The second writing, "{{lang|ja|小石}}", means "little rock." This could be connected to her ability, indicating her lack of presence, as she is often compared to a little rock sitting on the side of the road in official texts.

The ending of Koishi's storyline in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'' suggests the origin for the name of Koishi. "Once hope is lost no one will be able to see her (Koishi) again, just like a small rock ({{lang|ja|小石}}, pronounced ''koishi'' as well) on the roadside."

===Design=== 
In ''[[Subterranean Animism]]'', Koishi has wavy, green or greyish, short hair and dark green eyes, wears a black hat with a yellow ribbon around it. A closed, blue-purplish "third eye" is positioned over her heart, with cords wrapped around her torso and attached to each of her ankles. She wears a yellow shirt with diamond-like blue buttons and dark green collar. The skirt is also green with a faint flowery pattern, but is lighter. Her socks are black. As of ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'', she has bright green hair and dark green eyes. Her "third eye" is also towards a purple colour.

Satori and Koishi's design may have been inspired by the 1939 painting by Frida Kahlo titled [http://arthistory.about.com/od/from_exhibitions/ig/frida_kahlo/fk200708_12.htm "The Two Fridas"]. The subject is essentially two identical women (sisters/clones/twins...) with visible hearts and external arteries that seem to connect and wrap around their shoulders and arms, where one of them has a cut artery and a pair of scissors in hands (resembling Koishi, who has closed her third eye).

==Appearances==
===Games===
;''Subterranean Animism''
[[File:Th11KoishiSprite.png|frame|Koishi's sprite in ''SA'']]
During the main events of the main scenario, it's said that Koishi was around the whole time the heroine was in the [[Underworld]], but they never noticed her. After the events of the main story in ''[[Subterranean Animism]]'', Koishi heard that her sister and pets fought a [[human]] from above ground, and also heard about [[Utsuho Reiuji]]'s new power. Desiring that kind of power for her own pets, she decided to go to [[Gensokyo]] to pray for divine blessings. Thanks to her unconscious ability, she managed to reach the [[Moriya Shrine]] atop of [[Youkai Mountain]] around the same time the Heroine decides to pay a visit to the [[God]]s in the Mountain in the game's Extra Stage. Koishi provokes a fight, and is defeated. After this encounter, however, Koishi somewhat regretted having closed her third eye and became curious enough to want to start actually meeting people.

;''Hopeless Masquerade''
:{{Main|Hopeless Masquerade/Story/Koishi's Scenario}}
Koishi tumbles across [[Hata no Kokoro]]'s lost [[Mask of Hope]] and picks it up. This bit of hope added to her otherwise emotionless state allows her to gather popularity when she would otherwise be invisible. She ends up so attached to the mask (unconsciously) that she refuses to return it to Kokoro and ends up keeping it after the conclusion of the story.

;''Urban Legend in Limbo''
:{{Main|Urban Legend in Limbo/Story/Koishi's Scenario}}
Unlike other characters from the cast, Koishi holds little interest for [[Occult Ball|Occult Balls]]. She instead tries to scare people with her own urban legend, based on Miss Mary. However, it doesn't work very well, which is not really surprising as the story is based on phone calls, and Gensokyo inhabitants are unfamiliar with such an event, due to the rarity of phones to be found. Koishi eventually ends up near the Hakurei Shrine, exactly when [[Sumireko Usami]] arrives in Gensokyo. As the latter comes from the [[Outside World]], she has a cellphone and knows the legend, and Koishi manages to scare her off Gensokyo this time.

;''Antinomy of Common Flowers''
In ''[[Antinomy of Common Flowers]]'', Koishi suddenly finds herself possessing [[Marisa Kirisame]]. Although neither seems to know how it happened, the duo decides to stick together and have fun with Perfect Possession. They wind up meeting the culprits of the incident, [[Joon Yorigami|Joon]] and [[Shion Yorigami]]. The disastrous sisters use their magic to exchange teammates and Koishi is stolen away and forced to fight against Marisa.

Koishi has a tendency to forcibly possess other characters and having no consciousness, she herself is easy to forcibly possess.

===Literature===
;''Symposium of Post-mysticism''
While talking about the underground [[youkai]], [[Byakuren Hijiri]] becomes interested in Koishi, as she thinks her state of mind – one of emptiness – is quite close to enlightenment. At the monk's request, Koishi converted to the [[Buddhism|Buddhist faith]].

==Relationships==
===[[Satori Komeiji]]===
Koishi's most important relationship is her older sister, Satori Komeiji. Despite Koishi closing her mind and seemingly whimsical wandering, as well as the fact that even Satori has trouble "seeing" her, Satori does worry about her.

===Minor Characters===
;[[Reimu Hakurei]] &amp; [[Marisa Kirisame]]
In Koishi's profile, it is said that she met a [[human]] at the [[Moriya Shrine]] at the top of the [[Youkai Mountain]] who made her regret closing her third eye and want to learn more about this human. Though it may seem like this was talking about [[Sanae Kochiya]], once put in to context by the extra stage of ''[[Subterranean Animism]]'', it is clear that the human it was talking about is either Reimu or Marisa.

;[[Rin Kaenbyou]] &amp; [[Utsuho Reiuji]]
Koishi is also acquainted with Satori's pets, which include Rin Kaenbyou and Utsuho Reiuji.

;[[Byakuren Hijiri]]
Byakuren has an optimistic view of Koishi's condition, believing that she is close to enlightenment, and invited her to attend [[Myouren Temple]] from time to time. Koishi accepted.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]]'': [[Symposium of Post-mysticism/Part 4|Part 4]]&lt;/ref&gt;

;[[Hata no Kokoro]]
Considered a nemesis by Kokoro due to Koishi stealing the [[Mask of Hope]].

==Additional Information==
*Koishi's musical theme, ''Hartmann's Youkai Girl'', may refer to [[wikipedia:Karl_Robert_Eduard_von_Hartmann|Eduard von Hartmann]] (whose most famous work is entitled ''The Philosophy of the Unconscious'') or [[wikipedia:Heinz_Hartmann|Heinz Hartmann]] (as many of Koishi's spell cards seem to make references to [[wikipedia:Ego_psychology|ego psychology]].) The track itself is also arranged so that it has symmetrical parts, making it sound remarkably similar to itself even when played reversed, possibly as a reference to the practice of backmasking.
*If her color scheme is inverted, she will somewhat resemble her sister Satori, and vice versa.
**One of her alternate costumes in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'' borrows her sister's color scheme.

　　彼女もさとり同様、心を読む妖怪であった。&lt;br/&gt;
　　しかし心を読む事で嫌われる事を知り、こいしは心を読む第三の眼を閉ざしてしまった。

　　それにより心を読む能力を失ったが、代わりに無意識で行動する事が出来る様になった。&lt;br/&gt;
　　地底の住人からは嫌われる事は無くなったが、同時に恐れられる事も動物たちに好かれる事も無くなった。

　　心を読む力は、自らの心の強さでもある。&lt;br/&gt;
　　それを嫌われるからと言って閉ざしてしまう事は、ただの逃げであり、結局は自らの心を閉ざしたのと変わらない。他人の心を受け入れないで完全にシャットダウンする事なのだ。


　　彼女は大した目的もなく、あちこちをフラフラ放浪するだけの妖怪となってしまった。彼女としては別にそれが楽しいのだから、何の問題もないのだが。周りから見ると少し可哀想にも見える。

　　姉のさとりも閉ざされたこいしの心だけは読む事は出来ず、いつも何処で何をしているのかよく判っていない。&lt;br/&gt;
　　ペットの猫のように遊んで帰ってきては、また遊びに出て行ってしまう。

　　さとりはそんなこいしを不憫に思い、最近ペットにこいしと遊ぶようにと命令し、何匹か専属のペットを与えた。&lt;br/&gt;
　　ペットを飼う事で少しずつ目的が生まれ、他の人の心を受け入れる事も出来る様になると考えていた。&lt;br/&gt;
　　少しずつだが、ペットを飼い始めてからこいしも変わってきた様だった。



　　今回は、地上から人間が降りてきて姉やおくう達と一悶着あったと聞き、中でもおくうの驚異的な能力アップが気になり、地上を目指す事にした。

　　無意識で行動する彼女は、誰にも気付かれることが無い。&lt;br/&gt;
　　地上に出ようと、寝ている巫女の脇を通り抜けようと、天狗が警備する山を通ろうと、誰一人彼女の気配に気付かないだろう。

　　それは都合の良い事もあるが、やはり少し寂しく見える。&lt;br/&gt;
　　しかし、寂しいと思う心も持ち合わせていなかったのである。&lt;br/&gt;


　　目的である山の上の神社で偶然出会った人間。その未知なる人間との出会いが彼女の心境に小さな変化をもたらした。&lt;br/&gt;
　　こんな面白い生き物が居るなんて、と思い、もっと目の前の生き物の事を知りたいと思った。このとき初めて、第三の眼を閉ざした事を後悔した。


　　　まず手始めに地底の地霊殿に招待しよう。&lt;br/&gt;
　　　お姉ちゃんやおくう、お燐とどんな戦いをしたのだろうか。&lt;br/&gt;
　　　今まで、どんな妖怪と戦ってきたのだろうか。&lt;br/&gt;
　　　尽きることのない話題を聞きたい。


　　そう思った時、こいしの第三の瞼が少し柔らかくなるのを感じた。

'''Komeiji Koishi'''

Species: [[Satori (Species)|Satori]]&lt;br/&gt;
Ability: Manipulating the Unconscious

Satori Komeiji's younger sister.&lt;br/&gt;
Like Satori, she was a youkai who has the ability to read others' minds.&lt;br/&gt;
However, knowing that people don't like having their minds read, Koishi closed her mind-reading third eye.&lt;br&gt;

As a result, she lost her ability to read others' minds, but in return she gained the ability to take action unconsciously.&lt;br&gt;
The denizens of the underground no longer hated her, but at the same time, they never feared her and animals no longer loved her.

The ability to read people's mind is the strength of one's own mind.&lt;br/&gt;
Closing off that ability because it's hated is just running away, and is no different from closing off one's own mind. It's effectively pushing away others' feelings and shutting down.


She became a youkai who wandered to and fro aimlessly. Personally, she thought it was fun, so it wasn't really a problem. People around her felt a little sorry for her.

Even her older sister, Satori, is unable to read Koishi's sealed-away mind, and doesn't really know where she goes or what she does there.&lt;br/&gt;
Just like a pet cat, she leaves and returns and leaves again according to her own whims.

Satori took pity on Koishi, ordering her pets to play with her and giving her some pets to keep as her own. She thought that taking care of the pets might give her a purpose, and it might enable her to begin opening her mind to others again. Indeed, it seemed that Koishi began to change, ever so slightly, after she began to raise her pets.



She heard that a human had come from above ground and had fought with her sister, Okuu, and the other pets, and was amazed at the incredible power-up Okuu had gotten, so she decided to go see the above ground world herself.

Because she could act unconsciously, she remained unnoticed. She could go above ground, sneak past sleeping &lt;!--armpit--&gt; shrine maidens, or go into the mountain the tengu guarded, and nobody would take notice of her.

In a way, it was convenient, but she was also lonely.&lt;br/&gt;
However, she had no mind capable of feeling this loneliness.


At her destination, the shrine atop the mountain, she happened to meet a human. Her meeting with this stranger changed her mental state ever so slightly.&lt;br/&gt;
She thought, how amazing it is to meet such an interesting person, and wanted to know more about her. For the first time, she regretted having closed her third eye.


　I'll start by inviting her underground to the Palace of the Earth Spirits.&lt;br/&gt;
　I wonder what kind of fight she had with my sister, Okuu, and Orin.&lt;br/&gt;
　I wonder what kind of youkai she's fought with.&lt;br/&gt;
　I want to hear her endless stories.


When she thought this, Koishi felt the lid of her third eye begin to shift a little.

{{nihongo|'''Komachi Onozuka'''|小野塚　小町|Onozuka Komachi}} is widely known in [[Gensokyo]] for being a slacker [[shinigami]] and a slow worker. She is [[Eiki Shiki, Yamaxanadu|Eiki Shiki]]'s subordinate. Her conversation topics often revolve around death, suicide, the afterlife, and other related horror, but considering the nature of her job, this is perhaps not surprising. In general, she's a rather carefree individual.

==General Information==
Komachi first appeared in ''[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]'' as a [[boss]] and playable character, later reprising both roles in ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]''. She was also a target on the final [[stage]] of ''[[Shoot the Bullet]]'' and appeared in the background of ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]''.

===Personality===
Komachi is known for being a slacker. She has a lazy, carefree personality and loves to talk, especially to the departed spirits she ferries across the [[Sanzu River]]. As a shinigami, Komachi is mildly antagonistic to people who outlive the regular life span ([[hermit]]s and [[celestial]]s for instance) and very antagonistic to those who destroy souls, phantoms, and other spirits.

Since Komachi is just a [[shinigami]] ferryman, it is not in her jurisdiction to take another person’s life. However, she won’t hesitate to threaten them with her scythe while issuing a warning, as seen in her interactions with [[Kasen Ibaraki]] and [[Tenshi Hinanawi]].

===Abilities===
;Manipulating distance
It is literally the ability to manipulate the space between her present location and the destination she's heading. She uses this ability to carry out her duty of ferrying spirits of the dead across the Sanzu River (although it is unknown whether other shinigami ferrymen also possess this power or not). This ability may be used to affect both literal distance (for example, changing the physical distance that exists between two points) and apparent distance (for example, making it seem like you never get any closer to, or farther away from, a location). The effects of this ability can be seen in [[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]], where Komachi uses it to restrict the enemies' movements.&lt;ref&gt;[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]] - '''''Path of Avici''''' skill card, '''''Hell "Narrow Confines of Avici''''' player Spell Card, '''''Death Sign "Scythe of Final Judgement''''' Story Mode Spell Card&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Komachi's official profile in ''Phantasmagoria of Flower View'' says that the width of the Sanzu River changes depending on her mood (which is presumably dictating how she uses her power), it is also mentioned in parts of the game's dialog (especially between [[Eiki Shiki, Yamaxanadu|Eiki]] and [[Sakuya Izayoi]]) that the width of the river is at least partially dependent upon the actual ghost being ferried.&lt;ref&gt;[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]: [[Phantasmagoria_of_Flower_View/Story/Sakuya's Scenario#Sakuya vs. Eiki (Episode Final)|Sakuya vs. Eiki (Episode Final)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

;Manipulating ghosts
Probably because of her status as a shinigami, Komachi is able to control departed spirits, and even talk with them.&lt;ref&gt;[[The_Grimoire_of_Marisa/Komachi_Onozuka's_Spell_Cards|The Grimoire of Marisa - Komachi Onozuka]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Wild and Horned Hermit]] - Chapter 46&lt;/ref&gt;

===Possessions===
;Scythe
Komachi posesses a scythe, which, aside from being a weapon, serves another, more subtle purpose. When the spirit of a recently deceased person arrives on the shores of the Sanzu, one of the first sights they behold is a figure carrying a large scythe. The spirit realizes, thanks to that tool, that they are looking at a shinigami; somehow, realizing that shinigami really do match their traditional image seems to reassure them, put them at ease, and come to terms with their fate more easily.&lt;ref&gt;[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]: [[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Shinigami]]&lt;/ref&gt;

;Coins
A liberal use of coinage is the hallmark of Komachi's [[danmaku]]. This money comes from the spirits of the dead, who pay the shinigami a toll to ferry them across it into [[Higan]]. The money for this toll comes about due to the connections they had with others while they were alive. More specifically, the toll is the total sum of the money used by others for one's sake during one's lifetime.

;Boat
The boat that Komachi uses (which she calls the ''[[Wikipedia:RMS Titanic|Titanic]]''&lt;ref&gt;[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]: [[Phantasmagoria of Flower View/Story/Reimu's Scenario#Reimu vs. Komachi (Episode_8)|Reimu vs. Komachi (Episode 8)]]&lt;/ref&gt;) to ferry souls is a special rowboat that can cross the Sanzu River, and is provided to her by [[Hell]] in order to carry out her duties. It is old and worn, but she is perhaps unable to procure a new one due to Hell's current poor financial situation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]: [[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Komachi Onozuka]]&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, [[Touhou Hisoutensoku/Spell Cards/Komachi Onozuka|a few of her spell cards]] in ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]'' make use of this boat on land.

==Character Design==
[[File:PMiSS_komachi.jpg|thumb|160px||Komachi's portrait in ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'']]
===Name===
Her full name is {{nihongo|''Komachi Onozuka''|小野塚　小町}}. {{nihongo||小町|Komachi}} contains the characters that means "small" and "town," an uncommonly used term that is roughly equivalent to "the town beauty". {{nihongo||小野塚|Onozuka}} is written to contain the characters "small", "field", and "mound". Komachi's name is extremely similar to that of [[Wikipedia:Ono no Komachi|Ono no Komachi]], a famous Heian-era ''[[Wikipedia:Waka (poetry)|waka]]'' poet, with the main difference being that the poet's name lacks the kanji {{nihongo||塚|zuka}}. There is a famous legend regarding Ono no Komachi's grandfather, [[Wikipedia:Ono no Takamura|Ono no Takamura]], which claimed that at night, he would descend into Hell via a well, and aid the Yama in passing judgement.

===Design===
In both ''[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]'''s and ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s official art, Komachi has red eyes and short pinkish-red hair with two ponytails tied by two double hair beads. She wears a white dress underneath a blue vest, and has an obi with a large coin tied in the center. She also carries a scythe with a wispy ripple at the end of its blade.

Her alternative outfit in ''Phantasmagoria of Flower View'' is the same as her usual outfit, except her hair beads are yellow, and her vest is green. Her alternative outfit in ''Scarlet Weather Rhapsody'' is the same as her usual outfit, except her dress is red instead of blue, and she has pink hair.

==Appearances==
===Games===
;''Phantasmagoria of Flower View''
[[File:Th09KomachiSprite.png|frame|left|Komachi's sprite in ''PoFV'']]
[[File:Th09KomachiBackSprite.png|frame|right|Komachi's back sprite in ''PoFV'']]
:{{Main|Phantasmagoria of Flower View/Story#Komachi's Story|l1=Phantasmagoria of Flower View Story}}
When the "flower incident" first occurred, she wasn't particularly bothered or worried about it. Instead, she simply carried on at her usual pace, occasionally even running away from work at times. Because of this, the huge quantity of spirits that arrived on the banks of the [[Sanzu River]] were not brought across the river to stand before the [[Yama]]. This in turn led to flowers of every season blooming as they became possessed by these unjudged souls.

She is the penultimate [[boss]] for most of the Story Mode scenarios in the game, and is an unlockable playable character. Unlike most of the other playable characters' scenarios, however, Komachi's scenario is set up as an Extra stage, where she starts with 0 extra lives and all fights are deathmatches; both her and the opponent have half a health dot to start with.

===Spin-offs===
;''Shoot the Bullet''
In ''[[Shoot the Bullet]]'', [[Aya Shameimaru]] encountered Komachi on the final [[stage]] and took photos of her [[danmaku]].

;''Scarlet Weather Rhapsody''
:{{Main|Scarlet Weather Rhapsody/Story#Komachi's Story|l1=Scarlet Weather Rhapsody Story}}
In [[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]], Komachi is on her "free time" as she wonders about the sudden changes in weather until [[Youmu Konpaku|Youmu]] informs her that someone is killing ghosts in order to manipulate the temperaments. She begins her "work" at the [[Bamboo Forest of the Lost]] before she goes to investigate the Hakurei Shrine's condition, where [[Tenshi Hinanawi]] appears to keep her promise to [[Reimu Hakurei]] of rebuilding the Shrine. She calls out Tenshi's immortality as a sham and states that her lifespan is already over before challenging her to a battle. Although Tenshi was defeated in the battle, Komachi is unable to send her to the Netherworld as she is simply a ferry guide shinigami rather than a reaper.

;''Hopeless Masquerade''
[[File:Th135Komachi.png|frame|Komachi in ''HM'']]
Komachi make a background cameo appearance in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'' on the [[Divine Spirit Mausoleum]] stage. She is seen sleeping.

===Literature===
[[File:WaHHKomachiAppearance.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Komachi appearance in ''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'' Chapter 12]]
;''Wild and Horned Hermit''

In ''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'' Komachi often visits [[Kasen Ibara]] in her mansion to chat about various topics, as the arrival of a [[Seiga Kaku|problematic hermit]], lifespans, of any other event that is happening at the moment, as the Setsubun. At the end, she helps [[Tenshi Hinanawi]] to enter Kasen's house so that Tenshi could enter Avici and rescue [[Reimu Hakurei]].

;''Strange and Bright Nature Deity''
In chapter 4 of ''[[Strange and Bright Nature Deity]]'' Komachi is in Muenzuka taking a break when she spots the [[Three Fairies of Light|three fairies]] and chats with them about the decreasing number of ghosts that year.

;''Symposium of Post-mysticism''
Komachi makes a cameo in the third part of ''[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]]'', where [[Minamitsu Murasa]] was pouring water into her ferry. [[Kanako Yasaka]] makes note of this during the symposium.

;Lotus Eaters

==Relationships==
;[[Eiki Shiki, Yamaxanadu]] 
She is [[Eiki Shiki, Yamaxanadu|Eiki]]'s subordinate and is often scolded for her laid-back lifestyle and work ethic.

;[[Tenshi Hinanawi]]
Komachi may have a grudge against Tenshi for how Tenshi flaunts her status of celestial, which Komachi feels is undeserved. The extent of this isn't known as no other game or manga touch upon this besides ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]'' and ''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]''.

;[[Kasen Ibaraki]]
Their interactions when Komachi visits Kasen are mildly antagonistic, but this doesn't stop Komachi from trying to give Kasen advice or information, including info on the [[Kishin]], who are actually sent after those that live too long.

;Other Relationships
She is also seen chatting with the souls of the departed as she ferries them across the [[Sanzu River]].

==Additional Information==
*The Last Word theme in ''[[Imperishable Night]]'', {{nihongo||東方妖怪小町|Touhou Youkai Komachi}}, contains the exact kanji ({{lang|ja|小町}}) used in her name.
*In ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]'', she mentions the idea of having a notebook that brought death to anyone whose name was written in it. This is an unsubtle reference to the titular possession of shinigami in the manga ''[[Wikipedia:Death Note|Death Note]]''.
*One of Komachi's win quotes in ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]'' has her saying that her eyes allow her to see how long someone will live. She goes on to offer to trade her eye for half her opponent's remaining lifespan.&lt;ref&gt;[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]: [[Phantasmagoria of Flower View/Story/Komachi's Script#Komachi defeats someone|Komachi defeats someone]]&lt;/ref&gt; This is a blatant ''Death Note'' reference. Furthermore, it is directly contradicted in ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Shinigami|Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'', which states that there are shinigami in the [[Perfect_Memento_in_Strict_Sense/Yama|Ministry of Right and Wrong]] whose specific ''job'' is measuring and calculating lifespans.

'''Komachi Onozuka'''

Species: [[Shinigami]]&lt;br /&gt;
Ability: Manipulating distance

A [[youkai]] that provides passage for the [[sanzu river|river]] between [[Gensokyo]] and [[Higan]].&lt;br /&gt;
She has the ability to manipulate distance.

When a person dies, their spirit will cross the river. Komachi lectures the dead on how to cross it. The width and depth of the river changes depending on her mood. Also, if someone has done too much evil during their lifetime, they may even not be able to cross the river.

A shinigami judges one to be good or bad not by the amount of crimes, but by money. That is to say, not the money that the deceased may have had while they were alive, but rather the total amount of those who yearned and missed that person from the bottom of their hearts. By the way, judging the amount of crimes of the dead is not Komachi's job and would be handled after crossing the river, but that's a story for another time.

After death, when she requests a passage fee from them, people tend to be surprised since the money they have on hand doesn't correspond to their own assets, but on the assets of his or her surrounding friends.

Very rich people tend to be despised during their life, and are astonished to see how little they have after death.

Komachi always demands those she guides to pay all the money they have, and anyone who hesitates to pay the full sum is dropped into the river midway through the journey. The river is made infinitely wide, and the unfortunate spirit is soon consumed by huge fishes and water dragon which were extinct in world of the living.

The reason [[Gensokyo]] got buried under a sea of flowers this time was because her workload went way beyond what she could handle. There were so many dead spirits that some of them were not handled in time and were left in Gensokyo, and in this puzzled state these dead spirits possessed nearby flowers.

Komachi thought that it was just a temporary issue, and worked at her own pace without the slightest bit of worry. However, it soon caught the eye of her boss, [[Eiki Shiki, Yamaxanadu|Eiki]], and she got a good scolding because of that.

'''Konngara''' is a being that [[Reimu Hakurei]] encounters at [[Hell]]'s Silent Shrine in ''[[Highly Responsive to Prayers]]''. Konngara is the final enemy Reimu confronts before returning to her shrine in the Hell route of the game. Due to Konngara's lack of dialogue, little is known about them. Like most other characters from ''Highly Responsive to Prayers'', Konngara's gender is unknown.

==Character Design==
===Name===
There is no official [[wikipedia:Kana|kana]] of Konngara, but it can be unofficially written as "{{lang|ja|矜羯羅}}", which may be a reference to an attendant of the Fudoo Myoo-oo, the Japanese name for the Wisdom King Acala ([[Wikipedia:Sanskrit|Sanskrit]]: {{lang|sk|अचल}}) in [[Wikipedia:Shingon Buddhism|Shingon Buddhism]]. Fudoo Myoo-oo is a violent figure who burns away material desire with his flames. He is often depicted with fire, a sword, and attendants "Konngara Dōji" and "Seitaka Dōji", who are sometimes considered part of Fudoo Myoo-oo's "Eight Great Youths". This relates to Konngara's pose.

"Konngara" may also refer to numerical value equivalent to 10 to the exponent of 112.

===Design===
Konngara's sprite has red eyes, black hair, a red ribbon, and a large sword. They wear red robes with white trim and grey sleeves. They also have what seems to be either a horn or a spike impaled through their forehead. They appear to be holding a cup of some sort in their other hand.
Konngara is also one of the only PC-98 characters whose hair and eyes are not the same color. The only other PC-98 characters with differently colored hair and eyes are [[Elis]] and [[SinGyoku]]'s "male" form. This is due to the PC-98's 16-color limit.

==Gallery==
&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Th01KonngaraGreen.png|Konngara's fight in green.
&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Additional Information==
*At least one text refers to the figure Konngara Dōji as a yaksha, which are quasi-deities of a generally benevolent but sometimes malevolent character, explaining why one might be banished to Hell. See JAANUS link [http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/deta/k/kongaradouji.htm here].
*[[Meira]] and Konngara are similarly designed. They also share a single kanji in their names ({{lang|ja|羅}}), which means either "silk" or "gauze" or "Latin".
*Konngara is the only [[PC-98]] character who shows different facial expressions during a boss fight.
*If the player repeatedly pauses and unpauses the game during Konngara's battle, anything red on-screen will occasionally become green.

{{nihongo|'''Konohana-Sakuyahime'''|木花 咲耶姫}}, also referred to as '''Sakuyahime''' for short, is a [[Wikipedia:Shinto|Shinto]] goddess who appears in Chapter 4 of ''Cage in Lunatic Runagate'', in a flashback told by [[Fujiwara no Mokou]].

==General Information==
===Personality===

==Character Design==
===Origin===
In Japanese mythology, {{nihongo|[[Wikipedia:Konohanasakuya-hime|Konohana-no-Sakuyahime]]|木花之開耶姫}} is the goddess of [[Wikipedia:Mount Fuji|Mount Fuji]] and the daughter of the mountain god [[Wikipedia:Ohoyamatsumi|Ohoyamatsumi]]. She is the blossom-princess and symbol of delicate earthly life whose image is that of the [[Wikipedia:sakura|sakura]].

The wife of [[Wikipedia:Ninigi-no-Mikoto|Ninigi-no-Mikoto]], they met at the seashore and fell in love. Ninigi asked Sakuyahime's father for her hand in marriage, but his other daughter, the rock-princess Iwanagahime, was offered instead. Ninigi refused, and Ohoyamatsumi relented. Ninigi taking Sakuyahime instead of Iwanagahime is said to be the reason why human lives are short and fleeting, like sakura blossoms, rather than enduring and long-lasting.

===Name===
{{stub|section}}
Her full name in the Touhou series is {{nihongo|Konohana-Sakuyahime|木花 咲耶姫}}.

The way her name is written in Tohuou differs from how it is written in folklore. In folklore, her name is usually written as {{nihongo|Konohana-Sakuyahime|木花咲耶姫}} or {{nihongo|Konohana-no-Sakuyahime|木花開耶姫}}.

She is also sometimes called {{nihongo|Sengen|浅間}}. This name was originally read as Asama, which means volcano.

===Design===
Sakuyahime has long (at least hip-length) dark hair.

==Sakuyahime's Appearances==
;''Curiosities of Lotus Asia''
:{{Main|Curiosities of Lotus Asia/Chapter 25|l1=Curiosities of Lotus Asia Chapter 25}}

Konohana-Sakuyahime is first mentioned in Curiosities of Lotus Asia. Rinnosuke mentions her as not only the goddess of mountains, but of sake.

;''Cage in Lunatic Runagate''
:{{Main|Cage in Lunatic Runagate/Fourth Chapter|l1=Cage in Lunatic Runagate Chapter 4}}

According to [[Keine Kamishirasawa|Keine]], she is a water deity who calms volcanoes, originally read as Lady Asama, and then Lady Sengen. Her older sister was Princess Iwanagahime, the God of immortality, who resided on Mount Yatsugatake, or [[Youkai Mountain]].

At some point, as said by Keine, there was a contest to see which was higher, Fuji or Yatsugatake. Yatsugatake won, but Sakuyahime couldn't stand there being a mountain higher than hers, so she broke apart Yatsugatake. However, since Iwanagahime was tired of her sister's attitude, she moved to Yatsugatake, causing Fuji's inextinguishable flame to disappear since Iwanagahime had control of the unchanging.

Years later, following orders from the Emperor, [[Iwakasa]] and his men were to dispose of the [[Hourai Elixir]] by flinging it into the mouth of Mount Fuji. However, while being followed by [[Fujiwara no Mokou]], Sakuyahime appeared before Iwakasa, and warned them not to do so, for it would cause Fuji to become active again. They spent the night on the mountain, but Sakuyahime awoke Mokou and Iwakasa and claimed that the men had started killing each other over the elixir, although Mokou speculated to Keine that she thought Sakuyahime had killed them herself. Sakuyahime directed them toward Iwanagahime on Yatsugatake, which was more equipped to deal with the Hourai Elixir, but with Sakuyahime's words ringing in her head, Mokou robbed and supposedly killed Iwakasa halfway down Fuji.

;''Wild and Horned Hermit''
Sakuyahime is briefly mentioned in Wild and Horned Hermit, where she is referred to as the main god of sake.

==Relationships==
===[[Iwanagahime]]===
Sakuyahime is the younger sister of Iwanagahime.

===Minor Relationships===
;[[Fujiwara no Mokou]] and [[Iwakasa]]
Sakuyahime met Moukou and Iwakasa during the events described by Moukou's flashback in Cage in Lunatic Runagate, Chapter 4.

==Additional Information==
* Today, there are many [[Wikipedia:Asama shrine|Asama shrines]] (around 1300) dedicated to Mount Fuji and Konohana-no-Sakuyahime.

{{nihongo|'''Kosuzu Motoori'''|本居 小鈴|Motoori Kosuzu}} is the main protagonist of ''[[Forbidden Scrollery]]''. She is a [[Human Village]] resident and a worker at the [[Suzunaan]] [[wikipedia:Kashi-hon|book renter]]. According to her, she's the No.1 collector of the [[demon book]]s in [[Gensokyo]].

==General Information==
===Personality===
Kosuzu has a sweet personality, considerate and optimistic, polite and cheerful with her customers and her friends, and enjoys telling stories to village children. However, she is very confident in herself and her abilities, which frequently gets her into trouble. She thinks she knows better than most other people, distrusting [[Reimu Hakurei|Reimu]] and often taking matters into her own hands, with disastrous consequences. She's highly curious, and often dangerously so, being unafraid to read and make use of the [[Demon book|Demon books]] she owns, even after learning that they contain the power of youkai, and goes to many different measures to acquire information.

Despite this confidence, she can be quite cowardly as well. She develops a temporary fear of snakes after hearing a rumor that they can eat a human whole, and gets worked up over a horror story she hears from a pair of children, even after dismissing it as illogical. She's also prone to fainting when startled, whether it be in a dangerous situation or even if it's actually something benign.

Kosuzu is very conflicted over how she should feel about youkai. While [[Hieda no Akyuu]], her good friend, and Reimu warn her that youkai are not to be trusted, she is on good terms with [[Aya Shameimaru]] and [[Mamizou Futatsuiwa]], both of whom she is aware are youkai, and have never attempted to hurt her. She wants a definite answer over whether or not youkai are her friends or foes, and wants to understand her purpose in Gensokyo, but the conflicting opinions of her various friends cause her great frustration, and she struggles to form her own.

Once the true relationship between youkai and humans is explained to Kosuzu at the end of ''Forbidden Scrollery'', she reacts with excitement and expresses interest in one day participating in danmaku duels.

===Abilities===
;Ability to decipher books by only touching them

At the beginning of ''Forbidden Scrollery'', Kosuzu had recently gained the ability to decipher any sort of text, no matter what language it is written in, just by touching it. Despite her ability, she appears to have difficulty writing in other languages (for example, English), so it appears her ability only applies to reading, or only partially applies to writing. Additionally, her ability fails to work if the text has been mirrored (such as on a woodblock used for printing).
;Ability to read youkai auras

By chapter 16 of ''Forbidden Scrollery'', Kosuzu's deciphering ability had improved to the point where she could "read between the lines" by sensing the energies and emotions imprinted in writing, allowing her to detect [[demon books]] and helping her to distinguish real texts from forgeries. [[Hieda no Akyuu]] theorises that Kosuzu gained this ability from prolonged exposure to [[demon books]].

===Occupation===
Kosuzu is a part-timer that works at [[Suzunaan]], a library specializing in books that appeared in [[Gensokyo]] from the [[outside world]]. She lends books to various characters throughout her manga. 

===Possessions===
Kosuzu claims to have the largest collection of [[demon book]]s in all of Gensokyo stored in the library she works at. It's essentially her pet project and hobby.

==Backstory==
Not much is known about Kosuzu's past, but she appears to have known [[Reimu Hakurei]] and [[Marisa Kirisame]] for at least some time. At some point she started working part-time in the library Suzunaan.

==Character Design==
===Name===
Her full name is {{nihongo|''Kosuzu Motoori''|本居 小鈴}}. Her surname {{nihongo||本居|Motoori}} literally means "residing books" while her given name {{nihongo||小鈴|Kosuzu}} means "little bell". 

She is very likely a reference to [[wikipedia:Motoori Norinaga|Norinaga Motoori]], a prominent 18th century Japanese scholar in [[wikipedia:Kokugaku|Kokugaku]] (ancient Japanese literature study) - his greatest achievement was deciphering the [[wikipedia:Kojiki|Kojiki]]. Norigana was also known to love old bells very much, which is called "&lt;b&gt;kosuzu&lt;/b&gt;" ({{lang|ja|古鈴}}) in Japanese.

===Design===
Kosuzu is a young girl with red eyes, light red hair and twintails adorned with bells. She wears a checkered kimono and apron with Kosuzu and {{nihongo|鈴奈庵|Suzunaan}} written on the front. She uses glasses to read. When she goes outdoors she'll wear a coat.

==Appearances==
[[File:Th135Kosuzu.png|frame]]
===Spin-offs===
; Hopeless Masquerade 
Kosuzu made her first game appearance in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'' as a background character on the [[Human Village]] stage. She can be seen with a broom watching the fights that happen in this game behind all the other [[human]]s.

===Literature===
;[[Forbidden Scrollery]]
Kosuzu is the main protagonist of Forbidden Scrollery. She recently gained the power to decipher all writing, though it hasn't yet been explained how. She was responsible for letting loose a smoke [[youkai]] called [[Enenra]] in an attempt to smoke out a word-eating worm youkai. Her reading of the [[Night Parade Picture Scroll]] caused objects around the village to transform into [[tsukumogami]] at night, though once this was traced to her she began restricting her reading to once per month to avoid suspicion. After attending [[Hata no Kokoro]]'s performance at the Hakurei Shrine, an old scroll lead Kosuzu to deduce (correctly) that Kokoro is a youkai and (incorrectly) that [[Reimu]] was helping her steal emotions, though [[Mamizou]] managed to convince her that Reimu was being tricked and that the menreiki's next play would be under proper supervision.

==Relationships==
===Family===
Kosuzu is known to have a family. On several occasions, she'd talk or yell to her parents in the shop, but they were always off-panel. One example is the beginning of chapter 13 where she asks her mother if she knew where her shoes were. She also made reference to her [[Minor Characters#Kosuzu's Grandfather|grandfather]], in which he was the one who taught Kosuzu about the "word-eating worm", but it's unknown if he's still alive.

===Mamizou Futatsuiwa===
A regular patron of the store in her human disguise, [[Mamizou Futatsuiwa]] speaks to Kosuzu in a friendly manner and offers her advice on supernatural matters. While Reimu frequently warns Kosuzu of the dangers of interacting with [[youkai]] artifacts, Mamizou has no such compunctions and merely advises her to keep her hobbies secret so that people like Reimu won't take her books away. Unaware of Mamizou's true nature for most of the story, Kosuzu looks up to her as a role model, seemingly trusting her more than any other adult.

===Hieda no Akyuu===
[[Hieda no Akyuu]] is Kosuzu's closest friend, and the two often meet to discuss books and strange happenings. Kosuzu is noticably more casual and outspoken around Akyuu than while speaking to her elders like Reimu and Marisa.

===Minor Relationships===
;[[Reimu Hakurei]]
Kosuzu seems to know and respect Reimu very well, speaking to her in a friendly and polite manner. However, she has heard the rumours of the [[Hakurei Shrine]] being infested by youkai and it sometimes colours how she interprets Reimu's actions. Reimu addresses Kosuzu as "Kosuzu-chan".
;[[Marisa Kirisame]]
Kosuzu is friendly with Marisa, but does not appear to know her as well as Reimu.
;[[Aya Shameimaru]]
Kosuzu and Aya have become business partners in the selling of the Bunbunmaru Newspaper for the [[Human Village]].

==Additional Information==
*The logo of Suzunaan, Kosuzu's shop is a turnip (you can find it in {{nihongo|庵}} on the graphic design of title logo of Forbidden Scrollery). It should be derived from the fact that a traditional name of turnip is &lt;b&gt;suzu&lt;/b&gt;na ({{nihongo|菘}} / {{nihongo|鈴菜}}), which is also used these days when they celebrate [[Wikipedia:Japanese_calendar#Seasonal_festivals|new-year festival]] as one of the [[Wikipedia:Nanakusa-no-sekku|special seven vegetables of spring]], but is normally called "kabu" ({{nihongo|カブ}} / {{nihongo|蕪}}). 
**This vegetable also appears in the [http://www.norinagakinenkan.com/norinaga/kaisetsu/onraizu.html {{nihongo|恩頼図}}] ("onrai-zu" or "mitama-no fuyu-no e". It means "the graph of influence".), drawn by the adopted child of Norinaga. This turnip-like picture explains graphically the lineage of Norinaga's Japanese Study; Norinaga stands in the center, the upper part lists the names of people who affected Norinaga, and the lower does those who are affected by him. 
*In chapters 10 and 11, Kosuzu uses a kimono with a hat that resembles the famous fictional Japanese detective [[wikipedia:Kosuke Kindaichi|Kosuke Kindaichi]] created by Seishi Yokomizo.

{{nihongo|'''Kotohime'''|小兎姫}} is a [[PC-98]] character who supposed to be a princess, but has an odd personality. Everyone who meets her thinks there's something slightly weird about her, even if those people are strange themselves. She also calls herself a police officer, is a collector of things only she thinks are interesting and doesn't go out much. She's one of the many playable characters in ''[[Phantasmagoria of Dim.Dream]]''

==Character Design==
===Name===
Her full name is {{nihongo|''Kotohime''|小兎姫}}, which means "little [[rabbit]] princess".

===Design===
Kotohime's design shows that she has red hair and eyes, a purple kimono with red flower markings, and has a yellow bow in her hair. Her alternate outfit is the same, except her hair and eyes are purple, and her kimono is red with purple flower markings.

==Appearances==
;''Phantasmagoria of Dim.Dream''
:{{Main|Phantasmagoria_of_Dim.Dream/Story#Kotohime.27s_Ending|l1=Phantasmagoria of Dim.Dream Story}}
In ''[[Phantasmagoria of Dim.Dream]]'', should she be the victor and recipient of [[Yumemi Okazaki]]'s wish, she locks [[Reimu Hakurei]] in a jail cell under the pretense of being a police officer.

==Additional Information==
*Kotohime appears on the cover of ''[[Phantasmagoria of Dim.Dream]]'' along with all the other characters in that game.
*Kotohime is one of the few [[PC-98]] characters who has a full in-game portrait. (The portrait appears when she is casting a special attack.)

A princess who's always a little bit "off". Since her personality is something of failure, she doesn't get out to meet people often, so no one really knows what she's like. Except that, as a proprietor of feelings most people don't have, she's something of a collector of things normal people don't find interesting.

In other words, she's a (genuine) collection freak.

I wonder why she's going to the ruins this time. (Could be just on a whim.)

{{nihongo|'''Kurumi'''|くるみ}} is a [[vampire]] and the [[gatekeeper]] to the entrance of the [[Lake of Blood]] at the center of a mountain. During ''[[Lotus Land Story]]'', she is defeated by both [[Reimu Hakurei]] and [[Marisa Kirisame]] on their way to [[Mugenkan]]. Why she guards the entrance to the lake, and the "gate" she is referring to, are unknown.

==Character Design== 
===Design===
In ''[[Lotus Land Story]]'''s official art, Kurumi has yellow eyes, long yellow hair, and has a white bow in her hair. She wears a white shirt and red suspenders and has a red bow over her chest. She also has large purple wings.

==Appearances==
;''Lotus Land Story''
:{{Main|Lotus Land Story/Story|l1=Lotus Land Story Story}}
The main character meets Kurumi as the guardian of the lake. She said that she has defeated all the intruders who tried to enter the lake (at least up until the events of ''[[Lotus Land Story]]''). She was easily defeated by either [[Reimu Hakurei]] or [[Marisa Kirisame]]. On the third stage of ''Lotus Land Story'', Reimu or Marisa, depending on which character the player is using, entered [[Mugenkan]] before the other character. Presumably, they must have passed Kurumi somehow.

==Relationships==
Kurumi is not seen interacting with anyone outside of the player character.

==Additional Information==
*[[Sylphid]] (from ''[[Project Blank]]'') uses some attacks that are very similar to Kurumi's "wall explosions".
*[[Nazrin]]'s first spell card resembles one of Kurumi's attacks.
*Kurumi's the only [[PC-98]] boss to serve as her own midboss.
*With the exception of [[Reimu Hakurei]] and [[Marisa Kirisame]], [[Elly]] (who is the guard of [[Mugenkan]]) hadn't fought for a long time preceding the events of ''[[Lotus Land Story]]''. This may be because Kurumi possibly defeated all intruders prior to both Reimu and Marisa's arrival.

{{nihongo|'''Kutaka Niwatari'''|庭渡 久侘歌|Niwatari Kutaka}} is a god of chickens and a guard of [[Hell]]. She lives in a spring atop the [[Youkai Mountain]] but goes to [[Higan]] for her job of overseeing the gateway to otherworlds such as Hell under the [[yama]]'s oversight. &lt;ref name="WBaWCP"&gt; ''[[Wily Beast and Weakest Creature]]'' - Kutaka's Profile &lt;/ref&gt;

==General Information==
Kutaka first appeared as the stage 3 midboss and [[Boss|boss]] in ''[[Wily Beast and Weakest Creature]]'', attempting to dissuade the protagonist from entering [[Hell]]. She also appears as the extra stage midboss.

===Personality===
Kutaka has called herself birdbrained. When she was told not to put too much trust in the animal spirits, she stated she forgot the details when asked.&lt;ref&gt; ''[[Wily Beast and Weakest Creature]]'' - [[Wily Beast and Weakest Creature/Story/Reimu's Scenario (Eagle)|Reimu's Scenario (Eagle)]] &lt;/ref&gt; She also tells the protagonists that, to her, it wouldn't really matter what would happen to them, as she would've forgotten all about them by that point anyway. She speaks in a polite, somewhat refined manner, and despite already being authorized to let the protagonists through, she takes extra care to test their strength out of concern for their well-being.

===Abilities===
;Healing throat illnesses
Kutaka's stated ability. The extent or how the ability works is unknown. 

===Occupation===
Kutaka is the guard of the checkpoint leading to various Otherworlds, such as Hell and the land of oni. Her job is to distinguish betwen humans and oni, and sort them into their respective locations.&lt;ref name="WBaWCP"/&gt; If someone wants to enter [[Hell]], they must have Kutaka's permission to do so. If they don't have it, Kutaka will ask them to return to their original world.

==Character Design==
===Origin===
Kutaka is based on {{nihongo|''Niwatarijin''|ニワタリ神}}, a god based in rural folklore who is worshipped in many shrines throughout northeastern Japan. Niwatarijin is typically depicted as a god of agriculture, fertility, irrigation and/or safe passage, and is at times associated with chickens (''niwatori'') and the sacrifice thereof. One of the god's notable blessings is to cure children's [[wikipedia:Whooping_cough|whooping cough]], which was associated with birds and locally referred to as ''tori-shabiki''.

Wide variation exists in the name of the god and its shrines, both in terms of spelling and pronunciation. Variants include ''Niwatari/Niwatashi'' ({{lang|ja|庭渡, 二渡, 二羽渡, 仁和多利, 荷渡}}), ''Oniwatari/Oniwatashi'' ({{lang|ja|鬼渡}}), ''Newatari'' ({{lang|ja|根渡, 子渡}}), and ''Miwatari/Miwatashi'' ({{lang|ja|水渡, 新渡, 見渡, 美渡, 御渡}}). Various theories exist regarding which name or meaning came first, though no conclusive answer has been reached. Some shrines were originally referred to with the Buddhist terms ''Myoujin'' and ''Gongen'', and were renamed to ''"jinja"'' in the Meiji era. Many of the shrines were also dedicated to gods from Japanese mythology at this time in addition to Niwatarijin, including water gods such as {{nihongo|''Ame no Mikumari no Kami''|天水分神}} or {{nihongo|''Kuni no Mikumari no Kami''|国水分神}}.

Kutaka's role as a gatekeeper of Hell is likely drawn from the ''"Oniwatari"'' name variant. The characters "{{lang|ja|鬼渡}}" (oniwatari) mean "passage through [[Oni|oni]]", or "battle with oni" as in the verb ''"watari-au"'' ({{lang|ja|渡り合う}}, "to do combat with").

===Name===
Her full name is {{nihongo|''Kutaka Niwatari''|庭渡 久侘歌}}. ''Kutaka'' is spelled with the characters ''ku'' ({{lang|ja|久}}), meaning "a long time", ''ta'' ({{lang|ja|侘}}), which means "proud" in Chinese and "lonesome" in Japanese, and ''ka'' ({{lang|ja|歌}}), meaning "song". The name may be derived from ''"kutakake"'', an archaic word for "chicken". Though it was originally a derisive term, with ''"kake"'' meaning "chicken" and ''"kuta"'' meaning "rotten", it eventually came to be viewed as a refined term owing to its archaic nature. (Incidentally, "kutaka" is also Swahili for "wanting".)

''Niwatari'' is taken directly from one of several names for Niwatarijin's shrines, spelled with the characters ''niwa'' ({{lang|ja|庭}}), meaning "courtyard", and ''watari'' ({{lang|ja|渡}}), meaning "to pass through". Relatedly, the word ''"niwatori"'' (chicken) is derived from ''"niwatsu-torikake"'' ({{lang|ja|庭つ鳥かけ}}), meaning "domestic ''kake'' kept in the courtyard".

===Design===
Kutaka wears a brown dress under a short white jacket. Her jacket has an orange Puritan collar, over which she wears a red ribbon that resembles a rooster's [[wikipedia:Wattle_(anatomy)|wattle]]. She wears long brown boots. She has fluffy yellow wings and a bushy, feathery tail. She has red eyes and a light tan. Her hair is cut short and light yellow in color. On top of her head is a red nest-like extension, which is apparently host to a tiny chick. Her pose in her portrait art is a reference to a statue of [https://i0.wp.com/drivejapan.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/fullsizeoutput_2333.jpeg Mekhila] in the Buddhist temple [https://drivejapan.net/temples-of-nara-park/ Shin-Yakushi-ji] of Nara, Japan. Mekhila is one of the Heavenly Generals and guardians of the Buddha Bhaisajyaguru. The Heavenly Generals representing the 12 Chinese Zodiacs and Mekhila is the Rooster, just like Kutaka is the chicken god.

==Appearances==
===Games===
[[File:Th17KutakaSprite.png|frame|right|Kutaka's sprite in ''[[Wily Beast and Weakest Creature|WBaWC]]'']]
;''Wily Beast and Weakest Creature''
Kutaka approaches the protagonist as she enters the gateway to [[Hell]], claiming that she has heard of her from the [[Yama]]. Although given permission to let the outsider in, she defends the gate anyway to test whether they can really survive Hell. She relents and lets them through upon being defeated, though not without a warning about the trustworthiness of their beast spirit partner.

She later returns in the Extra stage, once again trying to dissuade the protagonist from entering hell due to the coastal operations being carried out to contain [[Saki Kurokoma]] from attacking the surface.
[[File:Th175KutakaSprite.gif|thumb|frame|left|90px|Kutaka's sprite in ''GI'']]
===Spin-offs===
;''Touhou Gouyoku Ibun''
Kutaka was in the [[Hell of Blazing Fires]] investigating the incident about the [[Sanzu River]] overflowing. 

If the player uses with [[Kanako Yasaka]] or [[Marisa Kirisame]], Kutaka will think that they are the culprits and will attack them, but afterwars she will let them continue to check the reactor or to keep investigating the “black water”, respectively.

If the player uses with [[Joon]] and [[Shion Yorigami]], the goddesses will attack her thinking they will be caugh, and after being defeated she will explain that she doesn’t care about it at all, and will let them pass.

If the player uses [[Flandre Scarlet]], the vampire will suddenly attack her, and after defeating her she will leave using a backdoor, which leaves Kutaka really confused.

==Relationships==

Kutaka Niwatari&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Species: God&lt;br /&gt;
Ability: Capable of healing throat illnesses&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

The guard of the checkpoint leading to various Otherworlds, such as [[Hell]] and the land of [[oni]].&lt;br /&gt;
Her job is to distinguish betwen humans and oni, and sort them into their respective locations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

In her appearance here, the [[yama]] have informed her of a human who wanted to enter Hell, but she was worried about how the human would fare in Hell, so she decided to test their strength.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Her place of work is at [[Higan]], but she doesn't spend most of her time there. She seems to typically reside at the top of a waterfall on the [[Youkai Mountain]], in a spot with a beautiful view.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Her true identity is that of Niwatarijin, the god of wild chickens from before they were domesticated. People tend to think of chickens as being sort of weak and cowardly, but she's a polite and just god who values equality and altruism above all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

She's quietly considering what she can do to help raise the status of chickens, who've been reduced to a food source for humans.

{{nihongo|'''Kyouko Kasodani'''|幽谷　響子|Kasodani Kyouko}} is [[yamabiko]] [[youkai]] that embodies mountain echoes and is able to reflect sound waves. She is a recent arrival to [[Myouren Temple]]; with mountain echoes no longer seen as a strange, inexplicable phenomenon, she decided to enter the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] discipline. She now serves the Temple as a priest in-training, and is also responsible for cleaning duties and confronting trespassers.

==General Information==
Kyouko first appeared as the second [[stage]] midboss and [[boss]] in ''[[Ten Desires]]''.

===Personality===
Kyouko is a cheerful, dutiful, and energetic girl who reminds the heroines of the rules before attacking them. Her ability to scream out her remarks cheerfully is perceived as either unnerving or unsurprising in [[Gensokyo]]. However, she is somewhat timid, and when she runs into a mountain climber she'll flee before shouting anything out. Sometimes she can be spotted mumbling sutras to herself, so despite her well-behaved appearance, she may be under some stress.

===Abilities===
;Reflection of sound
This ability comes from her species as a [[Yamabiko]] and is very compatible with reciting Buddhist sutras, but it can also be used offensively: by reflecting sound several times, Kyouko can completely save it up and is able to create danmaku made of compressed air, which can then be loudly scattered around with lethal force.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Grimoire of Usami]]&lt;/ref&gt; In-game, this ability is represented by visible barriers that reflect and then release Kyouko's [[danmaku]]. The barriers themselves are harmless, but she can trap her bullets inside the field and increase the density of the danmaku, where unfortunately for her some bullets are directed away from the player. The reflection itself alters the trajectory of bullets so that they lead to sudden and unexpected attacks. In her sprite's motion when she attacks, she places one hand close to her mouth as if she was about to shout.

===Occupation===
Kyouko is currently a Buddhist priest-in-training at the [[Myouren Temple]]. Her current training is apparently to sweep the main gate every morning. She also recites sutras as the other priests do, but because she's inexperienced, it is loud and difficult to listen to. It may also be because she doesn't actually know what they mean – she's only repeating what she hears other priests say.

Her daily activities at the Myouren Temple, however, leave her quite bored, and as a result of her dissatisfaction with her training, she has formed a punk rock band with [[Mystia Lorelei]] called [[Choujuu Gigaku]]. [[Byakuren Hijiri]] is not pleased with this development, and in ''[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]]'' promises to punish Mystia for being a bad influence.

==Character Design==
[[File:ThGKKyouko.png|thumb|220px|Kyouko in ''[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]]'']]
===Name===
She is known as {{nihongo|''Kyouko Kasodani''|幽谷 響子}}. The characters for {{nihongo|''Kasodani''|幽谷}} literally mean "Ghost Valley", and {{nihongo|''Kyouko''|響子}} means "resonance/echo child". Her name would appear to be a reference to her abilities as a [[yamabiko]], since all of her attacks are based on reflective boundaries. The two kanji characters for her surname are separated from the two characters for her name, but if you put them all together minus the last kanji, you will get an alternative wording for {{nihongo|"[[yamabiko]]"|幽谷響}} - the name of her species, which is also written as {{lang|ja|やまびこ}} or {{lang|ja|山彦}}.&lt;ref&gt;[[wikipedia:Gazu Hyakki Yakō#First Volume - 陰]]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[[wikipedia:ja:山彦|Japanese Wikipedia on {{lang|ja|山彦}}]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Her surname was incorrectly written as "Kasoya" (another possible reading of {{lang|ja|幽谷}}) in both the demo and the first release of ''[[Ten Desires]]'', but this was later fixed in version 1.00b.

===Design===
In ''[[Ten Desires]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; official art, Kyouko has teal colored hair and eyes along with [[yamabiko]] ears. She wears a long pale pink shirt with teal flower-shaped buttons and a white dress below it with black trim. It is stated in [[Symposium of Post-mysticism/Kyouko Kasodani|Symposium of Post-mysticism]] that she has a short tail. She also carries a bamboo broom.

==Appearances==
===Games===
;''Ten Desires''
[[File:Th13KyoukoSprite.png|frame|Kyouko's sprite in ''TD'']]
During the events of ''[[Ten Desires]]'', Kyouko welcomes every heroine that comes to the [[Myouren Temple]] with [[Danmaku]] in attempt to drive off the intruders. However, she is unsuccessful and allows them to investigate the graveyard behind the temple.

===Spin-offs===
;''Hopeless Masquerade''
[[File:Th135Kyouko.png|frame|Kyouko in ''HM'']]
Kyouko made a background cameo appearance in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'' on the [[Myouren Temple]] stage. She is seen sweeping on the stairs.

;''Impossible Spell Card''
Presumably from hearing or seeing a wanted sign about the mischief-making [[amanojaku]] [[Seija Kijin]], Kyouko appears to be one of the many [[youkai]] that tries to capture her on day 2. She uses [[spell card]]s that are considered impossible to dodge.

===Literature===
;''Wild and Horned Hermit, Chapter 9''
Kyouko was depicted as one of the [[youkai]] at the [[Myouren Temple]] that was attacked by a strange "black mist", later revealed to be [[Suika Ibuki]].

;''[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]]''
{{Main|Symposium of Post-mysticism/Bunbunmaru Newspaper 1|l1=Mystia and Kyouko Article}}
[[Aya Shameimaru]] covers the concerts at the middle of the night of a group called "Choujuu Gigaku", formed by Kyouko and [[Mystia Lorelei]]. From her point of view, they are concerts where they "perform off-key music while shouting rebellious lyrics" known as new genre called "punk". When she asked Kyouko about what she thought about the people who complains about their music and the volume, she only responded asking why people can shout "Hello" at the top of the mountain but she can't do it in a concert. Aya, after investing the lyrics of the songs, says that maybe they are just venting about what annoys them, but she hopes there are no real incidents.
==Relationships==
Among the others at the [[Myouren Temple]], she is fond of [[Mamizou Futatsuiwa]], whom she says will listen to any of her concerns. Other information is quite sparse, but it is assumed that she knows the others living at the temple.

;Mystia Lorelei
Together with Mystia they have a band called "[[Choujuu Gigaku]]".

==Additional Information==
*When Kyouko is ready to launch her next wave of attacks, her sprite is animated to make a shouting motion. Her ears vibrate extremely fast, almost like a blur. 
*Kyouko was featured on the official demo CD of ''[[Ten Desires]]''.
*Both of the sayings on her sprites, "gya-te-gya-te-" and "ze-mu-to-do-shu-" are from the latter part of the Japanese version of the [[wikipedia:Heart Sutra|Heart Sutra]], a very common sutra in [[wikipedia:Mahayana|Mahāyāna]] Buddhism.

| translation =　'''○2nd stage boss  Sutra Chanting Yamabiko'''

&lt;br /&gt;
'''Kyouko Kasodani'''

Species: Yamabiko&lt;br /&gt;
Ability: Reflecting sound

You may have loudly shouted "Yahoo-!" when climbing a mountain. If you hear a "Yahoo-!" in response, then it's a yamabiko at work.

She lives in the mountains, and when she hears a joyous voice, she replies back with a loud yell. A youkai that loves to join in on the fun.

But these days, superstitions like "Yamabiko (mountain echoes) are just sound waves being reflected back to you-" have become commonly held. Realizing the emptiness of secularism, she decided to enter the Buddhist discipline.

Her ability works well with reciting Buddhist sutras. It is her everyday work in the mountains.

And by doing so, she now inspires fear as "a sutra-reciting voice coming from a mountain where no one is present", so she was able to retain her place as a youkai.

{{nihongo|'''Letty Whiterock'''|レティ・ホワイトロック|Reti Howaitorokku}} is a seasonal [[youkai]] who's only seen during winter. She seems fittingly cold towards most of the [[human]]s she meets, and is feared by humans as she is known to freeze them.

==General Information==
Letty first appeared as the Stage 1 boss in ''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]'', later she made a brief cameo in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'' as a background character.&lt;br/&gt;
In ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'', it was written that she was a type of [[yuki-onna]]. According to [[ZUN]], if she was to show her full power compared to her strength shown in ''Perfect Cherry Blossom'', it would cause an incident.&lt;ref name="ZUN's AWA"&gt;[[ZUN's AWA Q&amp;A Panel]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abilities===
;Manipulation of chill
She possesses an ability to manipulate chill. It's not an ability to create blizzards or make snow fall, but rather an ability to strengthen the "winter" that exists in the natural world. According to ''Perfect Memento in Strict Sense'', since this is equivalent to an ability that manipulates the winter within nature, she possesses tremendous power according to the environment, but she is pretty much powerless outside of winter. In ''[[Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red]]'', Letty herself said that outside of winter, she hides away in a place where not a ray of sunlight can reach. In ''[[Forbidden Scrollery]]'', she is shown spreading snow over [[Gensokyo]].

By lowering the temperature, [[human]]s become less capable of activity, and lose their fighting spirit. Furthermore, since it's not a physical attack, it's impossible to completely avoid it, and it's not possible to take up any countermeasure except doing something to the extent of wearing thick clothing.

==Character Design==
[[File:PMiSS_letty.jpg|thumb|125px|Illustration of Letty in [[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]].]]
===Name===
Her full name is {{nihongo|'''Letty Whiterock'''|レティ・ホワイトロック}}. Letty's name and personality are based on the character Letitia "Letty" Blacklock from [[Wikipedia:Agatha Christie|Agatha Christie]]'s book "[[Wikipedia:A Murder is Announced|A Murder is Announced]]".

===Design===
In ''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]'', Letty has lavender eyes and curly lavender hair. She wears a blue and white dress with a white apron in front of it. At the top of her skirt that is a golden lapel resembling the alchemical symbol for silver. Also wears a white cap and a nearly transparent cape. She was described by ZUN as being "fairly tall."&lt;ref name="mail"&gt;[[ZUN's E-mails]]&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'', she is seen with white trousers.

*The brooch on her dress resembles the alchemical symbol for silver, coinciding with her theme, "Crystallized Silver".
*In her interview with Aya, Letty states that she hibernates in summer. However, she was seen with other youkai during the events of ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'', that took place in summer.
*Dying while trapped or buried in snow, usually on a mountain, is a common death for humans who become yuki-onna. Letty's information in Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red may be a reference to this.

{{nihongo|'''Lily White'''|リリーホワイト|Rirī Howaito}} is a [[fairy]] who heralds the coming of spring. She first appeared as the 4th stage midboss of ''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]'', then as a special generic enemy in ''[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]'' and a common midboss in ''[[Fairy Wars]]'', each time announcing spring has arrived. She returned as the stage 3 midboss of [[Hidden Star in Four Seasons]].

==General Information==
===Ability===
;Announcing that spring has come 
Lily is able to announce that spring has come. Although it's unclear what this ability entails concretely, [[Gensokyo]]'s residents are made to feel the actual feeling of spring's arrival which makes her very popular with florists. It seems like she is able to provide impetus for flowers and other plants to bloom. In chapter 8 of ''[[Strange and Bright Nature Deity]]'', there was a depiction of the place she passed by instantly becoming spring.

She can still attack with said ability, but it's mostly due to excitement about the spring as she's not very aggressive. While it's advised not to stay around when she attacks, she has a good relation with [[human]]s. She doesn't seem willing to attack even if they catch her. Likewise, humans don't see her as a threat, but rather as a symbol of good luck.

==Background Information==
[[File:PMiSS lily.jpg|thumb|200px|Lily White depicted in [[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]]]
===Design===
In ''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]'', ''[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]'' and ''[[Fairy Wars]]'', Lily has green eyes, long blonde hair and a pair of white feathered wings. In most stages, her hat and dress are white, with a red wave pattern outlining the edges.

A full portrait of Lily can be seen in ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]''. There, it's shown that she wears a caplet.

In the stage of [[Eiki Shiki, Yamaxanadu]] of ''Phantasmagoria of Flower View'', her hat and dress are black, with a red wave pattern outlining the edges. The wave pattern is yellow in ''Fairy Wars''.

In ''[[Hidden Star in Four Seasons]]'', Lily's hat, capelet and sleeves are now plain white, lacking the red wave pattern seen before. The wave pattern on her skirt has been replaced by a pink cherry blossom design, and her skirt now has a pink trim on the bottom. Her wings are bright purple in color.

==Lily's Appearances==
===Games===
;''Perfect Cherry Blossom''
:{{Main|Perfect Cherry Blossom/Story|l1=Perfect Cherry Blossom Story}}
In the middle of stage 4 in ''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]'', Lily only wanted to announce spring with [[danmaku]].

;''Phantasmagoria of Flower View''
[[File:Th09LilyWhite.png|frame|Lily in ''PoFV'']]
:{{Main|Phantasmagoria of Flower View/Story|l1=Phantasmagoria of Flower View Story}}
During ''[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]'', Lily reappears many times to announce spring, being a special type of general enemy. She'll randomly appear on the screen if a fight has gone on for a long time, appearing on both players' fields simultaneously. It seems her idea of announcing spring is via a dense cloud of [[danmaku]] thrown at the player at exactly the worst moment before she leaves, but at least she's trying to do her job the best she can think of. An EX Attacks appears if she's defeated and she will re-appear. Even [[ZUN]] says this is "annoying".

;''Hidden Star in Four Seasons''
[[File:Th16Lily.png|frame|Lily in ''HSiFS'']]
:{{Main|Hidden Star in Four Seasons|l1=Hidden Star in Four Seasons}}
Lily appears as a Stage 3 midboss in ''[[Hidden Star in Four Seasons]]''.

;''Unconnected Marketeers''
[[File:LILY_max.png|75px|]]
:{{Main|Unconnected Marketeers|l1=Unconnected Marketeers}}
Lily appears (in black outfit) after the player activates '''Item Season''' ability card. She will drop either a life fragment or a bomb fragment after the player defeats her. However, she will shoot the player and gets stronger each time the player uses the card.

===Spin-offs===
[[File:Th128LilyWhite.png|frame|Lily in ''FW'']][[File:Th135Lily.png|frame|Lily in ''HM'']]
;''Fairy Wars''
:{{Main|Fairy Wars|l1=Fairy Wars/Story}}
Other than announcing spring as a common midboss shooting [[danmaku]] at [[Cirno]], Lily White doesn't have much to tell or do. She will also dress in black.

;''Hopeless Masquerade''
Lily made a background cameo appearance in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'' on the [[Hall of Dreams' Great Mausoleum]] and [[Youkai Tanuki Forest]] stage. On all [[stage]]s, she is seen floating and cheering.

===Literature===
;''Strange and Bright Nature Deity''
:{{Main|Strange and Bright Nature Deity|l1=Strange and Bright Nature Deity/Lily White}}
In ''[[Strange and Bright Nature Deity]]'', she's credited with the power to bring spring to an area the instant she passes by.

;''Visionary Fairies in Shrine''
In ''[[Visionary Fairies in Shrine]]'', she was among the fairies that were turned into Stone Cherries.

In ''[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]'', Lily White appeared in the stage of [[Eiki Shiki, Yamaxanadu]] wearing a black costume instead of her usual white. Fans thought of this as a potentially different character and named her "Lily Black". Later on however, [[ZUN]] stated in a Kare Radio livestream (August 21, 2010) that the [[Fairy|fairies]] and Lily White in Eiki's stage in ''Phantasmagoria of Flower View'' are all simply cosplaying as the [[yama]], and specifically states that there was never an individual "Lily Black" to start with. This falls in line with other cosplaying fairies throughout the series, such as rabbit fairies in ''[[Imperishable Night]]'' and frog hat fairies in ''[[Mountain of Faith]]''. This black costume also reappeared in ''[[Fairy Wars]]''.

In Chapter 9 of ''[[Silent Sinner in Blue]]'', both Lily White and "Lily Black" appeared in the same image. As the chapter was released before the above livestream (February 9, 2008), it's likely that [[Aki★Eda]] didn't know that those two were meant to be the same characters, and ZUN perhaps didn't notice that particular appearance, or let it pass because it was too late to make changes.

Stage 4 midboss. She's a [[fairy]] who appears when the spring is approaching.

Mainly, she possesses the ability of announcing that spring has come.

Within the game, she uses neither words nor [[Spell Card]]s.&lt;br /&gt;
Her ability is only a little stronger than minor enemies'.

She checked above the clouds since spring did not come no matter how much she waited. When she did so, spring had already arrived there. She only wanted to announce that spring had finally arrived above the clouds to humans in front of her, but to [[Reimu Hakurei|Reimu]] and her companions, it unfortunately appeared as a hostile attack to them.

When a fight has gone on for a long time, or has been stalemated, "Lily White" the fairy herald of spring appears on both players' fields at the same time.

She will release a large number of large bullets and white bullets before she leaves. Annoying.

She can be shot down, and if you do, a large number of EX Attacks will be sent to your opponent.

Even after leaving or being shot down many times, that annoying special fairy continues to re-appear.

{{nihongo|'''Lord Tsukuyomi'''|月夜見}} is mentioned in Chapter 3 of ''[[Cage in Lunatic Runagate]]'' by [[Watatsuki no Toyohime]] and [[Watatsuki no Yorihime]], and is the founder and lord of the [[Lunar Capital]] and the night.

==Character Basis==
===Origin===
Also known as Tsukuyomi-no-kami or Tsukuyomi-no-Mikoto, [[Wikipedia:Tsukuyomi|Tsukuyomi]] is the moon god in [[Wikipedia:Shinto|Shinto]]. Tsukuyomi is the second of "three noble children" born when Izanagi-no-Mikoto, the god who created the first land, [[Wikipedia:Onogoro-shima|Onogoro-shima]], was cleansing himself of his sins escaping the underworld and the clutches of his enraged dead wife, [[Wikipedia:Izanami-no-Mikoto|Izanami-no-Mikoto]]. Tsukuyomi-no-Mikoto was then born when he washed out of Izanagi-no-Mikoto's right eye, [[Wikipedia:Amaterasu Omikami|Amaterasu]], the sun goddess, out of his left, and [[Wikipedia:Susanoo|Susanoo]], god of the sea and storms, out of his nose. In another story, Tsukuyomi-no-Mikoto was instead born from a mirror made of white copper in Izanagi-no-Mikoto's right hand.

===Name===
The name Tsukuyomi-no-Mikoto is a combination of the Japanese words for "moon; month" (tsuki) and "to read; to count" (yomu). Another interpretation is that his name is a combination of "moonlit night" (Tsukiyo) and a verb meaning "to look at" (miru). Yet another interpretation is that the kanji for {{nihongo|bow|弓|yumi}} was corrupted with the kanji for "yomi". "[[Wikipedia:Yomi|Yomi]]" may also refer to the Japanese underworld, though this interpretation is unlikely.

==Story==
;''Cage in Lunatic Runagate''
:{{Main|Cage in Lunatic Runagate/Third Chapter|l1=Cage in Lunatic Runagate Chapter 3}}

Thousands of years ago, Tsukuyomi realized that Earth was an impure, blood-stained world, which was stealing life from all living beings. So, this sage left Earth and took with him his most trusted relatives, including [[Eirin Yagokoro]], his elder who he relied on the most, and founded the Lunar Capital. The Moon lacked the impurities of Earth and those who took up residence there forsook any lifespan, meaning they were neither alive or dead, but because they are not truly immortal, still stand a faint chance of death of injury.

A few decades ago (presumably around the time of the Apollo project), Lord Tsukuyomi was shocked that the scientific community on Earth has realized the world is built on probabilities. The threat that the beings of Earth and their impurities may reach the Lunar Capital now exists, and the denizens of the Moon have been on alert since then.

==Relationships==
;Amaterasu (Sister. The name is implied, but unconfirmed)
;[[Eirin Yagokoro]] ([[Lunar Capital]] Co-Founder)

Not much was known how close they are, however they both founded the lunar capital together, so they could have been in good terms. It's unknown if their relationship remains the same after Eirin's desertion.

;[[Watatsuki no Toyohime]] (Subordinate)
;[[Watatsuki no Yorihime]] (Subordinate)

==Additional Information==
*Tsukuyomi is only referred to as a sage, not a god in Silent Sinner in Blue. Assuming Amaterasu Oomikami (who clearly is a god in the [[Touhou Project]]) is Tsukuyomi's sister, this could imply Tsukuyomi is a god as well if they are related. Additionally, in Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom Kanako states the Lunarians are the same as the amatsukami, which indicates Tsukuyomi is also a god, even if it was unclear back when Silent Sinner in Blue was published.
*Amaterasu, who is Tsukuyomi's sister in Shinto mythology, isn't mentioned by name, but as "Lord Tsukuyomi's sister". She is implied to have sun related abilities in [[Cage in Lunatic Runagate/Third Chapter|Cage in Lunatic Runagate Chapter 3]], like Amaterasu does in mythology, as well as some relation with crows, who are the mythical Amaterasu's messengers. It is unconfirmed if she is the same being as the sun goddess Amaterasu. The sun goddess Amaterasu actually is mentioned several times in various official works, and is even summoned in chapter 16 of Silent Sinner in Blue by [[Watatsuki no Yorihime]], a [[Lunarian]], as a god with sun based abilities, easily defeating [[Remilia Scarlet]]. Despite this, no reference to her being the same person as Tsukuyomi's sister mentioned in Cage in Lunatic Runagate was ever made in the manga itself.
**For an example of Amaterasu's other mentions as a god, it is shown in [[Strange and Bright Nature Deity]] chapters 15 and 16 that Reimu performs an ritual on New Year's Eve every two years to suppress Lucifer (Amano-Kagaseo no Mikoto) (the Day Star, also known as the planet Venus) and welcome Amaterasu Ookami (the sun) into the new year. This ritual weakens the youkais' power for the next two years. She is also mentioned in [[Curiosities of Lotus Asia]].
**In chapter 19 of Silent Sinner in Blue, the well-known myth about Amaterasu shutting herself away in a cave is revealed to be the incident where Lunarians first started using shimenawa ropes to influence Earth's history. Despite Amaterasu specifically being named, there was still no reference of an actual connection of her to the Lunar Capital. In that same conversation, it is also implied that the "heavenly gods" who took away Lord Daikoku's lands (the Kuni Yuzuri myth, explaining the origin of the imperial house of Japan) were the Lunarians. In the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki, Amaterasu was one of the grand architects of this scheme, but in Silent Sinner in Blue, her name is not mentioned in that part of the conversation. Thus, although Amaterasu and Lord Tsukuyomi's sister are both sun-based, and the Lunarians apparently were responsible for several things that Amaterasu was responsible for in Shinto myth, there is no direct confirmation that they are one and the same in Silent Sinner in Blue. As stated above, Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom arguably changed this.
**According to the Nihon Shoki, Amaterasu and Tsukuyomi originally "shared the sky", but had a falling out of sorts when Tsukuyomi killed the goddess of food, due to her offering him food that she had spit out (however, in the Kojiki version, it's instead Susano-o who kills an analogous goddess, and no such myth about Tsukuyomi is present - in fact, no mention of Tsukuyomi is made after he's born). Given that Yorihime initially mistakes a crow from the outside as one of Lord Tsukuyomi's sister's familiars, it's possible that Lord Tsukuyomi's sister also has her current residence outside of the moon.
*In theory, if [[Keiki Haniyasushin]] is meant to be the same as the mythical Haniyasu and Haniyamahime, and [[Eika Ebisu]] is the same as the mythical Hiruko, they both have the same father as Tsukuyomi.

However, she had the bad luck of running into the heroine inside the border space between Gensokyo and Makai before making it out into the human world and was defeated. She was actually rather polite too.

{{nihongo|'''Luna Child'''|ルナチャイルド|Runa Chairudo}} is a [[fairy]] and one of the members of the '''[[Three Fairies of Light]]''', composed of her, [[Sunny Milk]], and [[Star Sapphire]]. She currently lives in a tree close to the [[Hakurei Shrine]] with her two partners. She often pranks [[human]]s along with her two partners, using her ability to mute sound around her to her advantage.

==General Information==
Luna first appeared in the manga ''[[Touhou Sangetsusei]]'''s first work ''[[Eastern and Little Nature Deity]]'' as one of the three protagonists, and had the same role throughout the sub-series. [[ZUN]] stated that the reason why he chose Luna, Sunny, and Star as main characters is because the three of them have little fighting ability, yet are much more outgoing than [[Rinnosuke Morichika]], making them ideal characters for introducing various aspects of Gensokyo's daily life that Rinnosuke doesn't participate in.{{reference needed|ZUN's statement}} She later made an appearance in a game as a [[boss]] in ''[[Fairy Wars]]'' and a background appearance in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]''.

Luna, much like her partners, is not very powerful. Her power allows her to mute sound around her, although, when used in tandem with Sunny's power to refract light, they can be a powerful stealthy pair. Luna, much like Sunny Milk, gets weaker when her natural element, the moon, isn't present in the sky. During ''Strange and Bright Nature Deity'', Luna moves from her residence in the [[Forest of Magic]] to a new home near to the [[Hakurei Shrine]].

===Personality===
Luna is often described as clumsy and maybe even stupid at times, and is as curious as other [[Fairy|fairies]]. She has a rare characteristic for a fairy: she loves coffee beans and is sometimes seen stealing some from [[human]]s, and she is also fond of alcohol. In the mangas, she's always tripping over something – even over nothing. Fairies are generally considered to have a quite different mindset compared to [[human]]s due to their unique nature. However, Luna's apparently depicted a bit different to the usual fairies: She tends to read books and newspaper, and has a habit of a sceptical and rather logical thinking. Her common sense is more closer to humans in this regard. As result, the "stupid" she's commonly associated with is a lack of practical smarts, not book knowledge.

===Abilities===
;Muting (the surrounding) sound
[[File:ELNDCH1LunaMuting.jpg|thumb|200px|Luna, muting rain in ''[[Eastern and Little Nature Deity]]'']]
[[File:SBND16LunaMuting.jpg|thumb|200px|Luna, muting an area in ''[[Strange and Bright Nature Deity]]'']]
Luna is able to mute all the sounds around her. It is self-styled as "the ultimate fairy weapon in hide-and-seek". In hide-and-seek, it might seem that her ability is weaker than [[Sunny Milk]] or [[Star Sapphire]] – but, just like Sunny who manipulates vision, it is an ability suited for mischief, and it is not simply a specified range, and as she is able to consciously mute only a specified sound, it has high usefulness. However, since she also uses this ability even when it isn't necessary to mute sound, there are also instances of appealing for existence.

In chapter 1 of ''[[Strange and Bright Nature Deity]]'', it was said "she is not able to erase anything other than sound, so it is the most disadvantageous," but however it is conceived, Star Sapphire who can't grasp anything other than position is more disadvantageous. Also in the manga, the ability was changed to "ability to manipulate moonlight", but the substance of the ability has not changed. Different from Sunny, there has not been a depiction where she manipulated moonlight.

Also, by bathing in moonlight, she is able to quickly recover her wounds. Since she receives the influence of moonlight, the condition of the moon gives forth the quality of her ability.

Furthermore, in ''[[Touhou Sangetsusei]]'', any ability has no effect under [[Reisen Udongein Inaba]]'s ability to manipulate wavelengths. As opposed to Sunny and Luna who manipulate wavelengths in a very limited manner, it can be said that Reisen manipulates wavelengths in a more comprehensive manner.

Previously upon meeting [[Yukari Yakumo]], she received advice regarding the true nature of the power of the "light of the moon", but due to tension, she did not hear anything but half of the talk, and for some reason she forgot (or was made to forget) the contents of the talk.&lt;ref name="Eastern and Little Nature Deity"&gt; [[Eastern and Little Nature Deity/Fairy of the Moon]]&lt;/ref&gt; Because of that, she probably wants to meet again the [[youkai]] she met at that time – Yukari; in actuality, she met her several times afterwards. Yukari said "the power of the light of the moon is even superior to the light of the sun. A peaceful power, the colour of the heart, sorrows, the light of the moon is a light that does not bewilder anything. Come now, wake up. Why do you think you are treated well by the other light of the sun and the light of the stars?"

==Character Design==
[[File:PMiSS_luna.jpg|thumb|200px|Luna, as illustrated in ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'']]
===Name===
Her full name is {{nihongo|''Luna Child''|ルナチャイルド|Runa Chairudo}}. Luna's name is based on the element which she draws power from: the [[moon]]. Her name also has a few official English translations, such as "Luna Child" itself&lt;ref name="SAC" /&gt;, "Luna''r'' Child"&lt;ref name="CompAce" /&gt; and "Lunarchild" &lt;ref name="PMiSSLuna" /&gt;. The data files in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'' furthers the use of "Luna", although this is likely the use of romanising.

===Design===
Luna Child's depiction remains the same throughout her presence in the series, although she receives a few minor clothing alterations. In ''[[Eastern and Little Nature Deity]]'', Luna has red eyes and yellow hair, arranged into six princess curls on both sides of her head, as well as a pair of wings. She wears a white and black dress having long sleeves and a few black ribbons at the front of her dress, along with a big one below her neck and an even bigger one in her back. She also has a white shoulder cloth having black outlines, and a white beret with black ribbons attached on its sides. She wears a pair of slippers as well. When reading books, she's sometimes depicted with reading glasses.

In ''[[Strange and Bright Nature Deity]]'', Luna's long sleeves are now short and puffy. In ''[[Fairy Wars]]'', the lunar cycle is represented at the bottom of Luna's dress, although in her later appearances in ''Strange and Bright Nature Deity'' and ''[[Oriental Sacred Place]]'', it isn't present.

In ''Strange and Bright Nature Deity'', during New Year's eve, Sunny Milk decides that she wants to bond all the fairies together to cause an incident. Sunny then crushes Cirno's home, along with her partners including Luna who follows Sunny's plan and leaving a flag showcasing images of their faces to show their superiority. Afterwards, Cirno sets on sending them a declaration of war, but the fairy trio believes that it's from the [[human]]s and train for the months to come everyday, believing they would soon fight [[Reimu Hakurei]].

The next spring, they are confronted by [[Cirno]], who was reminded by the fairies flag that they had destroyed her house months prior, resulting in the [[Fairy Wars|Fairy War]].

Luna made a background cameo appearance in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'' on the [[Hakurei Shrine]], [[Hall of Dreams' Great Mausoleum]] and [[Youkai Tanuki Forest]] stage. On each stage, she is seen with [[Star Sapphire]] and [[Sunny Milk]] floating and cheering.

{{nihongo|'''Lunasa Prismriver'''|ルナサ・プリズムリバー|Runasa Purizumuribaa}} is a member of the [[Prismriver Sisters]] who performs magnificent music as part of the "Prismriver Ensemble" along with [[Merlin Prismriver]] and [[Lyrica Prismriver]].

==General Information==
Lunasa first made her début on as the [[stage]] 4 [[boss]] of ''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]'' and appeared as a playable character in ''[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]'', although she didn't have her own scenario. She also made a cameo in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]''.

===Personality===
Lunasa is said to be more mature and calm, although she is a little more pessimistic. It is said that is due to the fact that she is really honest and she was tricked in the past. She is a really reserved person, so she is quiet and melancholic &lt;ref&gt; Lunasa's article in ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Lunasa Prismriver|Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'' &lt;/ref&gt;

===Abilities===
;Performing on musical instruments without hands or feet
In ''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]'', this is the ability that all three sisters have been specified to have. This probably derives from the ability [[poltergeist]]s have, put to specific use in performing with musical instruments. By manipulating the spirits of instruments, they're able to manipulate the spirits of notes to create sounds. Since they needn't have direct contact with the instruments, they're able to play music impossible to play by hand.

Since the three sisters' musical performance is something that they have learned themselves after Layla's death, their previous ability was probably along the lines of "moving things without hands or feet" or "performing notes without hands or feet". The former is because poltergeists in general can move things and made them float. The latter is because in the general phenomena of poltergeists, they can be heard from anywhere, like a rapping noise for example.

;Performing melancholic notes
Melancholic notes are notes that calm people's feelings. Upon hearing her performance too much, the listener falls into such depression, where they don't to want to do anything. Like Merlin's notes, it affects the mind and [[spirit]], so it's somewhat dangerous. However, since her little sister Lyrica's performance has a negating effect, it's safe enough outside of solos.

Perhaps due to this ability, in ''[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]'''s match mode, whenever Lunasa or Merlin win against each other, although the opponent's image would normally always become sad-faced, they always forcibly produce the opponent's face to become tedious or happy. To add all characters beside the Prismriver Sisters, regardless of whether they are human-like [[youkai]] or the powerful youkai of flowers, it's got an effect. Perhaps surprisingly, even the [[yama]] [[Eiki Shiki, Yamaxanadu]] had her face forcibly turned tedious or smiling.

Incidentally, since youkai, unlike [[human]]s, have more to worry about their mind and spirit than their body, it can be said that an ability like theirs that has an influence on the mind and spirit is, in a sense, their natural enemy.

===Species===
Although strictly speaking, [[poltergeist]]s and phantoms seem different, upon some principle in ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'', they have been categorised as phantoms. They're not what has become of living people and animals after death, but rather have an existence created by [[Layla Prismriver]]. Generally, it may be more proper to call them magic beings or spirits. It is known based on their official profiles and from comments by [[Eiki Shiki, Yamaxanadu|Eiki]] that none of the original four sisters are still alive today, though it is unknown how long ago the events were that spawned these three poltergeists occurred.

==Character Design==
[[File:PMiSS lunasa.jpg|thumb|150px|Lunasa's depiction in ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]''.]]
===Name===
Her full name is {{nihongo|''Lunasa Prismriver''|ルナサ・プリズムリバー}}. {{nihongo|Lunasa|ルナサ}} is likely to have been derived from {{nihongo|"Luna"|ルナ}}, meaning the {{nihongo|[[Moon]]|月|tsuki}}, hence the crescent moon icon on top of her hat. Probably a coincidence, "Lunasa" may also refer to the traditional Irish band [[Wikipedia:Lúnasa (band)|Lúnasa]], in which the band was named after [[Wikipedia:Lughnasadh|Lughnasadh]] (pronounced 'LOO-na-sa'), a [[Wikipedia:Gaels|Gaelic]] festival marking the beginning of the harvest season. In the data files for ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'', her name was romanised as "runasa", rather than an actual translation.

Sometimes "Prismriver" is translated as {{nihongo||虹川|niji-kawa}}, which means "rainbow river", even though "rainbow" does not mean "prism". Thus, she and her sisters are sometimes referred to as the {{nihongo|"niji-kawa sisters"|虹川三姉妹}}. The middle dot ({{lang|ja|・}}) in the middle of her name is used in foreign names to show where the next word begins.

===Design===
Lunasa wears black clothing, is a violinist, and is the first sister. She has gold eyes, short blond hair, and is always seen with her violin floating nearby. Her band uniform is black, with white and red trim. Her hat has a red crescent moon decoration at the peak. Her alternative outfit in ''Phantasmagoria of Flower View'' is same as her normal outfit, except her dress is black. She is a similar height to Merlin and is taller than Lyrica.

==Appearances==
===Games===
;''Perfect Cherry Blossom''
[[File:Th07LunasaSprite.png|frame|Lunasa's sprite in ''PCB'']]
During the events of ''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]'', the three Prismriver sisters are preparing to play a concert for the flower viewing at [[Hakugyokurou]]. They attempt to stop the player from entering the [[Netherworld]] together, and the progression of the battle is affected by which sister the player decides to focus on attacking during their first [[spell card]]. The dialogue they bounce back and forth between each other and the player is actually quite comical, and shows their very individual personalities. Lunasa is mature and mellow, Merlin is happy-go-lucky and clueless, and Lyrica is a sly smart-alack.

;''Phantasmagoria of Flower View''
[[File:Th09LunasaBackSprite.png|frame|left|Lunasa's back sprite in ''PoFV'']]
In ''[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]'', Lunasa, with Merlin, follows Lyrica as she battle various [[characters]]. The two reveal themselves to her as she encounters [[Eiki Shiki, Yamaxanadu]] and Eiki indication that she's not alone. They were following her throughout her scenario because they were interested on what she was doing and to come out when things got dangerous. If [[Eiki Shiki, Yamaxanadu]]'s Extra scenario is completed, then Lunasa becomes a selectable character, although she can only appear in Match Mode and has no scenario.

===Spin-offs===
[[File:Th135Lunasa.png|frame|Lunasa in ''HM'']]
;''Hopeless Masquerade''
Lunasa made a background cameo appearance in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'' on the [[Palanquin Ship]] and [[Divine Spirit Mausoleum]] stage. She is seen floating with her sisters.

;''Antinomy of Common Flowers''
Lunasa made a cameo in ''[[Antinomy of Common Flowers]]'' in the Concert Stage of the Sun. She is seen playing her violin with [[Prismriver Sisters|her sisters]] and [[Raiko Horikawa]].

==Relationships==
;[[Prismriver Sisters|Sisters]]
Lunasa has two other sisters, [[Merlin Prismriver]] and [[Lyrica Prismriver]], who all three were created by their fourth sister [[Layla Prismriver]], who is now deceased. They perform music and festivals as a trio. Because these three sisters are created [[Poltergeist]]s who were made by Layla to have the appearance and personalities of her three older sisters from whom she had been separated, they're technically all the same age since they were presumably created at the same time. They only act out the roles of oldest, middle, and youngest sister based on whichever one they were made to resemble.

;[[Raiko Horikawa]]
Raiko is now a member of the Prismriver band, and she performs with the Prismriver sisters at festivals. It's unknown what exact relationship Raiko has with the sisters.

;[[Yuyuko Saigyouji]]
[[Yuyuko Saigyouji]] was their employer during the events of [[Perfect Cherry Blossom]].

==Additional Information==
*Lunasa's [[spell card]]s, "Guarneri del Gesù", "Stradivarius" and "Pseudo Stradivarius" make references to some of the most famous violin makers of all time, [[Wikipedia:Giuseppe Guarneri|Giuseppe Guarneri]] and [[Wikipedia:Antonio Stradivari|Antonio Stradivari]]. Oddly enough, the [[Wikipedia:Amati|Amati]] family of luthiers are left out, despite making a fair share of equally good instruments.
*Her spell card background has an image of a score for ''Last Spring'', from ''Two Elegiac Melodies'' by [[Wikipedia:Edvard Grieg|Edvard Grieg]].
*Lunasa, along with the other [[Prismriver Sisters]], [[Mystia Lorelei]] and [[Yuuka Kazami]], are the only first-[[Windows]]-era-[[spell-card]]-capable characters not to appear in ''[[Shoot the Bullet]]''.

{{nihongo|'''Lyrica Prismriver'''|リリカ・プリズムリバー|Ririka Purizumuribaa}} is a member of the [[Prismriver Sisters]] who performs magnificent music as part of the "Prismriver Ensemble" along with [[Lunasa Prismriver]] and [[Merlin Prismriver]].

==General Information==
Lyrica first made her debut on as the [[stage]] 4 [[boss]] of ''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]'' and appeared as a playable character in ''[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]''. She also made a cameo in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]''.

===Personality===
Lyrica has a very clever attitude. Normally, she is the one convincing her sisters to fight because she doesn't like to battle alone. Making the minimum effort to get the maximum benefit is the only thing she thinks of. She knows herself every well. She doesn't act without being 3 movements ahead &lt;ref&gt; Lyrica's article in ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Lyrica Prismriver|Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'' &lt;/ref&gt; 

===Abilities===
;Performing on musical instruments without hands or feet
In ''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]'', this is the ability that all three sisters have been specified to have. This probably derives from the ability [[poltergeist]]s have, put to specific use in performing with musical instruments. By manipulating the spirits of instruments, they're able to manipulate the spirits of notes to create sounds. Since they needn't have direct contact with the instruments, they're able to play music impossible to play by hand.

Since the three sisters' musical performance is something that they have learned themselves after Layla's death, their previous ability was probably along the lines of "moving things without hands or feet" or "performing notes without hands or feet". The former is because poltergeists in general can move things and made them float. The latter is because in the general phenomena of poltergeists, they can be heard from anywhere, like a rapping noise for example.

;Performing illusionary notes
Illusionary notes are notes that don't exist in the natural world, the "dead" notes of the [[outside world]], so to say. It integrates "melancholic" and "maniac" notes and has an effect of making them easier to hear. The added effect of making the three sisters' performance more tolerable to its listeners is due to her help.

As the keyboard is like an illusion&lt;ref name="BAiJRLyrica"&gt;[[Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red]]: [[Bohemian_Archive_in_Japanese_Red/Lyrica|Lyrica]]&lt;/ref&gt;, it seems like a symbol of an instrument that performs notes that have been lost (become dead) in the outside world. It has no effect on the mind and spirit, but perhaps since it does not directly resound in the mind and spirit, it seems that according to [[Marisa Kirisame]], although her performance has technique, it doesn't resound with the heart, and is therefore dull.&lt;ref name="GoMPrism"&gt;[[The Grimoire of Marisa]] - [[The Grimoire of Marisa/The Prismriver Sisters' Spell Cards|The Prismriver Sisters]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, due to playing notes of this characteristic, even if she wins in ''[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]'', she has, unfortunately, no special production unlike her older sisters.

===Species===
Although strictly speaking, [[poltergeist]]s and phantoms seem different, upon some principle in ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'', they have been categorised as phantoms. They're not what has become of living people and animals after death, but rather have an existence created by [[Layla Prismriver]]. Generally, it may be more proper to call them magic beings or spirits. It is known based on their official profiles and from comments by [[Eiki Shiki, Yamaxanadu|Eiki]] that none of the original four sisters are still alive today, though it is unknown how long ago the events were that spawned these three poltergeists occurred.

==Character Design==
[[File:PMiSS lyrica.jpg|160px|thumb|Lyrica's depiction in ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]''.]]
===Name===
Her full name is {{nihongo|''Lyrica Prismriver''|リリカ・プリズムリバー}}. "Lyrica" is likely to have derived from {{nihongo|"lyric"|リリック}}, relating to musical drama and opera, or {{nihongo|"lyrics"|歌詞|kashi}}, the words to a particular song (or other vocal music). Although, "lyrics" can also be a plural for "lyric", meaning that the non-plural refers to one line within a song. In the data files for ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'', her name was romanised as "ririka", rather than an actual translation.

Sometimes "Prismriver" is translated as {{nihongo||虹川|niji-kawa}}, which means "rainbow river", even though "rainbow" does not mean "prism". Thus, she and her sisters are sometimes referred to as the {{nihongo|"niji-kawa sisters"|虹川三姉妹}}. The middle dot ({{lang|ja|・}}) in the middle of her name is used in foreign names to show where the next word begins.

===Design===
Lyrica wears red clothing, is a keyboardist, and is the third sister. She has brown eyes, short light brown hair, and is always seen with her winged keyboard floating nearby. The keyboard has "L.P." (her initials) written.  Her band uniform is red, with pink and black trim. She is sometimes depicted as wearing shorts due to the way her portraits appear in [[Perfect Cherry Blossom]] and [[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]], but her sprites from PoFV and [[Antimony of Common Flowers]] depict her wearing a skirt. Her hat has a green shooting star decoration at the peak. Her alternative outfit in ''Phantasmagoria of Flower View'' is the same as her normal outfit, except her hair is lighter in colour, her clothes are yellow, and her hat's shooting star is blue. Her keyboard has "Prismriver" written on it. According to [[ZUN's E-mails]], she's also the shortest of the three.

==Appearances==
===Games===
;Perfect Cherry Blossom
[[File:Th07LyricaSprite.png|frame|Lyrica's sprite in ''PCB'']]
During the events of ''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]'', the three Prismriver sisters are preparing to play a concert for the flower viewing at [[Hakugyokurou]]. They attempt to stop the player from entering the [[Netherworld]] together, and the progression of the battle is affected by which sister the player decides to focus on attacking during their first [[spell card]]. The dialogue they bounce back and forth between each other and the player is actually quite comical, and shows their very individual personalities. Lunasa is mature and mellow, Merlin is happy-go-lucky and clueless, and Lyrica is a sly smart-alack.

;''Phantasmagoria of Flower View''
[[File:Th09LyricaBackSprite.png|frame|left|Lyrica's back sprite in ''PoFV'']]
In ''[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]'', Lyrica goes around [[Gensokyo]] because the only thing Lyrica is interested in is finding a good place for a solo performance and to find new sounds to use. However, she just keeps bumping into weird people while looking for a place to play until she gets more and more lost. Finally, she ends in [[Higan]] against [[Eiki Shiki, Yamaxanadu]], who reveals that her sisters, Lunasa and Merlin, were following her her throughout her scenario because they were interested on what she was doing and to come out when things got dangerous.

===Spin-offs===
[[File:Th135Lyrica.png|frame|Lyrica in ''HM'']]
;''Hopeless Masquerade''
Lyrica made a background cameo appearance in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'' on the [[Palanquin Ship]] and [[Divine Spirit Mausoleum]] stage. She is seen floating happily with her sisters playing her floating keyboard.
;''Antinomy of Common Flowers''
Lyrica made a cameo in ''[[Antinomy of Common Flowers]]'' in the Concert Stage of the Sun. She is seen playing her keyboard with [[Prismriver Sisters|her sisters]] and [[Raiko Horikawa]].
==Relationships==
;[[Prismriver Sisters|Sisters]]
Lyrica has two other sisters, [[Lunasa Prismriver]] and [[Merlin Prismriver]], who all three were created by their fourth sister [[Layla Prismriver]], who is now deceased. They perform music and festivals as a trio. Because these three sisters are created [[Poltergeist]]s who were made by Layla to have the appearance and personalities of her three older sisters from whom she had been separated, they're technically all the same age since they were presumably created at the same time. They only act out the roles of oldest, middle, and youngest sister based on whichever one they were made to resemble.

;[[Raiko Horikawa]]
Raiko is now a member of the Prismriver band, and she performs with the Prismriver sisters at festivals. It's unknown what exact relationship Raiko has with the sisters.

;[[Yuyuko Saigyouji]]
[[Yuyuko Saigyouji]] was their employer during the events of [[Perfect Cherry Blossom]].

{{nihongo|'''Mai'''|マイ}} is a [[Magician|Witch]] who resides in [[Makai]]. Together with [[Yuki]] she serves as one of two bosses in the fourth stage of ''[[Mystic Square]]''.

==Character Design==
===Name===
Her name is {{nihongo|''Mai''|マイ}}. There is no official meaning to {{lang|ja|マイ}} exept that it can mean "my" (as in "My name is-"). Also, Mai has exactly the same name as [[Mei and Mai|Mai]] from the ''[[Seihou Project]]'', except Seihou's Mai has [[wikipedia:Hiragana|hiragana]] characters and Mai from the ''[[Touhou Project]]'' has [[wikipedia:Katakana|katakana]].

===Design===
[[File:Th05MaiAlternate.png|80px|thumb|left|Mai's alternate appearance with demon wings.]]
In ''[[Mystic Square]]'''s official art, Mai has light-blue eyes and blue hair, she has a light pink bow in her hair. She also wears a light pink dress and has small light pink wings. She also has another form where she is seen with large white demon wings.

==Appearances==
===PC-98===
;''Mystic Square''
:{{Main|Mystic Square/Story|l1=Mystic Square Story}}
When the heroine traveled into Makai during the events of ''[[Mystic Square]]'' Mai and [[Yuki]] were waiting for her. Together they attempted to prevent the heroine from going any further into Makai, but ultimately failed. Mai is the quieter of the two, but also seems to believe that she is stronger; if Yuki is defeated first, Mai will claim Yuki was just holding her back.

===Project Blank===
{{project blank note|section}}
[[File:SMDMai.png|frame|Mai as she appears in ''[[Samidare]]''.]]
Mai and [[Yuki]] made an appearance as the second midbosses of the Extra Stage in ''[[Samidare]]'', similar to their boss battle in ''[[Mystic Square]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s fourth stage. This appearance is unofficial, as [[ZUN]] had no involvement in the development of the game; Yoko (blankvision), one of the members of "[[Shunsatsu sare do?]]" and [[RebRank]] were responsible for their appearance. Mai's design has not changed from that used in ''[[Mystic Square]]'', save for her being encapsulated in a blue sphere of light. Furthermore, she and her partner's second attack in this appearance looks very similar to [[Alice Margatroid]]'s second attack in ''Mystic Square''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Extra Stage.

==Relationships==
===Yuki===
[[Yuki]] is a Witch like Mai, and it is possible that the two are friends. However, during the fourth stage of ''[[Mystic Square]]'', Mai does not appear to be distressed if [[Yuki]] is defeated first, going so far as to call her deadweight. Mai also claims to be stronger than Yuki.

===Minor Relationships===
;Shinki
[[Shinki]] is the creator of [[Makai]] and everything within it. In light of this, Shinki may also have created Mai.

==Additional Information==
*She bears a resemblance to [[Remilia Scarlet]]. She also bears a resemblance to [[Cirno]], who shares her ice affinity.
*Despite her claim that she is stronger than [[Yuki]], her in-game bullet patterns are less complex and easier to deal with than Yuki's patterns.
*Mai's personality and the title of her theme music may be a reference to the ninth circle of Hell in the [[wikipedia:Divine Comedy|Divine Comedy]], which represents treacherous sin with the frozen river named Cocytus, where the biblical traitor Judas Iscariot is being tortured for all eternity.

{{nihongo|'''Mai Teireida'''|丁礼田 舞|Teireida Mai}} is a servant of [[Okina Matara]], along with her partner [[Satono Nishida]].

==General Information==
Mai appeared as the Stage 4 Midboss, Stage 5 Boss and Extra Stage Midboss in ''[[Hidden Star in Four Seasons]]''.

===Personality===
She has little memory of her time as a human, but has retained her personality. She is a bit of a scatterbrain, but is quick to take action. She also holds the distinction of using ''boku'' to refer to herself. Still, she acts for Okina's sake alone, seemingly not having the free will to question otherwise. &lt;ref name="HSiFSP"&gt; ''[[Hidden Star in Four Seasons]]'' - Satono and Mai's Profile &lt;/ref&gt;

===Abilities===
;Drawing out people's vitality by dancing behind them
Entrusted to Mai, it is not an ability of hers, but of her master, Okina. She draws out the latent ability in all things by dancing behind them, in this case vitality.

===Occupation===
Mai, along with Satono, are douji to Okina Matara. &lt;ref name="HSiFSP"/&gt; Okina describes the job as a fixer, helping Okina maintaining the balance of Gensokyo from behind the scenes. Okina compared the job to being "her precious arms and legs." Okina also mentions that she swaps them out with new humans, periodically, implying that both of them are successors to previous douji Okina has had. &lt;ref&gt; ''[[Hidden Star in Four Seasons/Story/Marisa's Scenario|Hidden Star in Four Seasons]]'' - "Yes. They're my precious arms and legs, which is why I periodically swap them out for new humans." &lt;/ref&gt; According to Okina, a Teireida is in charge of lifeforce&lt;ref&gt;[[Hidden Star in Four Seasons/Story/Marisa's Extra|Hidden Star in Four Seasons Extra Stage]] — "So which one would you prefer to be? '''Teireida in charge of life energy''', or Nishida in charge of mental energy?" - Okina&lt;/ref&gt;, a job Mai currently occupies.
===Species===
She and Satono appear humanoid, but their species and Okina's extra dialogue indicates that the two currently aren't human.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hidden Star in Four Seasons/Story/Marisa's Extra|Hidden Star in Four Seasons Extra Stage]] — "If you take over, I intend to release them and make them human again. Although if you don't take the job, they'll remain as they are forever." - Okina&lt;/ref&gt;
==Background Information==
===Origin===
{{Stub|section}}

===Name===
Her first name {{nihongo|''Mai''|舞}}, unlike the PC-98 character [[Mai]], is written in kanji and translates as "dance". Her surname is {{nihongo|''Teireida''|丁礼田}} and is, in order, written with the kanji for "even number", "town block" or "town ward", "gratitude", "ceremony" or "worship", and "rice field". The character for "rice field" is shared in the surname of her partner, [[Satono Nishida]].

===Design===
Mai has Reseda green hair, cut short with two long side locks, and pea colored eyes. She wears a ''Kazaori-eboshi'', a smaller type of ''eboshi'' that has been folded. She wears a dotted dark green dress with short sleeves. Her sleeves have a black cuff and rose lace. The bottom of the dress is also adorned with the same rose lace. Her dress has a black high neck collar, connected to a white bertha collar tipped with rose lace. She wears a white half apron fastened around her waist with the same rose lace. There's a row of yellow buttons and bows along the front of her dress, starting at the bertha collar, overlapping the apron, down till the edge of the dress. On the bertha collar and apron there's one small yellow bow, and a big one lower on the apron that ends with tassels. She has black kneesocks and green shoes with short heels. She hold a bamboo stalk with her right hand. Mai's as well as Satono's design and pose is presumably based off the clothing and pose of the two servants of ''matarajin'' as seen in [https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DG6teFIXgAAYLW4.jpg:large this woodblock print].

===Games===

[[File:Th16MaiSprite.png|frame|Mai's sprite in ''HSiFS'']]
Emerging alongside their master, Okina, she orders her servants to find others worthy of serving her. To do so, they plant doors on the backs of others and empower them, to bring out their best and test them. What they don't know, however, is that they aren't searching for allies, like Okina told them, but for their own replacements.
;[[Violet Detector]]
She is the boss on non-Wednesday together with Satono.

==Relationships==
;[[Okina Matara]]
Okina is Mai and Satono's master. They are vessels of her power, acting as extensions of her and unflinchingly obeying her orders. They are becoming less human due to Okina's influence. They have little memory of their past, yet maintain their personality. Whether because they're no longer useful or she pities them, Okina seeks to replace them, which she has periodically. However, after failing to find successors, Okina says she is fine with retaining them. Satono and Mai do not know they are even searching for their own replacements.
;[[Satono Nishida]]
Satono is a fellow servant under Okina.

==Additional Information==
*She is one of ''two'' characters to be given the name Mai, the other being [[Mai]] from the PC-98 era.
*Mai is the only female ''bokkuko'' character in the series, using ''boku'' to refer to herself. This is a trait common in media of tomboys, but also of energetic, or socially unrefined characters who are unaware or uncaring of social norms.
*The silhouette of Mai, along with [[Satono Nishida]] and [[Okina Matara]], appear on the jewel case for Hidden Star in Four Seasons.
**Satono, Mai, and [[Yachie Kicchou]] are the sole Windows-era non-final or extra bosses to appear alongside the final boss on the game's jewel case.

Species: Human (?)&lt;br /&gt;
Ability: Capable of drawing out people's mental energy by dancing behind them (Satono)&lt;br /&gt;
Ability: Capable of drawing out people's vitality by dancing behind them (Mai)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

A pair whose purpose is to draw out the latent abilities of all things. Okina's subordinates.&lt;br /&gt;
They used to be regular human children, but due to Okina's magic power, they're becoming less and less human.&lt;br /&gt;
They hardly have any memory of their time as humans, and they dance in joyful madness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

However, their personalities are the same as when they were human. Mai is a scatterbrain, but she's quick to take action.&lt;br /&gt;
Satono is discreet, but slightly overconfident at times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Their dances aren't meant for people to enjoy, and are in fact quite eccentric.&lt;br /&gt;
They dance all for Okina's sake, and take action all for Okina's sake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

The two of them don't know that the doors on people's backs are meant to search for their own successors.&lt;br /&gt;
Okina only told them that the doors are meant to search for more allies for the two of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

If they did happen to find out the truth, what action would they take?&lt;br /&gt;
In all likelihood, they'd just keep doing the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;
They can hardly even imagine going against Okina's orders, after all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

They serve Okina as her loyal servants, but their abilities, too, are nothing more than an extension of Okina's.

{{nihongo|'''Mamizou Futatsuiwa'''|二ッ岩　マミゾウ|Futatsuiwa Mamizou}} is a [[Tanuki|Bake-danuki]], summoned by [[Nue Houjuu]], who originally lived in [[wikipedia:Sado,_Niigata|Sado]] in the [[Outside World]] in order to act as the [[Myouren Temple]]'s trump card against the newly-arrived residents of the [[Hall of Dreams' Great Mausoleum]], particularly [[Toyosatomimi no Miko]]. She is able to morph both herself and other creatures into different forms and can disguise herself as a [[human]].

==General Information==
Mamizou first appeared as the Extra stage [[boss]] of ''[[Ten Desires]]''. She then appeared as a playable character of ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'', she was a 6th and 8th Day Boss of ''[[Impossible Spell Card]]'' and a Playable Character in ''[[Urban Legend in Limbo]]'' and ''[[Antinomy of Common Flowers]]''. She is a recurring character in ''[[Forbidden Scrollery]]''.

She is a [[Tanuki|bake-danuki]] of proper lineage, and a [[youkai]] of the [[Outside World]] who has been called over by [[Nue Houjuu]] (by her own judgement), as a means of resistance since the [[Saint]] who sings of youkai extermination, [[Toyosatomimi no Miko]], revived. After the quarrel, she started living in the [[Myouren Temple]]. She was originally from [[wikipedia:Sado, Niigata|Sado]] along with the [[human]]s there, and before the events of ''[[Ten Desires]]''' Extra stage, passed through the [[Great Hakurei Barrier]] to enter Gensokyo.

===Personality===
Mamizou, proud of her race's esteem, is good natured, albeit with a mischievous streak. She speaks the way an old lady might, and occasionally squints as if she was nearsighted. She isn't one to take a grudge, but as [[Marisa Kirisame]] in her extra stage shows she has her limits of niceness. She does enjoy pulling pranks on [[human]]s and watching them be confused and flustered. Perhaps because in the latter half of ''[[Ten Desires]]'', there were many characters who engage in things while they actually had ulterior motives, in one part, it can be said "Mamizou is the conscience of this game." In the game, she talked in a light friendly way, and because the way she spoke indicated "training", it seems that she currently is very confident in her power as a [[youkai]].

Her first person pronoun is {{nihongo|"washi"|儂}}, which is entirely an old person's way of speaking. Nevertheless, this seems to be her way of saying things, and not so much because a belief of having aged &lt;ref&gt; ''[[Ten Desires]]'' - [[Ten Desires/Story/Sanae's Scenario|Sanae's Scenario]]'' &lt;/ref&gt;, more knowing she gets annoyed when people calls her ''old''. &lt;ref&gt; "Pardon me?! I'm still a young lass!" ''[[Forbidden Scrollery]]'' - Chapter 52 &lt;/ref&gt; Since the bake-danuki who showed up in ''[[Oriental Sacred Place]]'' also used "washi", it might just be that all tanuki use old people's way of speaking. 

Despite being brought in as a 'trump card', she is noted as being friendly with humans, and has been seen taking on the form of a human while in the [[Human Village]]. According to the omake text of ''[[Ten Desires]]'', "sometimes she'd trick them, but she'd also lend money to the poor and worked diligently on any task she was given, so she integrated well into human society", showing that she is reliable and kind at heart. Though she is seen in the Human Village often in human form, ''[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]]'' has stated that she does not make an effort to hide her tail, considering it a mark of her high status.

However, she doesn't get along with [[kitsune]], and in ''[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]]'', Mamizou says that [[wikipedia:Sado, Niigata|Sado]] is a country entirely of bake-danuki, and not a single fox can be found there. It's said that if she encounters one, there will be trouble &lt;ref name="TDP"&gt; Mamizou's profile - ''[[Ten Desires]]'' &lt;/ref&gt;.

===Abilities===
[[File:FS_Mamizou.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Mamizou disguised as a [[human]] in ''[[Forbidden Scrollery]]'']]
;Disguising things and herself
This is the ability to disguise things (including herself). Similar to [[Nue Houjuu]]'s ability, it is an ability to make the appearance of things different from what they looked like originally. As opposed to Nue who relies on how [[human]]s recognizes how it appears, Mamizou depends on her own conception. 

Mamizou is able to completely disguise herself save for her large tail and her ears, which appears to be a commonality among all bake-danuki. In order to get around this, she can shrink them or camouflage them, but if she is surprised or excited her ears and tail will twitch, making it a dead giveaway. &lt;ref name="SoPM"&gt; Mamizou's Article - ''[[Symposium of Post-mysticism/Mamizou Futatsuiwa|Symposium of Post-mysticism]]'' &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; [[Hieda no Akyuu]]: "I mean, come on, I keep getting glimpeses of her tail popping out whenever she gets careless" ''[[Forbidden Scrollery]]'' - Chapter 47 &lt;/ref&gt; Another give away would be her smell.&lt;ref&gt;Nitori and Marisa's story modes in [[Hopeless Masquerade]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Her disguising abilities gain power on nights of the full moon. Since [[tanuki]] like to do things like disguising people to take on a bewildering look, they rarely do inflict direct damage. The meaning of 'disguising things' is something that resembles the fellow [[Nue (Species)|nue]], and thus mutually, they do not appear to play the role of close-range combat [[youkai]]. Thus it is a possibility that Nue has called Mamizou over with the consideration that "since the opponent can hear ten people's conversations at the same time, one has no choice but to call over a suitable youkai for splitting into 10 + 1 = 11."

She is also able to disguise other objects. However, if there is no resemblance between the base object and the disguised one, it will probably be seen through immediately, especially in regard to creatures.

While the ability is described as a simple disguise, it isn't a mere illusion and actually influences and changes the physical properties of the target. For instance, in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'', she can turn the opponent into something [[Hopeless_Masquerade/Spell_Cards/Mamizou_Futatsuiwa#Spell_Card_3|completely harmless]], and her underlings seem to obtain the properties of whatever they transform into, becoming able to attack by blowing steam after they [[Hopeless_Masquerade/Spell_Cards/Mamizou_Futatsuiwa#Spell_Card_2|transform into a giant teapot]].

;Other Abilities
Mamizou possesses the ability to travel in and out of Gensokyo, but the mechanism she uses to do this has not been explained.

===Occupation===
Mamizou's role is to become a strong ally in the youkai forces. She did provide loans and other assistance to humans in her pre-Gensokyo days.

==Character Design==
[[File:ThGKMamizou.png|thumb|right|200px|Mamizou, as illustrated in ''[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]]'']]
===Origin===
Due to sayings from her specifications and sayings that indicate that she has bad relations with [[kitsune]], Mamizou is probably based on Japan's three famous tanuki, [[Wikipedia:Danzaburou-danuki|Danzaburou-danuki]] of [[Wikipedia:Sado, Niigata|Sado Island]], one of the most famous tanuki in Japanese folklore, along with [[Wikipedia:Yashima_no_Hage-tanuki|Hage Danuki]] of [[Wikipedia:Yashima, Kagawa|Yashima]] and [[Wikipedia:Shibaemon-tanuki|Shibaemon Tanuki]] of [[Wikipedia:Awaji Island|Awaji Island]]. He was the boss of tanuki on Sado, who drove off the foxes from the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aikawa-yamaki.com/?eid=8|title=Secret Sado #2 - Aikawa Yamaki Hotel Blog|author=eyamaki|date=5 April 2010|accessdate=15 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another, Danzaburo was a money lender, who freely loaned money to the people. He was also said to be responsible for mirages at Futatsu-iwa, a rock formation in Aikawa, Sado.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=EIk0AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA85&amp;lpg=RA2-PA85&amp;dq=Danzaburo+tanuki&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=vwrFIqLOhl&amp;sig=W5LJhJpXZQriKI8hmW1DZvWasPo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=c2VITr2VJI_CsQLD2_ySCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Danzaburo%20tanuki&amp;f=false|title=Transactions of the Asiatic Society of Japan, Volume 36|author=Asiatic Society of Japan|date=1908|publisher=The Society|accessdate=15 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those tanuki however were great [[youkai]] who possessed divinity and were recorded as {{nihongo|"Futatsuiwa Daimyoujin"|二ッ岩大明神}}.

===Name===
Her full name is {{nihongo|''Mamizou Futatsuiwa''|二ッ岩　マミゾウ}}. {{nihongo|''Futatsuiwa''|二ッ岩}} literally translates to "two stones", refers to a location in Sado where bake-danuki were prevalent, and to a [https://momijiaoi.net/futatsuiwa/ shrine] located there dedicated to Danzaburo-danuki. The name {{nihongo|''Mami''|マミ}} can be considered to be or referenced to the {{nihongo|''[[wikipedia:ja:猯|mami]]''|猯||lit. "badger" or "racoon dog"}} indicating tanuki and mujina, or the {{nihongo|''mami''|魔魅|| lit. "deceiving spirit"}} indicating monsters who deceived humans, with the "za" of "danzaburou" added on. (In actuality, in Minato, Tokyo, there is a place called [[wikipedia:Azabu-Mamianachō, Minato, Tokyo|"Mami-ana" ({{lang|ja|狸穴}})]].)

===Design===
Mamizou has brown eyes and light-brown, shoulder length hair. She is featured with tanuki ears and a giant striped tail. On her head there lays a green leaf like that of a tanuki and she has glasses. She has a ecru shirt and her skirt is red-grey with some patterns on it. As with most bake-danuki from Japanese myths, Mamizou carries things on her back that look like a bottle of sake and a booklet of promissory notes. In ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'', when she gets hit or performs certain attacks, she can be seen wearing grey bloomers.

When visiting the [[Human Village]] she uses a human disguise, without her raccoon ears or tail. In this form, she has long hair, a checkered scarf and large robe, and wears a leaf-shaped hair clip.

[[File:Th13MamizouSprite.png|frame|Mamizou's sprite in ''TD'']]
[[File:Th13MamizouReimuSprite.png|frame|Mamizou's sprite in ''TD'' disguised as Reimu]]
Mamizou has the title "The Bake-danuki with Ten Transformations" with theme music "Futatsuiwa from Sado". Mamizou is secretly called in by [[Nue Houjuu]] from the [[outside world]] to become a strong ally on the [[youkai]] side against [[Toyosatomimi no Miko]] and her faction. She arrives late however and Miko had already been defeated by the heroines. She later takes up residence at [[Myouren Temple]].
:{{Main|Ten Desires/Story/Reimu's Extra|l1=Reimu Arc}}
In Reimu's story, Mamizou reveals that she crossed the sea of Sado in order to reach Gensokyo and criticizes Reimu for underestimating the vastness of the sea.
:{{Main|Ten Desires/Story/Marisa's Extra|l1=Marisa Arc}}
Mamizou sees through all of Marisa's lies. She also notes that her power is strong enough to be "within the top three" of the transforming tanuki in Japan.
:{{Main|Ten Desires/Story/Sanae's Extra|l1=Sanae Arc}}
Despite Sanae's mission to exterminate youkai, the two appear to have a friendly duel. Sanae, though, assumes that the bake-danuki is fairly old due to her language—many of the inflections and word choices used by older people in Japan resemble those used decades, even centuries, ago—and in this misunderstanding gives the youkai some encouragement. Mamizou tells her that her old language is merely a habit.[[File:Mamizou-WaHH9.png|thumb|right|Mamizou, [[Kyouko Kasodani|Kyouko]], and [[Kogasa Tatara|Kogasa]] at the [[Hakurei Shrine]] in ''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'']] 
:{{Main|Ten Desires/Story/Youmu's Extra|l1=Youmu Arc}}
Mamizou tells Youmu that she came to give the youkai there some encouragement in their fight against [[Toyosatomimi no Miko]]. She offers to train Youmu, and after she is defeated, jokes that the half-ghost is worthy to be her apprentice. Mamizou does not appear to know about the Myouren Temple itself until Youmu explains, and finds the presence of both a youkai temple and a youkai-exterminating shrine (the [[Hakurei Shrine]]) in Gensokyo quite interesting. Mamizou invites her into the temple to rest and to talk about Sado.

===Spin-offs===
;''Hopeless Masquerade''
She plays a key role in helping all of the characters. As the penultimate boss of each character's route except her own, she directs each character to the source of the problems. Before her route, she directs each character to [[Hata no Kokoro]]. During her own route, she helps Kokoro by steering her in the right direction for creating her own unique personality. In Kokoro's route, Mamizou directs Kokoro to the final four-way fight with Reimu, Byakuren, and Miko.

;''Impossible Spell Card''
:{{Main|Impossible Spell Card#Story|l1=Impossible Spell Card: Story}}
Later on in the game, Mamizou appears to have taken note of the wanted [[amanojaku]] [[Seija Kijin]]. She confronts her and says that the [[tengu]] (presumably [[Aya Shameimaru]] and [[Hatate Himekaidou]]) have taken notice of her and have written up a newspaper about her mischief. This causes stronger [[youkai]] and [[human]]s such as [[Marisa Kirisame]], [[Sakuya Izayoi]], [[Sanae Kochiya]] and [[Youmu Kompaku]] – including Mamizou – to try and capture Seija. Also, she notes that Seija can use two items simultaneously rather than one, which made her curious why Seija weren't using this technique in the first place. She uses [[spell card]]s that are considered impossible to dodge.

;''Urban Legend in Limbo''
Mamizou assists Kasen and the rest of the characters in setting up a trap that will draw the Outside World human [[Sumireko Usami]] into Gensokyo, with the intention of teaching her a lesson about the danger caused by her actions. In her own route, she goes to the Outside World and fights Sumireko herself.

;''Antinomy of Common Flowers''
In ''[[Antinomy of Common Flowers]]'', Mamizou seeks to be the strongest Perfect Posession user. She teams up with [[Fujiwara no Mokou]], who doesn't share the same ambition, but is looking for some new excitement nonetheless. They eventualy challenge the culprits of the incident, [[Joon Yorigami|Joon]] and [[Shion Yorigami]]. Mamizou and Mokou are forced to fight each other in the end.

Mamizou's [[Dream World]] self appears in Joon and Shion's route with plans of taking over Gensokyo.

===Literature===
;''Wild and Horned Hermit''
In chapter 9, after a strange 'black mist' assails the residents of the Myouren Temple and others, Mamizou pays a visit to the [[Hakurei Shrine]] accompanied by [[Kogasa Tatara]] and [[Kyouko Kasodani]], suspecting [[Reimu Hakurei]] as the culprit. Days later, [[Suika Ibuki]] reveals herself as the true attacker.

In chapter 26, Mamizou investigates the rumor of a youkai near the village, simultaneously with [[Reimu]] and [[Marisa]]. Afterwards, she appears in the [[Hakurei Shrine]] to explain to Reimu and Marisa about the "urban legends", very popular in the outside world. Soon after [[Kasen Ibara]] appears with a dog which Kasen says it is the youkai of the rumors. At the end, the four share information of what could happen and the link to the urban legends.

In chapter 32, she finds [[Kasen Ibara]] and tells her that Reimu was going to host a setsubun event. After talking with [[Reimu]] and [[Marisa]], Kasen goes investigate the [[Human Village]] after Reimu comments that the organizer said he didn't do any event, even though he was present. There, she finds sardine heads with holly branches, an oni repellent put by Mamizou to confirm her suspicions about Kasen being an oni.

Later, Mamizou and some tanukis appear in the cherry blossoms viewing Kasen hosts, and Mamizou duels the [[hermit]] to a drinking contest, which Mamizou loses after being tricked by Kasen.

;''Forbidden Scrollery''
She appears in each chapter in some sort of role, usually disguised as a human, taking an interest in youkai books and in some of the recent incidents that came about as a result of them. Her reasons for her interest and disguising herself are currently unknown.

In chapter 47, after knowing [[Aya Shameimaru]] was using her newspaper to control the information, she requests [[Hieda no Akyuu]] to write a story about the friendship about a tanuki and a human. However, Akyuu realises her true identity and tells [[Kosuzu Motoori]] that Mamizou is a youkai.

In chapter 49, Mamizou fights the youkai of the Night Parade of One Hundred Demons scroll, and defeats it to save Kosuzu.

;''Lotus Eaters''
Mamizou first appears to kidnap a drunk regular customer from [[Geidontei]], sending her tanuki to take the customer away to an unknown place. She later demands [[Miyoi Okunoda]] to leave Geidontei, using the hostage customer as leverage due to the suspicion that will befall the zashiki-warashi should a customer disappears. A distraught Miyoi ends up requesting help from [[Suika Ibuki]], who proceeds to "take care" of the problem. Later at night, Mamizou shows up in Geidontei and reveals that she collaborating with Suika to get Miyoi to keep Geidontei open at night for Youkai. She promises to wait for regular customers to leave.

==Relationships==
===Residents of the Myouren Temple===
Since Mamizou lives at the [[Myouren Temple]], she should know most of the residents living here, including the leader [[Byakuren Hijiri]] herself, although there has rarely any interaction. [[Kyouko Kasodani]] claims that Mamizou will listen to the problems and concerns of those living at the temple with open ears &lt;ref&gt; ''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'' - Chapter 9 &lt;/ref&gt;. [[Nue Houjuu]] was the one to call Mamizou to [[Gensokyo]] during ''[[Ten Desires]]'', and they are described as being friends, and are shown conspiring in Chapter 31 of Forbidden Scrollery, where Mamizou and her tanuki assist Nue in frightening the humans in the Human Village with an Urban Legend of The Bull's Head.

===Minor Relationships===
;[[Hata no Kokoro]]
At the end of Mamizou's storyline in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'', she urged [[Hata no Kokoro]] to, through battle with other characters in the game, learn how to control her emotions and to "discover herself" instead of becoming a mere tsukumogami for Sarugaku masks.

;[[Kosuzu Motoori]]
In ''[[Forbidden Scrollery]]'', Mamizou became a regular customer of [[Kosuzu Motoori]] with an interest in the [[Demon book]]s, and talks with Kosuzu warmly. By the end of the manga, Mamizou becomes quite protective of Kosuzu, going so far as to protect her from the "old school" youkai she happens upon.

;[[Kasen Ibaraki]]
Kasen and Mamizou first meet at winter after the events of [[Ten Desires]] during an incident where a mysterious black mist was attacking the residents of [[Myouren Temple]], which resulted to be [[Suika Ibuki]]. Later, during the beginning of the Urban Legends incident they found a man-faced dog and tried to find a reason for these ocurrences appearing in Gensokyo. During the [[Urban Legend in Limbo|peak of the incident]] they confronted twice, when Mamizou found Kasen opening a hole in the barrier to the Outside World and made a deal with her to keep her mouth shut and look after potential intruders while Kasen was gone &lt;ref&gt; ''[[Urban Legend in Limbo]]'' - [[Urban Legend in Limbo/Story/Kasen's Scenario|Kasen's Scenario]] &lt;/ref&gt;. Later Mamizou decided to play as the villain and decided to interfere with Kasen's plan to fight the responsible of the incident, [[Sumireko Usami]], with the benefit to move easily around the Outside World &lt;ref&gt; ''[[Urban Legend in Limbo]]'' - [[Urban Legend in Limbo/Story/Mamizou's Scenario|Mamizou's Scenario]] &lt;/ref&gt;. She tricked Sumireko to explore Gensokyo and, in the meantime, put in motion Kasen's plan to scare her while she wandered freely. Then, with Reimu aprehending Sumireko, Kasen and Mamizou confronted her and Mamizou promised to look after her. As seen in [[Wild and Horned Hermit]], Mamizou became worried of Kasen's influence over the Hakurei Shrine and how obviously she was an [[oni]] so she set some oni repelling traps to provoke Kasen. After seeing this, Kasen organized a flower viewing event at the shrine to confront Mamizou in a drinking contest. Kasen won the contest and earned Mamizou's respect. They attend another event where they drink together in [[Visionary Fairies in Shrine]].

;[[Miyoi Okunoda]]

Mamizou was originally hostile to Miyoi, demanding her to leave Geidontei with the threat of revealing her status as a youkai, however this was, in fact, a ploy made by both her and Suika to ensure that they could hang out at the pub on afterhours. Afterwards, Mamizou frequently visits the pub as a customer.

'''Mamizou Futatsuiwa'''

Species: Bake-danuki&lt;br /&gt;
Ability: Disguising things and herself

A bake-danuki of proper upbringing.&lt;br /&gt;
An unusual youkai that lived outside of Gensokyo.&lt;br /&gt;
She's made her way inside this time to help out an old friend in a pinch.

Tanuki take great pleasure in watching the reactions of humans
that they trick, so they seldom do direct damage. They are
more powerful on the night of a full moon.

Their ability to shapeshift makes them similar to the nue in a way.
Neither of them seem to be terribly effective youkai when it
comes to close combat.

Can this kind of youkai really hold her own against Miko?
After all, youkai are fairly self-centered and don't take or
give orders easily, so no matter how strong each one of them may be,
they'd still lose in the end.


It seems she'd lived together with humans in her home town (Sado).
Sometimes she'd trick them, but she'd also lend money to the
poor and worked diligently on any task she was given, so she
integrated well into human society.


However, She doesn't get along with foxes, so it is rumored that
no foxes live in Sado.&lt;br /&gt;
She would end up causing trouble with the foxes of Gensokyo, but that's a story for another day.

{{nihongo|'''Maribel Hearn'''|マエリベリー・ハーン|Maeriberii Haan}} is a university student in the near future of the [[outside world]] in [[Kyoto]], who forms the "[[Secret Sealing Club]]" with [[Renko Usami]]. She has no relation to [[Gensokyo]], but has often visited Gensokyo in her dreams.

She majors in relativistive psychology and sometimes has difficulty telling the difference between dream and reality (at least, in regards to [[Gensokyo]]). She believes subjectivity to be more true than objectivity. Her clan has had the ability to see [[boundary|boundaries]] since "ancient times" and seeks to dive into another world, despite such a thing being forbidden.

Together with her friend, [[Renko Usami]], she has an interest in what would be considered the paranormal. Their club, consisting of only the two of them, describes itself as a club for [[wiktionary:necromancer|necromancers]]. However, they don't do many of the things necromancers would normally be associated with. Instead, they investigate the possibility of other worlds and such. Specifically, they're interested in Gensokyo, the [[Netherworld]], and the [[Moon]], and seem to be among the few, or even the only [[human]]s from the outside world who know of Gensokyo's existence. 

==General Information==
===Abilities===   
;Ability to see boundaries
Although she's a [[human]] from the [[outside world]], she possesses the ability to see boundaries. Per Maribel's words, she simply just does. This includes the ability to see other worlds, such as seeing the far side of the [[Moon]]. She also often visits [[Gensokyo]] in her dreams, and is sometimes chased by [[youkai]]. She can even bring back physical items.&lt;ref name="CoSD"&gt;[[Changeability of Strange Dream/Story|Changeability of Strange Dream]]&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding this, considering that visiting another world is an entirely different matter compared to seeing it, Renko made the consideration that perhaps her ability has advanced to become "the ability to manipulate boundaries".

By the time of ''[[Trojan Green Asteroid]]'', she isn't only able to travel across boundaries to other worlds freely, but is also capable of taking Renko with her. However, in order to reach [[TORIFUNE]] she needed to connect the gate of a shrine to Ame-no-Torifune with that of the one within the station. Renko notes later in ''[[Neo-traditionalism of Japan]]'' that her power seems to be connected to shrines. The duo's trip to TORIFUNE wasn't the first time the two have gone adventuring to other worlds.&lt;ref&gt;[[Trojan Green Asteroid/Story|Trojan Green Astroid]] - "Every time they find a way to the other side of the boundary, they can't help but go adventuring."&lt;/ref&gt; It's noted by Maribel in ''[[Neo-traditionalism of Japan]]'' that while visiting TORIFUNE was a reality to Maribel, it was still a dream to Renko, which is why Maribel got injured by a [[chimera]] while Renko didn't. Renko privately realizes the same conclusion, recalling that the two encountered [[youkai]] during visits to other worlds that were real to Maribel but felt like figments of her imagination to Renko.

Renko notes that Maribel's power has grown rapidly stronger in ''[[Neo-traditionalism of Japan]]'', set only a few days later. She can now see beyond to the other side of boundaries and show her visions to others by putting her hands over their eyes, although the transferred visions are unstable (but still adequate). She can now travel through worlds even while awake, and consciously taking back objects from those worlds is easy for her.

==Backstory==
Maribel comes from a lineage which has had the ability to sense the supernatural since long ago&lt;ref name="CoSD" /&gt;. Because of this, she has the ability to see borders. Society wasn't receptive to strange people, so she had to keep her ability a secret.&lt;ref name="NoJ"&gt;[[Neo-traditionalism of Japan/Story|Neo-traditionalism of Japan]] - "Of course that wasn't the case, but society just isn't receptive to strange people."&lt;/ref&gt;

She's hated lycoris (flowers which represent death) ever since she was a child because "they're creepy".

As opposed to how it has been revealed that [[Renko Usami]]'s hometown is [[wikipedia:Tokyo|Tokyo]], Maribel's hometown and home country is unclear. Since she fluently speaks [[wikipedia:Japanese language|Japanese]] with Renko, she probably has lived in Japan for a long time. However, she stated in ''Neo-Traditionalism of Japan'' that she doesn't have any relatives there.

==Character Design==
[[File:ThGKPartII.png|thumb|210px|Maribel and Renko's cameo in ''[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]]'']]
===Origin===
Some aspects of Maribel appear to be based on [[wikipedia:Lafcadio Hearn|Lafcadio Hearn]], one of the first writers to spread knowledge of Japanese folklore to the West, who eventually married a Japanese woman and changed his name to Koizumi Yakumo. Lafcadio wrote several stories and baiku on the Japanese and [[wikipedia:Zen|Zen]] beliefs of butterflies and dreaming as one, which is a recurring theme for Maribel. This includes a well-known translation of the story [[Wikipedia:The Dream of Akinosuke|The Dream of Akinosuke]], where a man travelled to another world in his dreams only to find out in the end that it was real, although it turns out to be a world of ants instead of [[human]]s.

To add to this, several of Lafcadio's most well known works appear to correspond to Maribel's first four stories:
*"In '''Ghostly''' Japan" was a collection of ghost stories by Lafcadio. [[ZUN]] stated he was trying to get a ghostly mood for ''[[Ghostly Field Club|'''Ghostly''' Field Club]]''.
*"Exotics and '''Retrospectives'''" was a collection of Lafcadio's musings about Japan. It contains a large article about [[wikipedia:Mount Fuji|Mount Fuji]] as well as a discussion about Zen, musings on paintings, and about the psychology of the color blue, among various other themes such as "beauty in memory" and "literature of the dead", which are all topics and themes that show up in ''[[Retrospective 53 minutes|'''Retrospective''' 53 minutes]]''.
*[[Wikipedia:Kwaidan: Stories and Studies of Strange Things|Kwaidan: Stories and Studies of '''Strange''' Things]] is a collection of youkai horror stories, including "The Dream of Akinosuke". It would most likely have been what ''[[Changeability of Strange Dream|Changeability of '''Strange''' Dream]]'' may have been themed after, given that Maribel is dreaming in a [[youkai]] horror story of her own.
*"The Romance of the Milky Way" may possibly be what ''[[Magical Astronomy]]'' was themed after. One of the short stories in it is called "The Mirror Maiden", and ''Magical Astronomy'' ends with Maribel about to manipulate a [[boundary]] using a reflection (in essence, Maribel is a mirror maiden). It was also Lafcadio's final work (published posthumously after his death), just as ''Magical Astronomy'' was Maribel's last story (at least for an extremely long time, until ''[[Trojan Green Asteroid]]'' was released almost six years later).

===Name===
There's never been an official romanization for her name {{lang|ja|マエリベリー・ハーン}} (''Maeriberii Haan''), as well as the English spelling of her name is unclear, and "Maribel Hearn" is not an official spelling. Even ZUN does not seem to know about her name's English spelling nor origin&lt;ref&gt;[[ZUN's AWA Q&amp;A Panel]]&lt;/ref&gt;. Other than "[[wiktionary:Maribel|Maribel]]" that's Spanish origin (a Hebrew name that's a very rough approximation of the [[wikipedia:Katakana|katakana]]), there are also "Merryberry" and "Mæriberry" and the English "Maribelle".

As for her last name, "Hearn" proved to be a popular alternative to "Han" (rough approximation of the katakana), since "Hearn" is actually transcribed as {{lang|ja|ハーン}} (haan) in Japanese. Also, [[ZUN]] was asked in [[Doujin Barrier: The Work Called Touhou and the Fantasy of Game Creation|a high school open lecture]] about the relation between Maribel and Yukari, ZUN said that there was this [[wikipedia:Lafcadio Hearn|Lafcadio Hearn]] in the past. Furthermore, if you read Yukari's last name using the on reading, then "Yakumo" {{lang|ja|八雲}} becomes "Haun".

She is called "Merry" as a pet name by [[Renko Usami]] (sometimes rendered as "Mary"). It seems that Renko is not able to pronounce "Maeriberī" well. Judging by her name, Maribel may not actually be of Japanese ethnicity.

===Design===
Maribel is usually seen with blond hair, a purple dress and a white mob cap. In ''[[Changeability of Strange Dream]]'' her white cap was gone, but now has a red ribbon at her collar. In ''[[Retrospective 53 minutes]]'', she has a red bowtie around her shoes that she didn't have in ''[[Ghostly Field Club]]''. In ''[[Magical Astronomy]]'' she has her white mob cap again, but the ribbon at the collar is gone. Instead she had red shoes. On the CD illustration of ''[[Unknown Flower, Mesmerizing Journey]]'', her shoes appear to be black again and the red ribbon on her collar is back. In ''[[Trojan Green Asteroid]]'' her dress includes a belt and no ribbon. In ''[[Neo-traditionalism of Japan]]'' she wears a pale blue blouse and blue-purple skirt.

==Appearances==
;''Ghostly Field Club''
:{{Main|Ghostly Field Club/Story|l1=Ghostly Field Club Story}}
Using a photograph of the [[Netherworld]] and Renko's ability to determine location from the [[Moon]], Maribel and Renko attempt to find the entrance to the Netherworld in a ghostly field.

;''Changeability of Strange Dream''
:{{Main|Changeability of Strange Dream/Story|l1=Changeability of Strange Dream Story}}
Maribel is talking with Renko about how she is visiting [[Gensokyo|a strange world]] in her dreams. It starts out nicely but begins to become nightmarish as Maribel is attacked by [[youkai]]. Maribel has trouble figuring out what is reality and what is just a dream, and to further complicate the issue, she presents Renko with some of the items she had obtained in her dreams. Renko realizes the truth, and in the end must decide on which will be Maribel's reality.

;''Retrospective 53 Minutes''
:{{Main|Retrospective_53_minutes/Story|l1=Retrospective 53 Minutes Story}}
In ''[[Retrospective 53 minutes]]'', Maribel and Renko were on a train to Tokyo. They were looking at a simulated kaleido screen of the outside and discussing the trip, the view, and the nature of objectivity and subjectivity related to it. Renko commented on her, saying "You might be as carefree as the Tōhoku people though." The trip lasts 53 minutes.

;''Magical Astronomy''
:{{Main|Magical Astronomy/Story|l1=Magical Astronomy Story}}
The university campus is abuzz with news of public tours to the [[moon]]. Maribel and Renko talk about the world on the moon hidden from humans and eagerly try to plan their own trip to there. Maribel gets a special idea.

;''Trojan Green Asteroid''
:{{Main|Trojan Green Asteroid/Story|l1=Trojan Green Asteroid Story}}
Maribel and Renko discuss the lost micro-habitat space station [[TORIFUNE]], Maribel claiming that she has seen inside it and everything is still alive. Since the station contains a shrine to Ame-no-Torifune, they travel to another such shrine and use Maribel's ability to transport themselves there through their dreams. They discover that the interior has become a dense jungle, and are attacked by a [[chimera]]. Maribel wakes up with a cut on her arm and is sent to hospital.

;''Neo-traditionalism of Japan''
:{{Main|Neo-traditionalism of Japan/Story|l1=Neo-traditionalism of Japan Story}}
While in hospital, Maribel is diagnosed with sleepwalking and hallucinations; believing this to be a previously unknown virus, the doctors send her to the mountains for isolation treatment. By the time she's released her powers have grown stronger and she now sees visions while awake. Maribel discusses [[Hell]] with Renko, but doesn't tell her that she physically travelled to Hell while in isolation. Renko tells Maribel that while she was in isolation, the news has been talking about discoveries of stone tools more than 25 million years old, though they were dismissed as a hoax. Maribel believes otherwise, and presents one she found herself. Maribel shows Renko a vision of the underground realm where she found it, and Renko recognises the Ame-no-Sakahoko as being there. Maribel calms down, no longer believing the place she saw to be Hell but the world of the gods. The two decide to find more such "Izanagi Objects" that lie unrecognised across Japan.

;''Dr. Latency's Freak Report''
:{{Main|Dr. Latency's Freak Report/Story|l1=Dr. Latency's Freak Report Story}}
At Maribel's suggestion, the duo is planning on self-publishing a book, in which they would relate the stories of the mysterious worlds they had seen. Under the pen name of "Dr. Latency", Maribel is dictating to Renko her parts of the book, including a summary of the strange places she saw as well as her theories in her attempt to rationalize what was defying the common sense of the world.

;''Dateless Bar "Old Adam"''
:{{Main|Dateless Bar "Old Adam"/Story|l1=Dateless Bar "Old Adam" Story}}
Renko invites Maribel to the "Old Adam" bar, a special place where old-style alcohol is being served and said to be a gathering spot for those who can see illusions. Almost everyone there seems to have read the ''Swallowstone Naturalis Historia'', the self-published fanzine Maribel and Renko made before, and believe its content entirely. The duo came here to hear the stories of the locals, hoping to find valuable information or even people that may have special abilities like them.

==Possibly Relevant Facts to the Relationship Between Maribel &amp; Yukari==
[[File:YukariPCB.png|thumb|200px|Yukari's first appearance in ''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]'']]
[[ZUN]]'s answer to the above question acknowledges a relationship between Maribel and [[Yukari Yakumo]], but he only explicitly mentioned Lafcadio Hearn. The following facts and occurrences from various official sources may or may not be relevant to discerning the nature of this relationship, if it's possible to do so.

===Looks===   
Maribel and Yukari's appearances are very similar to each other. Both have the same hair color and (in most official portrayals) eye color. In addition to this, both are always depicted wearing some combination of purple and red (the opposite colors of the visible spectrum), as well as ribbons tied in the shape of an eight, which is stated to be one of the meanings of Yukari's name. Both also wear a bonnet. 

===Ability===
Both Maribel and Yukari have the ability to see boundaries. Unlike Yukari, however, Maribel is only stated to be able to see boundaries, not manipulate them. However, after Maribel told Renko about her dreams involving going to another world in ''[[Changeability of Strange Dream]]'', Renko speculates that Maribel's ability is evolving into the ability to manipulate boundaries, even though such a thing should be impossible. In later stories such as ''[[Trojan Green Asteroid]]'' and ''[[Neo-traditionalism of Japan]]'', Maribel is outright taking Renko with her to different worlds and bringing things back from them, showing that her ability has advanced far beyond merely being able to see boundaries. Her power has grown so much that "Renko couldn't help but think that Maribel was on the same level as those youkai."

One of Yukari's most famous uses of her ability was to go to the [[moon]] through its reflection on the lake. At the end of ''[[Magical Astronomy]]'', Maribel also gets an idea of how to get to the moon while looking at its reflection in the lake, although the story ends there without explicitly saying what it was.

===Dreams===
In ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'', it mentions a couple speculations by various denizens of [[Gensokyo]]. One is that Yukari is a youkai from the [[outside world]] and spends her days and winters there (the time she claims to be sleeping). Another is that the outside world is Yukari's dream. It's also stated that Yukari's ability to manipulate boundaries includes the ability to enter dreams. ''Perfect Memento in Strict Sense'' doesn't state how valid these speculations are.

Maribel herself has visited Gensokyo in her dreams. In these dreams, she appears to still be Maribel and still be a [[human]], as she says she is constantly attacked by youkai and runs from them in fear (which is the point when she typically wakes up).

===Time Period===
Maribel is descended from a lineage which has had the ability to sense the supernatural since long ago. She herself exists in a time in the near future (when her stories are stated to take place). Yukari meanwhile has existed for at least over 1,200 years before and up to the present day (when the ''[[Touhou Project]]'' takes place).

It's confirmed that travelling through time is possible in the ''Touhou Project''. [[Watatsuki no Toyohime]] mentions that rarely, time is one of the things that a [[human]] can get spirited away through in [[Cage in Lunatic Runagate/Third_Chapter|Cage in Lunatic Runagate's third chapter]]. Maribel appears to have travelled through time on at least one occasion. In ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'', there's an entry about a [[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Memorandum|mysterious memo]] found "several hundred years ago" written by a person who believes she's wandering in the [[Bamboo Forest of the Lost]] while she's dreaming, mentioning such things as a [[wikipedia:Global Positioning System|GPS]] and a cell phone, and even the phrase "I'm gonna tell [[Renko Usami|Renko]] about it when I wake up."

Going by this, Maribel was apparently herself in Gensokyo during at least two different times hundreds of years apart. In ''[[Changeability of Strange Dream]]'', Maribel visits a scarlet mansion with a maid (presumably the [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]]) at one point, and at another point gets lost in a bamboo forest (of which the events where she gets lost indicates it's the [[Bamboo Forest of the Lost]]). The memo in ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'' shows that the period in which she got lost was several hundreds of years before the present day, while the Scarlet Devil Mansion is known to have arrived in Gensokyo only recently.

===The Visit to the Moon===

Magical Astronomy ends with Maribel figuring out how to visit the moon.  By Trojan Green Asteroid, it's stated she has actually gone to several fantastical new worlds by then.

In Cage in Lunatic Runagate, Yukari tells Ran a story where a youkai had once visited the moon just to look around and play as an indirect way of explaining how Yukari already knew about the trap set for her. Yukari refused to say that youkai's name, but Ran notes that youkai must have been Yukari herself.

The trap itself was made by creating a small discrepancy in time for the moon to become full each month which builds up over a long period of time.  In Silent Sinner in Blue, Toyohime, while mocking Yukari, states that the trap takes a thousand years to be armed.

===Yukari's Original Name===
Yukari Yakumo is "probably" (quoted from [[Rinnosuke Morichika]]) not Yukari's original name. In ''[[Curiosities of Lotus Asia]]'' chapter 26, while analyzing the meaning of Yukari's name, Rinnosuke notes that Yukari is "probably" the name she chose for herself. Yukari's article in ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'' supports this by mentioning records from 1,200 years ago of a youkai that seems to be Yukari Yakumo (the wording shows those records didn't have the youkai's name recorded as Yukari Yakumo). As noted above, Maribel's namesake Lafcadio Hearn changed his name to Koizumi Yakumo when he became a Japanese citizen.

In ''[[Changeability of Strange Dream]]'', Maribel also worries (to an unknown degree of seriousness) that her real name was forgotten because Renko always calls her "Merry".

===Statements About Gensokyo's Reality===
Maribel believes that the world in her dreams (Gensokyo) is merely a dream, although it's so realistic that it leads her to panic about whether her dream is the true reality or not. Renko, however, believes that it's not a dream and that Maribel has actually visited another world. In the end, after debating on a choice which would lead Maribel to either stay in that world by convincing her it's real, or the "real" world by convincing her it's just a dream, Renko decides to tell Maribel to make her dream a reality.

In ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Memorizable Gensokyo|Memorizable Gensokyo]]'', Yukari refers to herself as the representative of [[Gensokyo]]'s reality.

===The State of Gensokyo===
''Changeability of Strange Dream'''s Japanese title translates to "Changing Dreams in the Age of Science" while the synopsis includes the statement, "Two young female mediums, changing future nightmares into sweet dreams." Within the storyline where Maribel is trapped in Gensokyo, she comments, "The dreams usually end when I'm being chased by a youkai. It certainly seems like a nightmare, no matter how you see it, although..." followed by "Though, if I could change that nightmare to a pleasant dream, different from present reality..."

Yukari doesn't say how she feels about the state of Gensokyo as it is. Certainly, there are many events through out Gensokyo's history leading up to its current state which might have involved or been caused by her, but most can't be absolutely 100% confirmed. [[Akyuu Hieda]], however, does comment in the afterword of ''Perfect Memento in Strict Sense'', "These peaceful, yet stimulating times are surely a golden age for humans and youkai alike. There's no doubt that Gensokyo has become the way it is thanks to the isolation brought about by the [[Great Hakurei Barrier]]." which was "the solution endorsed by the youkai sages" (which is confirmed to include Yukari in ''[[Subterranean Animism]]''). Yukari's own section also states she was a major supporter of the great barrier.

==Relationships==
;[[Renko Usami]]
Renko Usami is the only other member of Maribel's [[Secret Sealing Club]] and a fellow student at Maribel's university. The two are very good friends, working together to seek out other worlds, travelling by train together to Renko's hometown, discussing going to the [[moon]] together, and Maribel confiding to Renko about her travels to another world in her dreams. 

===Minor Relationships===
;[[Sakuya Izayoi]]
In one of her dreams, Maribel met a [[maid]] at a [[Scarlet Devil Mansion|mansion that was a deep scarlet]]. The details of the meeting are unknown, but it must have been a friendly one given that Maribel was allowed to take some cookies home with her. It's unknown if the maid was indeed Sakuya.

;[[Fujiwara no Mokou]]
In another one of her dreams, Maribel is rescued from a [[mouse]] or [[rabbit]] [[youkai]] by a mysterious girl surrounded by flames in the shape of a phoenix. Afraid of the girl, Maribel ran away. Although the mysterious girl is probably Mokou, it has never been explicitly confirmed.

;[[Yukari Yakumo]]
[[ZUN]] was asked in [[Doujin Barrier: The Work Called Touhou and the Fantasy of Game Creation|a high school open lecture]] about the relation between Maribel and Yukari. He said that there was this [[wikipedia:Lafcadio Hearn|Lafcadio Hearn]] and laughed.

;[[Yuyuko Saigyouji]]
Maribel encountered Yuyuko while investigating a supernatural hot spot (actually a place where ghosts come to the [[outside world]] to play). Merry didn't display any indication that she could see Yuyuko, though she appeared to feel a chill from her presence.

==Additional Information==
*One of Maribel's known theme songs is titled "Merry, the Magician" (the other is "Strange Bird of the Moon, Illusion of Mysterious Cat" that she shares with [[Renko Usami]]), but [[ZUN]] said in ''[[Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red/Music Columns|Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s music column that her theme song is "not necessarily because Merry is a magician" and she doesn't consciously perform any magical acts in any of her stories.
**However, the end of ''[[Magical Astronomy]]'' refers to Maribel as "Merry, the Magician" just as she obtains the inspiration to perform an otherworldly act. She's also similar to a [[magician]] in the professional researcher sense, because she's researching other worlds and dreams, despite her world being one where all forms of energy are supposedly unified and [[scientist|science]] has reached its peak (according to Renko). In essence, magic is the only thing left to discover. Magic and science share many parallels, and Maribel is a person researching into this phenomenom in a world where science can't be researched further. Thus "Merry, the Magician" is a fitting moniker for her.
*The actual name of Renko and Merry's club is "The [[Hifuu Club]]", not "Ghostly Field Club", as stated in ''[[Ghostly Field Club]]'' (which is a story about their club investigating a ghostly field).
*In ''[[Imperishable Night]]'', ZUN mentions in [[Kaguya Houraisan]]'s [[Imperishable Night/Spell Cards/Stage 6B#Spell Card 183|"End of Imperishable Night -Half Past 2-"]] spell card commentary that this is the time right after when the gate to after-life world has opened. He thus implies that Maribel and Renko possibly did succeed in finding the entrance to the [[Netherworld]] in ''Ghostly Field Club'', but all he has to say about it are "So, what did Renko and Merry see, at all?"
*Merry's the only [[human]] from the [[outside world]] confirmed to know the true nature of the [[Lunar Capital]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Magical Astronomy/Story#大空魔術 ～ Magical Astronomy|Magical Astronomy]]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Marisa Kirisame'''|霧雨　魔理沙|Kirisame Marisa}} is an ordinary [[human]] [[magician]] who specializes in light and heat magic and currently resides in the [[Forest of Magic]]. Her motto is: "It ain't magic if it ain't flashy. Danmaku's all about firepower,"&lt;ref name="gumon_117-120"&gt;''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'': [[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Marisa Kirisame|Marisa Kirisame]]&lt;/ref&gt; and she has a compulsive mania for collecting things. She's considered to be the deuteragonist of the ''[[Touhou Project]]'' series along with the main protagonist, [[Reimu Hakurei]].

==General Information==
Marisa is a common playable character in most games throughout the series with somewhat rare alternative roles such as being an Extra [[stage]] [[boss]]. Her first ever appearance in the ''[[Touhou Project]]'' was in the second [[PC-98]] game ''[[Story of Eastern Wonderland]]'', and she first appeared as a playable character in the third game, ''[[Phantasmagoria of Dim. Dream]]''. Additionally, she has made a guest appearance as the first Extra stage boss in the ''[[Seihou Project]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s first work ''[[Shuusou Gyoku]]''.

Marisa serves as an audience surrogate of sorts - she is straight-forward and much easier to understand than other characters, typically filling the support role. She also serves as a contrast to Reimu, who's blessed with innate abilities, by being the hard-working type of character without any special powers. [[ZUN]] has said that this makes her a rather "un-Touhou-like" character, but also gives him much more leeway in creating a story.&lt;ref&gt;[[Strange Creators of Outer World/Who's Who of Humans &amp; Youkai in Gensokyo/Marisa Kirisame|Strange Creators of Outer World - Marisa Kirisame]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Silent Sinner in Blue/Interview with ZUN|Silent Sinner in Blue interview]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Marisa's height is that of a girl in her early teens and is in the "fairly short" group.&lt;ref&gt;[[ZUN's E-mails]]&lt;/ref&gt;. Unlike [[Patchouli Knowledge]] and [[Alice Margatroid]], who are magicians by species, she's merely an ordinary [[human]] who uses magic. In the games themselves, she's a character who consistently stresses high power and quick speed. She exceeds in attack and penetration power, but her attack range is generally narrow. Her signature move is the tremendous laser [[spell card]], ''Love Sign "Master Spark&lt;nowiki&gt;"&lt;/nowiki&gt;''. She has good speed and power, but poor melee technique.&lt;ref&gt;[[Shanghai Alice Correspondence]] - ''[[Immaterial and Missing Power]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personality===

Outwardly, Marisa is an outgoing and informal individual. She socializes with many inhabitants of [[Gensokyo]] and is friendly to both human and non-humans individuals, although still remaining wary around [[youkai]]. She's quick to act if she hears or sees anything interesting; sometimes doing dangerous things to satiate her interest at the time. An example is when she follows an eagle on a whim in the middle of a blizzard.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wild and Horned Hermit]], chapter 10&lt;/ref&gt; She speaks in an informal manner and typically uses the sentence ending particle {{nihongo||ぜ|ze}}. "Ze" used at the end of verb stems delivers a "boyish" and "impolite" sound to the listener/reader. ''Ze'' is mostly used in a context to express one's will to act (similar to "let's" in English), and using it in other cases sound somewhat unnatural, perhaps "phony" or "showy".

In the past, Marisa was known to be a habitual liar. Such as when she claimed to be [[Reimu Hakurei]] to avoid being troubled by [[Flandre Scarlet]] &lt;ref&gt;[[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]], Extra Stage&lt;/ref&gt; or when she blamed various crimes to [[Alice Margatroid]] to get Reimu out of the way.&lt;ref&gt;[[Imperishable Night]], stage 4&lt;/ref&gt; However, she puts no effort into actually deceiving anyone as her lies are extremely obvious. Over time, this tendency to lie has decreased and she's more likely to tell the truth to others. By the time of ''Wily Beast and Weakest Creature'', she willingly tells [[Saki Kurokoma]] to come to her place and emphasises that it is not the shrine.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wily Beast and Weakest Creature]], Marisa's Extra (Eagle)&lt;/ref&gt; Although that could be because she was possessed by the proud Eagle spirit.

She has a mania for collecting things and exhibits knowledge of various valuable and/or magical objects around Gensokyo. She has been frequently seen foraging (or looting) in many places for various materials, be it mushrooms, parts of a dragon, or just whatever she thinks looks interesting at the time. That said, her hoarding habit does result in her not knowing or forgetting what objects are in her house.

Though she goes to great lengths to hide it,&lt;ref name="gumon_117-120"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Marisa is a hard Working individual who frequently seeks to better herself and seeks to be known as a great magician.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Grimoire of Marisa]]'': [[The Grimoire of Marisa/Foreword|Foreword]]&lt;/ref&gt; She takes pride in her magic and youkai extermination capabilities, claiming to be "the number two in Gensokyo".&lt;ref&gt;[[Strange and Bright Nature Deity]] - Chapter 10&lt;/ref&gt; She does indeed care for the sake of Gensokyo and its inhabitants, but conceals it with her rowdiness. In many cases, she is the one who would push Reimu to investigate potential incidents.

===Abilities===
; Strength 
Marisa is a normal human with no innate abilities, but her true strength lies in her ability to use one of the highest classes of magic power that [[human]]s can use – an unusual feat perhaps only possible because of the effects of the [[Forest of Magic]].&lt;ref name="gumon_117-120"/&gt; She's also faced very powerful humans and [[youkai]] and was able to solve a number of incidents in various scenarios, all being high achievements. However, her existence is closest to an ordinary person; she was born without any innate abilities (unlike [[Reimu Hakurei]]) and has been compared to "humans of a level close to us" by [[ZUN]]. As a result, the interpretations of Marisa's power can go to extremes. She has an attachment to power and has self-belief in ostentatious display of power. She always finds opponents to fight and plays by finding faults. However, she's actually a hard worker, and her power is the result of her secret training.&lt;ref name="SGZUN"&gt;''[[Shuusou Gyoku]]'': {{lang|ja|創曲幻想}}.txt&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Marisa appears to have developed an innate resistance against poisonous substances, due to her gathering of mushrooms and living in the Forest of Magic.

Despite her small size, Marisa is surprisingly physically strong. In chapter 16 of ''[[Curiosities of Lotus Asia]]'', she carried out a big computer out of Kourindou in her arms. In ''[[Forbidden Scrollery]]'', she was shown jumping over the walls of the Hieda mansion&lt;ref&gt;[[Forbidden Scrollery]] - Chapter 7&lt;/ref&gt; and was seen climbing youkai mountain manually (instead of just flying)&lt;ref&gt;[[Forbidden Scrollery]] - Chapter 45&lt;/ref&gt;. In Marisa's otter route of ''[[Wily Beast and Weakest Creature]]'', [[Urumi Ushizaki]] tried to drown Marisa using her stone baby but ends up being amazed that Marisa is able to hold onto it despite its weight. She was also able to lift [[Sunny Milk]] and hold her up at waist height with only one hand, and without putting any apparent effort in doing so.&lt;ref&gt;[[Visionary Fairies in Shrine]] - Chapter 9.5&lt;/ref&gt;

; Using magic
[[File:SSiBArtChapter191.jpg|thumb|192px|Marisa in ''[[Silent Sinner in Blue]]''.]]
Marisa has trained herself in magic that specialises in light and heat. She's an Eastern [[magician]] who takes a Western approach to magic, the opposite of [[Patchouli Knowledge]]. Her magic has tremendous power and few weaknesses, but it has few non-destructive uses, so she uses it for flashy youkai extermination more than anything. Her magic makes for a good danmaku show, but this is made possible only through her strenuous honest effort in creating layered effects. The majority of her spells rely on power over finesse and are themed after stars and other astronomical phenomena. According to ''Perfect Memento in Strict Sense'', it's strange for a human to have mastery of magic of this level.

Marisa picks and collects various exotic mushrooms that live in the [[Forest of Magic]]. She boils them, crushes them, dries them, and furthermore mixes them, making strange chemicals or medicine. By heating them, submerging them into water, or by throwing things in directly, through trial and error, she finds a pattern from which magic-like materials come forth. Success or failure, she records the details of each experiment.&lt;ref name="gumon_117-120" /&gt; In her house, there are a ton of various handmade grimoires.

Prior to starting her research in ''The Grimoire of Marisa'', Marisa did not use complex slave-type attacks, as she was only capable of using slaves that circle around her (her guest appearance in ''Shuusou Gyoku'' notwithstanding).&lt;ref&gt;[[The Grimoire of Marisa/Parsee Mizuhashi's Spell Cards|The Grimoire of Marisa - Parsee Mizuhashi's Spell Cards]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[The Grimoire of Marisa/Marisa Kirisame's Spell Cards|The Grimoire of Marisa - Marisa Kirisame's Spell Cards]]&lt;/ref&gt;

; Flying
[[File:ThGK Kakashi4.jpg|thumb|200px|Fight between Marisa and [[Cirno]] in ''[[Fairy Wars]]'', as shown in ''[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]]'']]
Marisa is almost always depicted as riding on her broom when she flies in the sky. In the fighting spinoffs prior to ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'' she rides a broom only during some of her assault skills, like ''Witch Leyline'' and ''Stardust Reverie''. However, the more recent aerial fighters show Marisa making an extensive and continuous use of her broom, to the point that there isn't a single moment in which she isn't riding or holding it. In ''Great Fairy Wars'', her broom is nowhere in sight. ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'' states she uses the magic broom to ride around on because she believes it's an essential tool for a magician. It was originally a normal broom but sprouted leaves as a side effect of Marisa using it in magic rituals. 

In the [[PC-98]] games, she's typically shown to use a vine in place of her broom in her boss appearances (with the notable exception of ''Phantasmagoria of Dim.Dream'' where she has illusionary wings instead), but her ''Lotus Land Story'' and ''Mystic Square'' endings show her using a broom. In ''Shuusou Gyoku'', she's depicted with angel wings.

; Speed
Marisa seems to take pride in her own speed,&lt;ref name "MoF cross"&gt;[[Strange Creators of Outer World/Introduction of Previous Works/Mountain of Faith/Cross Review]]&lt;/ref&gt; which is potentially among the fastest for a human. When she used ''Double Spark'' against [[Watatsuki no Yorihime]] in [[Silent Sinner in Blue]], she moved some meters away from the first laser fast enough that she was able to shoot a second one before the first reached the Moon princess.&lt;ref&gt;[[Silent Sinner in Blue]] - Chapter 15&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[ZUN]] has mentioned that [[Aya Shameimaru]] is the fastest in [[Gensokyo]], and Marisa appears to consider Aya extremely fast,&lt;ref&gt;[[The Grimoire of Marisa/Aya Shameimaru's Spell Cards]]&lt;/ref&gt; and a worthy challenger in terms of speed,&lt;ref name "MoF cross" /&gt; so while there is the idea that Marisa is really fast, there might be other characters that are faster than her.

Marisa's high speed is echoed in the games, usually by giving her the fastest or one of the fastest movement speed.

; Learning other people's moves
[[File:Marisa'sCopyComparison.png|thumb|200px|A comparison between the originator of an attack and Marisa's copy of it.]]
Marisa's ''Love Sign "Non-directional Laser"'' was copied from [[Patchouli Knowledge]]'s regular attack from ''[[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]]'' as confirmed by [[ZUN]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Imperishable Night]]'': [[Imperishable Night/Spell Cards/Stage 4B#Spell Card 087|spell card 087]]&lt;/ref&gt; Other than that, there are also others suggested to have been stolen; ''Love Sign "Master Spark"'' greatly resembles [[Yuuka Kazami]]'s and [[Gengetsu]]'s laser from ''[[Lotus Land Story]]'', her "Orreries Sun" resembles [[Mima]]'s orreries, and "Cold Inferno" resembles [[Remilia Scarlet]]'s familiar in ''[[Imperishable Night]]''. However, there's no official evidence that these are copied moves.

It's unknown if Marisa is inherently talented at imitating others' moves, or if she simply manages to do so due to sheer effort. She uses her [[mini-Hakkero]] to use the Master Spark, while Yuuka uses her version of the laser through other means.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Grimoire of Marisa]]'': [[The Grimoire of Marisa/Marisa Kirisame's Spell Cards|Marisa Kirisame's spell cards]]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, her copying of the Master Spark seems more analogous to a person copying a fire-breathing dragon by using a flamethrower rather than a person copying a fire-breathing dragon by breathing flames merely through observation. Marisa also states that she can't imitate [[Kaguya Houraisan]]'s spell cards as they use special items that she doesn't possess.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Grimoire of Marisa]]'': [[The Grimoire of Marisa/Kaguya Houraisan's Spell Cards|Kaguya Houraisan's Spell Cards]]&lt;/ref&gt; In that case, it's analogous to a person being unable to copy a fire-breathing dragon since there are no devices on hand.

It's unlikely her implied tendency to copy other's moves is abnormal, as magicians such as Marisa build upon the work of others. Marisa claims in ''[[The Grimoire of Marisa]]'' that it's "magicians who build on observation", while [[Patchouli Knowledge]] uses the pride of magicians to add their own original touch to another's work while preserving and respecting the original.&lt;ref name="SSiBCh6"&gt;''[[Silent Sinner in Blue]]'' Chapter 6&lt;/ref&gt; Magicians seek the truth according to Patchouli.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]'': [[Touhou Hisoutensoku/Translation/Patchouli's Script|Patchouli's Script]]&lt;/ref&gt; They act like researchers in this sense, building upon the work of others. However, other magicians such as Patchouli and [[Alice Margatroid]] haven't been depicted using imitations as blatant as Marisa's for spell cards.

===Occupation===
It isn't directly stated how Marisa makes a living. She does state in ''[[Strange and Bright Nature Deity]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'s&lt;/nowiki&gt; 9th chapter that she regularly goes to the [[Hakurei Shrine]] to take away Reimu's [[youkai]] extermination jobs and ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'' implies it as well, making it a likely source of income. She's also written a book called ''[[The Grimoire of Marisa]]'' that reviews various [[spell card]]s by different owners of a spell; she's shown a desire to try and sell the book.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Grimoire of Marisa]]'': [[The Grimoire of Marisa/Foreword|Foreword]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]'': [[Touhou Hisoutensoku/Translation/Marisa's Script|Marisa's Script]]&lt;/ref&gt; She has been shown to peddle magic or lucky charms, the origin of these charms are dubious but she has, at least once, successfully sold a supposedly tanuki-warding pot to a villager. &lt;ref&gt;[[Forbidden Scrollery]] - Chapter 39&lt;/ref&gt;

;Kirisame Magic Shop
Marisa runs a shop for anything as an attachment to her own house. Although it's her primary occupation, she's usually absent. Inside the shop, it's so unimaginably disordered that it becomes like a mini-Forest of Magic.&lt;ref name="gumon_117-120" /&gt;

''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'' provides some information on the magic shop.&lt;ref name="gumon_117-120" /&gt; Though Marisa is surprisingly honest with her services, refusing to take payment for a failed job, the shop sees little use due to its difficult-to-find location in the [[Forest of Magic]] and the ambiguity of what her services actually are. (In ''[[Touhou Sangetsusei]]'', on the Kirisame Magic Shop's signboard, other than the shop name, nothing is written but "what will you do" ({{lang|ja|なんかします}}).) The [[Three Fairies of Light]] were her first customers to her shop, but ''Perfect Memento in Strict Sense'' implies she's had other customers since then, albeit not many.

;Burglary
[[File:018Marisa.JPG|thumb|left|150px|Marisa caught committing burglary.]]
According to ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'', Marisa boldly breaks in from the front and openly says her motto "I'll be borrowing these!" while carrying things off. She mostly steals books, so she might not be the kind who steals money. Her ability to "learn other people's moves" might originate from her nature as a thief.

As opposed to how she was commented to be a "prowler" in ''[[Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red]]'', Marisa said: "My life is way shorter than yours anyway, so can't you just take back everythin' after I kick the bucket? I'm just borrowin' until then. It should be good for the stuff I'm taking that way, too." [[Aya Shameimaru]]'s response was "The contents of the excerpt are very human-like and childish".

In ''[[Subterranean Animism]]'', Marisa mentions "(being) a thief" concerning the book she stole from [[Patchouli Knowledge]]. In the Extra Stage of that game, [[Koishi Komeiji]] pointed out "Are you the doll-using thief". Afterwards, when there was nobody at the [[Moriya Shrine]], she crept in, but was discovered by [[Kanako Yasaka]] and the others and was harshly punished.

She tried to steal from [[Kasen Ibaraki]] upon learning about the hermit's treasures, but got lost and was attacked by Kasen's pet tiger after she tried to kill it for its pelt.

===Possessions===
;Magic broom
Marisa flies on a bamboo broom as part of her magician appearance. It's an ordinary broom, but constant exposure to magic has caused a curious growth to begin. Although the bamboo is dead, leaves appear to be sprouting from the handle, independently from Marisa's magic.&lt;ref name="gumon_117-120" /&gt; In the fighting games, it serves additional purposes - she uses it as a weapon for striking and shooting [[danmaku]].

; [[Mini-Hakkero]]
{{Main|Mini-Hakkero}}
The mini-Hakkero, Marisa's treasured item, is a furnace that she uses to power her signature ''Master Spark''. From the flame of a table-top stove, to that of a flamethrower, to a powerful and unmatched wide magicannon, the mini-Hakkero has a convenient range of uses.&lt;ref name="gumon_117-120" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Silent Sinner in Blue]]'': Chapter number needed&lt;/ref&gt; Marisa herself said, "I can't even think of makin' a livin' without it."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Curiosities of Lotus Asia]]'': [[Curiosities of Lotus Asia/Chapter 06|Chapter 6]]&lt;/ref&gt; It was given to Marisa by [[Rinnosuke Morichika]] as a farewell gift when Marisa left her family to live in the [[Forest of Magic]], even though it'd be risky for a girl of her age to handle.

A magic lecture related to this item was written as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"While shooting concentrate your mind, gently muttering the spell to the Mini-Hakkero. Aiming at someone you don't like, a magicannon of love will be unleashed! 

— ''[[Imperishable Night]]'': [[Imperishable Night/Spell Cards/Stage 4B#Spell Card 100|Spell card 100]] — Marisa's Magic Lecture&lt;/blockquote&gt;

;Magic Wand
Marisa wielded a magic wand during her PC-98 appearances, but afterwards it was not seen again until ''[[Undefined Fantastic Object]]''.

;Mushroom Item
Marisa carries, concealed in her skirt, a dangerous finished product of mushrooms made from mushroom magic. After throwing the item, it explodes. The fact that she conceals them in her skirt seemed dangerous even to [[Hieda no Akyuu]] as noted in ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]''.

==Character Design==
[[File:PMiSS marisa.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Marisa, as illustrated in ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]''.]]
===Name===
Her full name is {{nihongo|''Marisa Kirisame''|霧雨　魔理沙}}. Her surname {{nihongo||霧雨|Kirisame|lit. "mist rain"}} means "[[wikipedia:drizzle|drizzle]]" in Japanese. The [[wikipedia:kanji|kanji]] used in her given name {{nihongo||[[wiktionary:魔|魔]]|ma}} is highly likely to come from the "ma" in {{nihongo||'''魔'''法|'''ma'''hou|"magic"}} and with {{nihongo||[[wiktionary:理|理]]|ri}} able to be interpreted as {{nihongo|"logic/law/theory"|理|kotowari}}, it can be said that they deliver the idea of her being a magician. In addition, the kanji {{nihongo||沙|sa|lit. "small sand"}} doesn't have an actual meaning, but it's often used in Japanese given names to get the sound/look of "girlishness" (different kanji, but the same idea is used in [[Minamitsu Murasa]]'s name too).

''[[Wikipedia:Marisa (given name)|Marisa]]'' is also a female given name with origins in the Romance languages, which is a variant of Latin "[[wiktionary:maris|maris]]", meaning "of the sea", but may also mean "manly". If her name was based on this, then it's very likely to indicate Marisa's character being a mix of both Eastern and Western cultures.

''[[Story of Eastern Wonderland]]'' had her name written as {{lang|ja|魔'''[[wiktionary:梨|梨]]'''沙}} in-game, with the kanji meaning "pear". In that game's attached text files and bad endings it was written as {{lang|ja|魔'''理'''沙}}. Since then, her name is still written as {{lang|ja|魔'''理'''沙}}, so {{lang|ja|魔'''梨'''沙}} was likely a typo.

===Design===

In general, Marisa is depicted with blonde hair and yellow eyes. She wears clothes with a black and white color scheme, consisting of a black vest and skirt, white waist apron and undershirt, and a black witch hat with a white bow. Her hair is commonly braided on one side with a bow on the end. She sometimes wears dark blue clothes instead, such as in ''[[Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom]]'', ''[[Subterranean Animism]]'', or the fighting game spin offs from ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'' onwards.

Her exact appearance varies slightly between games and print works, such as having differently colored hat bows, varying hair lengths and style, and different aprons. In ''[[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]]'', she wears a white full apron with a black undershirt. In ''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]'', she wears a pink capelet and has no braid. In ''[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]'' and ''[[Ten Desires]]'', her bows are purple. She wears dark blue clothes with a blue capelet in ''[[Subterranean Animism]]''. Her outfit in ''[[Undefined Fantastic Object]]'' has a brown apron with an 'M', brown hat bow, a red bowtie, and she carries a wand. She wears a crescent moon accessory on her chest in ''[[Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom]]''. She has pink scarf and gloves and has snowflake patterns on her apron in ''[[Hidden Star in Four Seasons]]''. In ''[[Wily Beast and Weakest Creature]]'', she has cat-shaped patterns on her clothes. In ''[[100th Black Market]]'', Marisa has pale blonde hair and red eyes. Her hair flows loosely without any bows in her hair. The three rows of buttons on her outfit have been updated to be more colorful, with the upper row being yellow, the middle row being green, and the bottom row being blue. She also now has a red bowtie on her outfit.

During the [[PC-98]] era, her debut appearance in ''[[Story of Eastern Wonderland]]'' has her depicted with red hair and eyes and wearing a purple witch's outfit with a white bow on her hat (Due to the PC-98's limited colour space, purple was often used to stand-in for black outside lineart). However her appearance changes in ''[[Phantasmagoria of Dim. Dream]]'' into having blonde hair and yellow eyes more similar to her current design. This appearance stays with her for the rest of the series, up until ''[[100th Black Market]]'', where her hair and eye colors are updated. Her clothes are black in Mystic Square.

In ''[[Double Spoiler]]'', Marisa appeared as a [[stage]] Ex target, where she uses a few [[spell card]]s and had [[Aya Shameimaru]] and [[Hatate Himekaidou]] take photos of her and her [[danmaku]].

;''Fairy Wars''
[[File:Th128MarisaSprite.png|frame|Marisa's sprite in ''Fairy Wars'']]
:{{Main|Fairy Wars/Story/Extra|l1=Fairy Wars Marisa Arc}}
Marisa appears as the Extra stage [[boss]] of ''[[Fairy Wars]]''. While Marisa is returning from a flower-viewing session, [[Cirno]] shows up and asks for a fight due to Aya suggesting that Cirno should fight a human. Marisa doesn't take the request very seriously at first, but she decides to fight using her non-deadly lasers. Surprisingly, Cirno puts up a good fight and actually manages to defeat Marisa, although Cirno appears to be defeated instead, even though Marisa was going easy on her. Marisa just heads back home after the fight to rest.

;''Impossible Spell Card''

:{{Main|Impossible Spell Card#Story|l1=Impossible Spell Card: Story}}
After apparently reading the newspaper by the [[tengu]] about a mischief-making [[amanojaku]], she becomes one of the many strong [[youkai]] and [[human]]s to try and stop [[Seija Kijin]]. She uses [[spell card]]s that are considered impossible to dodge.

;''Urban Legend in Limbo''
Marisa appears as a playable character in ''[[Urban Legend in Limbo]]''. She was originally shown on a leaflet with various urban Japanese youkai with a torch/flashlight as though she's telling a spooky story. In the scenario, she discovered a phenomenon at [[Kourindou]] and took its power as herselves. [[Reimu Hakurei]] finds Marisa and wanted her to taste some mushrooms for poison, but Marisa attacked her with occult power. Reimu was confused, seeing a bizarre ball of sort. 

;''Antinomy of Common Flowers'' 
In ''[[Antinomy of Common Flowers]]'', Marisa suddenly finds herself posessed by [[Koishi Komeiji]]. Although neither seems to know how it happened, the duo decides to stick together and have fun with Perfect Posession. They wind up meeting the culprits of the incident, [[Joon Yorigami|Joon]] and [[Shion Yorigami]]. The disasterous sisters use their magic to exchange teammates, and Marisa is doomed to failure with Shion at her side.

Marisa's [[Dream World]] self appears in Joon and Shion's route, complaining that she never gets to play the lead role in incidents like [[Reimu Hakurei]] and [[Yukari Yakumo]] do.

;''Touhou Gouyoku Ibun''
After some strange black water started to emerge everywhere from the ground in the [[Forest of Magic]], Marisa goes investigate. After learning that that "black water" is called ''petroleum'' and that it could bring wealth or misfortune, she goes to the most deep area in the underground, the Former [[Hell of Blood Pools]], and there she finds [[Yuuma Toutetsu]], who thinks the magician came to steal the petroleum and attacks her.

;''Shuusou Gyoku''
{{Main|Shuusou Gyoku/Story/Extra Scenario|l1=Shuusou Gyoku: Extra Scenario}}
[[File:Sh01MarisaSprite.png|frame|left|Marisa in ''SSG'']]
Marisa made a guest appearance as the first Extra stage [[boss]] of ''[[Seihou Project]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s first work ''[[Shuusou Gyoku]]'', a [[danmaku]] game series by the doujin circle "[[Shunsatsu sare do?]]", to which [[ZUN]] contributed music. To add to this, [[Yuuka Kazami]] made a guest appearances in the next Seihou game, ''[[Kioh Gyoku]]''.

She seems to have no view towards the [[Seihou World]]; she doesn't know that there's no vegetation and has no thoughts about scientific machinery, but she's aware of what the [[Holy Grail]] is. Curious why [[VIVIT]] and her master [[Erich]] want the grail, she fights her, but is defeated. She was then thudded by [[Reimu Hakurei]] for fighting at the [[Hakurei Shrine]]. Her way of speech indicates that this appearance was between ''[[Mystic Square]]'' and ''[[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]]''.

;''The Grimoire of Marisa'' 
Marisa Kirisame is the author of [[Grimoire of Marisa]], Inspired by [[Aya Shameimaru|a certain tengu's]] [[Shoot_the_Bullet/Translation/Afterword|notebook]]. She wrote down a [[danmaku]] grimoire researching the spell cards of others hoping to acquire hints for new magic or, failing that, at least be able to sell the book to a library for a pretty price. The grimoire itself contains her commentaries of various character's spell cards and some of her own as well as explanations of spell card types and danmaku types.

;''Wild and Horned Hermit'' 
In ''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'', Marisa regularly visits the [[Hakurei Shrine]] to talk about recent happenings, attending whatever festival happens at the time, or simply visiting Reimu. Marisa was the one who originally invited [[Kasen Ibaraki]] to visit the Hakurei Shrine more often, wishing to learn life extending techniques from the hermit, much to Reimu's reluctance.

In chapter 10, Marisa goes to the mountains to search for Hahakigi's Otherworld (actually Kasen's marker tree for her pet eagle, [[Kanda]]) and was caught in the middle of a blizzard. She ends up straying into Kasen's hidden residence by following Kanda on a whim. Despite the near death experience, she later tries to return to Kasen's house but ends up being attacked by Kasen's pet tiger after trying to kill it for its pelt.

In chapter 28, Marisa was found by Kasen in [[Former Hell]] wanting to see the underworld cherries. Kasen gave her a scolding and warned her against going there.

In chapter 34, due to Reimu seemingly having an illness caused by exhaustion (actually due to her pulling all-nighters reading books from [[Suzunaan]]), Marisa took it upon herself to cook rare food, such as [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conium_maculatum hemlock] salad, to help Reimu regain her spirit. The success of her cooking is debatable. Later, after [[Sumireko Usami]] summoned a flying saucer to the shrine, Marisa and Kasen spots an Unidentified Flying Object in the sky.

In chapter 41, prior to the events of ''[[Hidden Star in Four Seasons]]'', it was Marisa who warned Reimu that an incident is happening.

;''Forbidden Scrollery'' 
Marisa is a main character in ''[[Forbidden Scrollery]]''. In the first chapter she was the one who explained about Youma books to Reimu and reporting its appearance in [[Suzunaan]]. Afterwards she is shown frequently visiting Suzunaan and the human village, either for her own needs or to resolve incidents with Reimu or on her own.

She has a winter outfit unique to Forbidden Scrollery, consisting of a black coat over a white frilly skirt.

:{{Main|Symposium of Post-mysticism/Kakashi Spirit News 4|l1=Symposium of Post-mysticism Article: Marisa}}
In ''[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]]'', Marisa acts as the moderator for the symposium that involve [[Kanako Yasaka]], [[Byakuren Hijiri]], and [[Toyosatomimi no Miko]]. She'll usually start off a question to a discussion and will sometimes make her own comments. She also appeared in an article that's dedicated to a fight against [[Cirno]] which happened in ''[[Fairy Wars]]''. This made [[Hatate Himekaidou]] worried of how much stronger [[human]]s have become.

==Relationships==
Marisa has met a major amount of [[characters]] that have appeared within the ''[[Touhou Project]]''.

===Reimu Hakurei===
[[File:GoMIllus-Reimu.jpg|thumb|192px|Reimu and Marisa fighting, as illustrated in ''[[The Grimoire of Marisa]]''.]]
[[File:SSiBArtWallpaper1.jpg|thumb|192px|Reimu and Marisa, in ''[[Silent Sinner in Blue]]''.]] Reimu is Marisa's closest friend, as well as her rival when it comes to youkai extermination and incident resolution. Although it was originally Reimu's job to solely handle incidents, Marisa has taken on many of the responsibilities as well, especially in recent years. There were even a number of times when Reimu and Marisa worked together to resolve incidents. 

When incidents aren't taking place, Marisa can be seen frequently visiting the Hakurei Shrine to hang out with Reimu. Usually for chatting and sometimes staying over for dinner. The Hakurei Shrine is a popular place of activity where festivals and parties are often held, so from time to time Marisa is shown helping Reimu set up for events.

They first met in [[Story of Eastern Wonderland]], and Marisa seemed to immediately take an interest in Reimu. Throughout the rest of the [[PC-98]] era, Marisa often hangs around the [[Hakurei Shrine]], much like she does in the Windows era.

Occasionally, Reimu and Marisa will engage in a duel, such as in Stage 4 of [[Imperishable Night]], or in the fighting games such as [[Antimony of Common Flowers]]. Generally, in her fights with Reimu, Marisa wins about 40% of the time.&lt;ref name="CoLACh19"&gt;''[[Curiosities of Lotus Asia]]'': Chapter 19&lt;/ref&gt; She was initially jealous of how Reimu never does any training and yet remains strong due to her innate connection to the spiritual world as a shrine maiden, but has since developed her own techniques to match Reimu's in danmaku battle. In such regards to Reimu's immense powers, Marisa named and added a time limit to one of Reimu's signature spells, ''Fantasy Nature''&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Grimoire of Marisa]]'': [[The Grimoire of Marisa/Reimu Hakurei's Spell Cards|Reimu Hakurei's Spell Cards]]&lt;/ref&gt;. She is a peace-keeper of Gensokyo alongside Reimu, aside from a few practical jokes now and then.

===Alice Margatroid===
[[Alice Margatroid]] is a fellow magician of the [[Forest of Magic]]. They were partners in ''[[Imperishable Night]]'', and she also supported Marisa in ''[[Subterranean Animism]]''. They first fought during the events of ''[[Mystic Square]]'', and later in ''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]''.

She seems to have a rivalry of sorts with Marisa, with the two often insulting and fighting each other, yet teaming up on several occasions. For all the bickering the two go through, they seem to be close friends, as Alice once recommended Marisa's shop to the [[Three Fairies of Light]] when they needed some [[youkai]] extermination.

===Residents of the [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]]===
The residents of the mansion are fully aware of Marisa sneaking into the magic library. They generally look the other way, but various incidents and win quotes from the fighting games show that they'll fight Marisa in a duel if they actually catch her in the act. At other times, they'll simply leave her be, such as the mansion's private moon viewing party, or Marisa's endings in ''[[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]]'', where Sakuya even plays along with her, either serving her food or helping to conceal her from [[Remilia Scarlet]]. She's on friendly enough terms that she can walk in without any issue from most of the residents, even if she steals things.

;Patchouli Knowledge
[[Patchouli Knowledge]] is one of the victims of Marisa's burglary, often having books from her library stolen. Despite that, she was supporting Marisa in ''[[Subterranean Animism]]'', and they seemed to be on rather good terms. 

;Flandre Scarlet
In ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'', Marisa commented, "sometimes when I sneak into the Scarlet Devil Mansion, I run into the little sister. I had to slip by without drawin' her attention, but after goin' through all that to get into the place, I was hopin' I wouldn't run into her." 

===Rinnosuke Morichika===

}}
[[Rinnosuke Morichika]] worked for Marisa's father at his shop as an apprentice in the Human Village before leaving to start [[Kourindou]] over eleven years ago before Marisa was born, and he's known her since she was small. Judging from [[Curiosities of Lotus Asia]]'s 22nd chapter, she must have known him in person since at least around 2001, and the 6th chapter shows that Marisa once eavesdropped on a conversation between Rinnosuke and her father during one of Rinnosuke's rare visits to the Kirisame residence when she was "very young". Marisa thinks Rinnosuke is stiff with her because of her family, but the truth is Rinnosuke keeps his guard up with her because he doesn't want her to suspect when he's lying to her, particularly when it comes to her paying Rinnosuke with items that she collects. 

Rinnosuke sees Marisa as something of an annoyance, as she often imposes herself on him and takes what she likes from the store. In return, Marisa views Rinnosuke as being clueless and unable to admit that he doesn't understand many of the Outside World objects he identifies as part of his role at [[Kourindou]]. Despite that, they're still on friendly terms. He also created and later gave her the mini-[[hakkero]]. She's also the only one to call him by his nickname "Kourin", signifying either familiarity or Marisa's trademark impolite nature.

Because of Marisa's collecting habits, Rinnosuke is often able to get valuable things she picks up for quite cheap, either because Marisa is unaware of its true value, or she has no need for it. However, he does feel somewhat bad about it.&lt;ref name="cola7"&gt;[[Curiosities of Lotus Asia/Chapter 07|Curiosities of Lotus Asia: Chapter 7]]&lt;/ref&gt;
===Nitori Kawashiro===
[[Nitori Kawashiro]] knows Marisa from the events of ''[[Mountain of Faith]]'', and fancies herself as a friend of Marisa's. She was a support character option in ''[[Subterranean Animism]]''. Nitori herself has a fondness for humans, and Marisa has a respect for technology, and the pair of them get along well enough because of it. Nitori and her fellow [[kappa]] are seen working with Marisa in ''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'', possibly for mutual business purposes.

===Mima===
{{main|Canon}}
In the PC-98 games, Marisa is subservient to [[Mima]]. She admires her greatly, boasting that "Lady Mima cannot be beaten" in ''Story of Eastern Wonderland''&lt;nowiki&gt;'s omake&lt;/nowiki&gt; and apologizing to her when defeated by [[Reimu Hakurei]]. Mima is currently the only character to be addressed honorifically by Marisa. Additionally, she takes some inspiration from Mima, sharing her attack patterns using magical orbs (as well as using them in her ''Orreries Sun'' spell card) and using illusionary wings similar to hers in ''Phantasmagoria of Dim.Dream''. However, they are never shown to engage in conversation with one another on-screen (the closest to it being Mima telling Marisa to "train harder" in ''[[Phantasmagoria of Dim.Dream]]'' and Marisa's cheerfulness when she defeats her). ZUN doesn't answer any questions regarding their relationship, but says that Marisa's attitude towards Mima is easy to understand.&lt;ref&gt;[[ZUN's reply to messages on the former Gensou Bulletin Board 3]]&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Three Fairies of Light===
The [[Three Fairies of Light]] live in the [[Forest of Magic]], and knew about Marisa before they'd formally met. Originally, Marisa considered the three fairies to be normal, unremarkable fairies when Marisa caught them playing pranks on Reimu and herself. However, after the fairies became Marisa's first customers at her shop where she liberated their house from [[Tsuchinoko]], Marisa and the three fairies took a liking to each other, and became friendly acquaintances.

Eventually, Marisa began to join in on their games and sometimes even play pranks on them. The fairies refer to her by her first name, showing familiarity, and are close enough to her that they'll actually cling to her for warmth in the winter. In ''[[Strange and Bright Nature Deity]]'', under the influence of alcohol, Marisa had the three fairies physically hanging off of and clinging to her for protection. Reimu seemed a bit perplexed at this sight, and started referring to them as "those fairies" that Marisa always had hanging around. Marisa and the fairies sometimes team up to play pranks on Reimu as well. In general, the fairies are very friendly towards Marisa, and now see her as their "guardian" of sorts. They are mainly friendly since Marisa doesn't show hostility to them.

Marisa is initially unable to see the fairies' house. To all [[human]]s, fairy homes appear to be normal trees, even if they're actual houses from a fairy's point of view. However, for unexplained reasons, by the time of ''[[Oriental Sacred Place]]'', she's able to detect which tree is their new house simply by looking at it from a distance. Marisa herself seems surprised she can do this, given it's not something "ordinary humans" are typically capable of, even those with a sense of magic. She gives the fairies a cheerful nod and keeps it a secret from Reimu, who was attempting to find their house to evict them.

Marisa also appeared in Sangetsusei's supplementary shooting game ''[[Fairy Wars]]'' as one of the bosses.

===Kirisame Family===
Marisa's family runs a large second-hand shop in the [[Human Village]], called the "Kirisame Shop".&lt;ref name="CoLACh19" /&gt; Marisa has broken off relations with her family, and avoids everything related to them. She says to [[Rinnosuke Morichika]] that she'll never go back to them, and refuses to entertain the idea.&lt;ref name="CoLACh07"&gt;''[[Curiosities of Lotus Asia]]'': Chapter 7&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'', it's stated that her family is a private matter and the details are unclear. The book also hypothesizes that since the Kirisame Shop doesn't handle things related to magic items, it may be one reason why Marisa left. What the Kirisame Shop actually sells and the organisation of the family haven't been made clear. Due to this, her family has been an area of wide speculation. However, [[Marisa's unnamed father|her father]] has been confirmed to visit [[Kourindou]] on rare occasion. None of her family members have been mentioned by name.

===Minor Relationships===
;[[Satori Komeiji]] and [[Koishi Komeiji]]
After the events of ''[[Subterranean Animism]]'' in her scenarios with Nitori Kawashiro and Patchouli Knowledge, Marisa impressed Koishi enough with her strength that she's allowed to come and play at the [[Palace of Earth Spirits]] at any time. She may say she's a friend of Satori to get everyone down there to leave her alone, because all the underground [[youkai]] hate Satori. Although Marisa and Satori tend to put each other at unease at times, Marisa looks forward to being able to go underground whenever she wants to.

;Mimi-chan
In the [[PC-98]] [[canon]], Marisa is [[Mimi-chan]]'s owner, and thinks Mimi's cute. She knows that Mimi-chan's a weapon from [[Yumemi Okazaki]]'s world, but has no idea how to use her, and thus rides on Mimi. If she knew anything about how a intercontinental ballistic missile works, she probably wouldn't be doing so.

;[[Tsuchinoko]]
Marisa took in Tsuchinoko as a pet in ''[[Strange and Bright Nature Deity]]'' chapter 10. She thinks he's too cute to exterminate, and doesn't see why a human couldn't keep [[youkai]] as pets.

;[[Byakuren Hijiri]]
Byakuren is a [[magician]], much like Marisa, although is much more experienced and has become a youkai while Marisa has yet to do so. Despite an initial disagreement and misunderstanding over the status of youkai and humans in the Marisa A ending of ''[[Undefined Fantastic Object]]'', Byakuren liked Marisa's direct personality, and in thanks for Marisa's help in breaking the seal, instructed [[Minamitsu Murasa]] to take Marisa to and from [[Makai]] whenever Marisa wanted. She also told Marisa that, as a magician, she could come see Byakuren if she ever had any trouble. It's unknown if the [[Palanquin Ship]]'s conversion into a temple affected the arrangement.

==Additional Information==
*Marisa's face was shown on most of the [[Windows]] game icons on the &lt;tt&gt;.exe&lt;/tt&gt; files. This excludes the spin-off games, ''[[Double Spoiler]]'', ''[[Fairy Wars]]'', ''[[Impossible Spell Card]]'' and ''[[Violet Detector]]''.
*Marisa is the second most frequent character to appear in the ''[[Touhou Project]]'' games after Reimu, with Marisa not appearing in ''[[Highly Responsive to Prayers]]'' or ''[[Gold Rush]]''. Various exceptions would show to change these statistics such as ''[[Shoot the Bullet]]'', in which both characters didn't appear (but Marisa was used on the .exe's icon), but the two appeared in an afterword story, and ''[[Fairy Wars]]'' had only Marisa, but Reimu was still shown in a cameo.
*Marisa has seven theme songs (excluding remixes), making her the character with the most themes.
*Marisa has appeared on the covers of ''[[Story of Eastern Wonderland]]'', ''[[Phantasmagoria of Dim.Dream]]'', and ''[[Lotus Land Story]]'', as well as on the poster for ''[[Urban Legend in Limbo]]''.
*According to [[Rinnosuke Morichika]], Marisa was inspired to use star-themed magic after a meteor shower viewing party around the year 2001. Marisa's strategy guide in ''Story of Eastern Wonderland''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s omake says her third attack uses star magic, but she only starts to use star magic as her main motif beginning with ''[[Phantasmagoria of Dim.Dream]]''. This would imply that the last 3 PC-98 games don't take place in their release years.
*According to [[Hieda no Akyuu]], Marisa may become a youkai magician like [[Alice Margatroid]] due to the high amount of magic she possesses.&lt;ref name="gumon_117-120" /&gt; In ''Imperishable Night'', she expressed interest in immortality and eternal youth.
*Marisa holds the distinction of being one of the very few characters in any Touhou game who's known to have a living family.
*In ''[[Imperishable Night]]'', Marisa survives looking at the full [[moon]], which should drive normal [[human]]s insane. When Alice asks if she's alright, she says that it's alright since she's insane to begin with. She might well be joking, since [[Reimu Hakurei]] maintains her sanity looking at the full moon too. It could be that humans who are strong-willed enough can overcome that influence.
*In both ''[[Mountain of Faith]]'' and ''[[Subterranean Animism]]'', Marisa lacks her signature bomb move, Master Spark. She regains her Master Spark as a bomb in the following game ''[[Undefined Fantastic Object]]''.
*One of her alternate palettes in ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]'' resembles [[Ellen]] from ''[[Phantasmagoria of Dim.Dream]]''.
*One of her alternate palettes in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'' resembles her PC-98 outfit.
*Marisa was first seen using a wand in ''[[Story of Eastern Wonderland]]'', ''[[Phantasmagoria of Dim.Dream]]'', and ''[[Lotus Land Story]]''. She's not seen with a wand again until ''Undefined Fantastic Object'', which is so far the only [[Windows]] game where she's seen with one.
*Marisa seems knowledgeable about species not native to Japan such as the [[wikipedia:Beaver|beaver]] in Chapter 4 of ''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'' and the [[wikipedia:Rafflesia|rafflesia]] in Chapter 14 of ''[[Oriental Sacred Place]]''.
*When introducing herself or asked who she is, Marisa often blatantly lies that she's the [[shrine maiden]] Reimu Hakurei.
*Marisa's [https://onsen.touhouwiki.net/wiki/File:MarisaTrace.jpg in-game portrait] in [[Phantasmagoria of Dim. Dream]] is traced from the Black Nurse of [[w:Rance (series)|Rance Series]], a game made by AliceSoft.

The unstoppable magician that longs for [[Mima]] and calls her "Mima-sama" (Which part of her is unstoppable, don't ask.) She's quite an ordinary human girl, who can just control some devastating magic. As is the nature of a magician, she's very intelligent, but does ''not'' act cynically nor sets off a Cobalt Bomb while shouting "You insolent [[human]]!!"

This time, she is interested in the magic power flowing out of the Fantastic Ruins.

A magical girl living in the east. She's a girl who's attached to power, confident enough to like showing off her power, and is always looking for someone to fight with and someone to mock.

However, the truth is she's a hard worker and her power is the result of her secret training.

Because of this, she often gets jealous of Reimu who never trains but still exceeds Marisa with her talent alone, and always tries to get in Reimu's way.

Surprisingly, Marisa is very attached to Reimu at the same time, so much that she'd die of boredom without her.

| translation = '''The Strange Magician, Marisa Kirisame'''

A girl who lives in isolation from other people, as is the fate of a magician. &lt;br&gt;
Basically, her wits are sharp, but she generally does not make the best use of them in her daily life. &lt;br&gt;
As a being whom humans are going to forget about, she is not going to interfere with them willingly. She's content doing the things she likes. &lt;br&gt;
Above all else, [[Reimu Hakurei|Reimu]] is her favorite "plaything"&lt;ref&gt;The word used here is 大好物 (daikoubutsu). It literally means "favorite thing", but the word usually refers to a "favorite food" or an actual object. When used in the context of a person, it gives the implication of seeing the other person like an object, like a toy. With the context of her being contrarian and a "bad person" in the おまけ.txt, the meaning likely comes to Marisa seeing Reimu as a "plaything", though still a bit ambiguous.&lt;/ref&gt; (?), so she often goes to hang out with her.

Her weapons are magic. They make everything in life play.

This girl is also one of the protagonists. These two (Marisa and [[Reimu Hakurei|Reimu]]) are the heroines of the [[Touhou]] series.

Marisa has a very contrarian, uncooperative personality, and she really is a pretty bad person. &lt;br&gt;
Although she's [[human]], she remains distant from other humans. It's questionable as to whether she really is human, but she is.

This time she's wearing something resembling an apron, so it's hard to tell if she's a magician or what.

An ordinary girl. The cold weather (or rather, the extra layers of clothing) weakens her abilities somewhat.

Her motivation in life is developing uses for magic that aren't beneficial to society. Also eco-friendly, too.

One of her recent great magic spells summoned a hot spring vein underneath her house to use as a floor-heating device.

She's actually a hard worker, as well as an avid collector.

There are many precious grimoires and other magic items she has collected from all sorts of places all around her house. However, she doesn't use them.

Magic is her weapon. For the time being, her aim is to create a new elixir.

:Both of her [[spell card]] types are certainly not lacking in damage. She's also the character with the highest speed.
:"Magic Napalm" isn't very effective against moving targets.
:Love Sign's "Illusion Laser" continues to hit enemies with its afterimage, so it's easy to continuously damage the enemy, making it quite useful.
:Also, "Master Spark" is a powerful bomb that can deal the highest damage with good stability.

'''Marisa Kirisame'''

Mainly she possesses the ability to use magic.

A bit of an ordinary [[magician]] living in [[Gensokyo]]. She has a mania for collecting things.

It looks like her mania for collecting things is getting more serious after each year.

Her house, which she rarely invites anyone into by the way, is located in the forests of [[Gensokyo]] (a.k.a. [[Forest of Magic]]). It's a bit on the smallish side. The interior is extremely disordered, and would cause an avalanche of collected items if an earthquake hit.

When magic items are gathered in one place they tend to interfere with each other, causing their powers to amplify, weaken, or in some cases even develop completely different powers. Due to this fact, this house may hide items that even Marisa herself never imagined possible.

On another topic, the elixir she had been secretly developing during the winter ended up being too large for consumption. More improvement is required.

'''Marisa Kirisame'''

Species: [[Human]]

Location: The Kirisame household in the [[Forest of Magic]]

Ability: Ability to use magic

An ordinary [[magician]]. She usually cloisters herself in her house located at the [[Forest of Magic]], where there are almost no visitors, and researches magic.

Her personality is unyielding and obstinate, but deep down she is an honest person. She's treated like an annoyance wherever she goes, but in fact she often causes the annoyance to begin with.

One of the reasons she stays in the forest is because no one bothers to go there. She doesn't want to be disturbed while she's doing research, and when she wants to meet others she can always go there herself. She's like a send-only cell phone. However, she causes a disturbance at other places, wherever she goes.

She has good speed and power, but poor melee technique. While her movement is fast, her attacks are slow. She covers for her lack of physical strength with magic, but the amount of enhancement is actually overkill.

A magician.

A [[human]] living in the [[Forest of Magic]]. She can use magic.

She spends her days rummaging through the items and books in her house, trying to develop magic that would be useful for cleaning her disheveled room. Needless to say, she hasn't had any success.

She's a hard worker, as well as a collector.

She hates losing, but she also dislikes those who clearly hates losing. What a troublesome person who hates losing.

Her weapon is magic. When in the dark, she lights up the surroundings with magic.

:''Notes''
:She teams with [[Alice Margatroid|Alice]] in this title.
:Focused speed only applies when she's used as a solo character.
:Her missile's explosion deals a good amount of damage, so it's useful for shooting swarms of enemy familiars down.
:It will kill most enemies instantly.
:Recommended for players who don't care for subtlety.

The [[Forest of Magic]] is the perfect place for her because almost no one bothers to visit her there.

She seems a bit weird, but in reality she's the most straightforward. She always wears black clothing because she thinks that's what magic-users should do and because it hides dirt very well. Very straightforward.

This time she's just following Reimu's lead, but since this doesn't look like a typical incident, she's thinking about what she should do when she gets to the mountain.

She has a surprisingly high amount of faith.

Her fighting style generally relies on equipment that is suitable for people who likes positioning themselves. It becomes very powerful once you master it.

Since she's a magician, she has good affinity with youkai who use magic. Nevertheless, not many people are very fond of her.

里はお祭り騒ぎだ。&lt;br/&gt;
しかし、このお祭りは何処か廃退的で刹那的な 匂いがする。&lt;br/&gt;
心を掴むのが仕事の宗教家達が喜ぶ匂いである。&lt;br/&gt;
彼女は先回りし、宗教家達が甘い汁を吸う前に&lt;br/&gt;
自らの味方を増やす闘いに出た。

特技　三度目の粉飾魔

強射撃や必殺技を使うたびに星が一つずつ点灯していき、 全ての星が点灯すると一度だけ強射撃や必殺技が強化版に変化します。&lt;br/&gt;
威力の増加、範囲の拡大、無敵時間の追加など、&lt;br/&gt;
攻撃ごとに異なる性質が強化されます。&lt;br/&gt;
総じて、全ての星が点灯している魔理沙は危険です。

ラストワード　サングレイザー

乗っている箒で周辺をなぎ払って相手を打ち上げ、&lt;br/&gt;
無防備なところに最大推力で突進打撃を見舞う大技です。&lt;br/&gt;
なぎ払いは攻撃範囲が広く、&lt;br/&gt;

The girl anticipates it, and before the religionists taste the sweet soup,&lt;br/&gt;
she appeared in combat to increase her own allies.

'''Special skill: Three-Tiered Embellishment Magic'''

Each star lights up one by one when using strong ranged attacks or special attacks, and when all the starts are lit up, the next strong ranged attack or special attack will be powered up.&lt;br/&gt;
Depending on the attack, a different aspect of it will be strengthened,&lt;br/&gt;
such as its power increasing, its range enlarging, or granting a period of invincibility.&lt;br/&gt;
Generally speaking, Marisa is dangerous when all the stars are lit up.

'''Last Word: Sun Grazer'''

Riding on her broom, Marisa mows down the vicinity and crushes her opponent,&lt;br/&gt;
and when undefended, performs her strongest skill, a full-force assault.&lt;br/&gt;
The attack range of her sweeping through is wide,&lt;br/&gt;
and you can rely on Marisa to be invincible while attacking.

}}
[[Marisa Kirisame]]'s father is an enigmatic character, only known to be the owner of the Kirisame-ya second-hand shop in the [[Human Village]].  First referenced in ''[[Curiosities of Lotus Asia]]'' chapter 6 in the introduction where Marisa states that Rinnosuke was his former apprentice, he finally "appears" briefly in chapter 20.

==Story==
Rinnosuke briefly visits Marisa's father in ''Curiosities of Lotus Asia'' [[Curiosities of Lotus Asia/Chapter 20|chapter 20]] to learn more about the mysterious miraculous eleven-year cicadas. He hasn't seen him for ten years, but his unease of seeing him again after such a long time quickly goes away as the two discussed various things such as merchandise and the tools of the [[outside world]]. Unfortunately, Marisa's father had no knowledge on the nature of cicadas. After the visit, Rinnosuke commented to Marisa that her father seemed to be doing really well. However, she couldn't hear him over the loud cries of the cicadas.

==Relationships==
===Marisa Kirisame===
[[Marisa Kirisame]] is the only daughter of her parents and used to live with them, but left at an unknown point in time. It is stated in ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'' that it appears she cut off all relations and the reason is a private affair, but Akyu speculates it may have something to do with how the Kirisame shop does not deal in magical goods. In chapter 6 and 7 of Curiosities of Lotus Asia, Marisa says to Rinnosuke that she won't be coming back to them.

===Rinnosuke Morichika===
[[Rinnosuke Morichika]] worked at his store as an apprentice in the [[Human Village]] before leaving to start [[Kourindou]] over eleven years ago. Rinnosuke refers to him as the "human whom I had received hospitality from long time ago", indicating it was Marisa's father that took him in. Rinnosuke used to make rare visits to the Kirisame residence even after that, but hasn't visited for ten years. It is unknown what caused them to lose contact for ten years, and Rinnosuke was a little nervous about seeing him again due to the time that elapsed since then, but from Rinnosuke's meeting with him in ''Curiosities of Lotus Asia'' chapter 20, there doesn't seem to be any bad between them.

===The Hieda Family===
When Marisa thinks of stealing something from [[Hieda no Akyuu]] in chapter 20 of Curiosities of Lotus Asia, Rinnosuke attempts to dissuade her from doing so, as the head of the Kirisame family (presumably Marisa's father) and the Hieda family are on good terms with each other.

{{nihongo|'''Matenshi'''|魔天使}} is a [[humanoid]] of some kind that bares the resemblance of an [[angel]] and is the stage 4 midboss of ''[[Story of Eastern Wonderland]]'' twice. She attacked [[Reimu Hakurei]] and [[Genjii]] after they've flown passed some [[crow]]s and other [[stage enemies]] as they approached her. She's got 5 different types of shots which are: single strand shots right below, random shot spread below, homing shots, some lasers and some 5 way bullets. The official [[Story of Eastern Wonderland/Translation/Other|strategy guide]] states that getting the former 3 is considered lucky. She does this again a while later after she was defeated the first time. With having no dialogue with Reimu, there is nothing known about her.

==Character Design==
===Name===
The name {{nihongo|''Matenshi''|魔天使}} is unofficial and is was taken from the Japanese fanbase, who notably uses the name to refer to this character. The {{nihongo|"Ma"|魔}} can mean "evil", "[[magic]]" or "[[devil]]", while {{nihongo|"tenshi"|天使}} means "[[angel]]", both referencing her appearance. It is not to be confused with [[Tenshi Hinanawi]] which is {{lang|ja|天子}}. It may also be referred to as the {{nihongo|"SoEW 4th Stage Midboss"|封魔録四面中ボス}}.

===Design===
Her sprite shows that she has purple hair at medium length and wears a long blue dress. She has an apron with a cross on it, and also has white wings. Since she's got angel-like wings and a holy attire, she's possibly an [[Angel]]. However, [[Reimaden]] might be in [[Makai]], which can therefore indicate that she's a [[demon]] with the fact that [[Gengetsu]] also has angel wings. Her design somewhat resembles [[Sariel]]'s.

{{nihongo|'''Mayumi Joutouguu'''|杖刀偶 磨弓|Joutouguu Mayumi}} is the stage 5 boss and stage 6 midboss of ''[[Wily Beast and Weakest Creature]]''. She is the head of the Haniwa Army Corps started by [[Keiki Haniyasushin]].

==General Information==

Mayumi appears as the Stage 5 boss and Stage 6 midboss of ''[[Wily Beast and Weakest Creature]]''.

She is [[Keiki]]'s head subordinate and confidant who leads her idol army, protecting the [[Primate Spirit Garden]] from outside enemies such as the rival animal gangs. 

===Personality===

Mayumi is an attentive soldier-type who looks out for the safety of those she's been assigned to protect, such as the human spirits. She has a keen eye around the premises she guards, as evidenced when she quickly noticed the protagonist and deduced the beast spirits plan to use a living human against the haniwa, being quick to alert [[Keiki]] and the soldiers of the invasion of the [[Primate Spirit Garden]] during the events of ''Wily Beast and Weakest Creature''. She seems to be fascinated with shows of strength as she becomes impressed and excited over the protagonist's capability to defeat her.

===Abilities=== 
;Capable of directly turning her loyalty into strength

Mayumi can turn her loyalty into strength, which is evident in her tremendous power. However, even independent of this, she is described as an outstanding swordswoman, archer, and horsewoman, who is extremely capable. &lt;ref name="WBaWCP"&gt; ''[[Wily Beast and Weakest Creature]]'' - Mayumi's Profile &lt;/ref&gt;

==Backstory==
Prior to the events of ''[[Wily Beast and Weakest Creature]]'', the Haniwa Army Corps were able to clear the garden of animal spirits and create a protected home for the human spirits. However, they've replaced the workforce of human spirits entirely since they are very durable as crafted soldiers, lacking the need for rest and unable to get sick. Since the animal spirits lacked a physical body that they could do harm to the hollow soldiers with, the leaders of the gangs were forced to make a counter plan to defeat [[Keiki]]'s haniwa. &lt;ref name="WBaWCP"/&gt; Only after Mayumi and her soldiers were confronted by the animal spirit possessing the protagonist, a living human, was she defeated, allowing the animal spirits to pass through into the garden unprotected. 

==Character Design==
===Origin===
Mayumi is based on funerary objects called [[wikipedia:Haniwa|haniwa]], clay sculptures that were buried with the high-ranking dead in the [[wikipedia:Kofun_period|Kofun era]]. Her pose seems to specifically evoke the [https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bb/Warrior_in_Keiko_Armor%2C_National_Treasure%2C_Kofun_period%2C_6th_century%2C_haniwa_%28terracotta_tomb_figurine%29_from_Iizuka-machi%2C_Ota-shi%2C_Gunma_-_Tokyo_National_Museum_-_DSC06425.JPG haniwa warrior excavated in Ōta], which is among the National Treasures of Japan.

Modern scholars speculate them to have been for the religious purpose of protecting the deceased in the afterlife or maintaining a link between the living and the dead. [[wikisource:en:Nihongi:_Chronicles_of_Japan_from_the_Earliest_Times_to_A.D._697/Book_VI|The Nihon Shoki]] suggests haniwa were developed as a replacement for live sacrifices during the reign of emperor Suinin, who supposedly announced that "from this day forth, in tombs Haniwa must be stood, and no injury committed on any man." This story is considered purely fictional, and there's no proof of human sacrifice ever occurring during Kofun burials&lt;ref&gt;https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/A_Franks-2210&lt;/ref&gt;. The early haniwa were simple cylinders with faces, similar to Mayumi's weapon, but with time more elaborate forms developed, representing houses, boats, animals, warriors, clergy and ordinary citizens. The majority of modern reconstructions of clothing worn in the Kofun period use these later detailed haniwa as a point of reference.

===Name===
Her surname ''Joutouguu'' is likely derived from ''Joutoujin'' ({{lang|ja|杖刀人}}), a term from the [[wikipedia:Inariyama_Sword|Inariyama sword inscription]] assumed to be a title or rank related to military affairs. The ''guu'' ({{lang|ja|偶}}) in her name is the same character in ''[[wikipedia:Dog%C5%AB|doguu]]'' ({{lang|ja|土偶}}), which refers to clay figures sometimes incorrectly associated with haniwas despite different period of origin and purpose, and ''guuzou'' ({{lang|ja|偶像}}), which means "idol".

Her first name, ''Mayumi'', is a real-life given name that means "polished bow" in this case. The first kanji "polish" ({{lang|ja|磨}}) is related to a typical tool in the ancient ages "polished-stone tools" ({{lang|ja|磨製石器}}). On the other hand, "bow" or "arrow" ({{lang|ja|弓}}) is what many haniwa hold in their arms, since they were buried in the tombs of authorities ({{lang|ja|古墳}}) in order to guard them.

The sound of her personal name "Mayumi" is derived from the voice actress {{nihongo|"Mayumi Tanaka"|田中真}}. One of her roles is '"''Hanimaru'''" ({{lang|ja|はに丸}}), the main character of an educational TV program "O~i Hanimaru" ({{lang|ja|お〜いはに丸}}).&lt;ref&gt;''Wily Beast and Weakest Creature'' [[Wily Beast and Weakest Creature/Music|music comments]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Design===
Mayumi has yellow eyes and blonde hair. Her hair is tied into buns held by a white cloth. her sidelocks are shaped like an ancient helmet's cheek pieces. She wears a tiny haniwa on her neck and wields a longer one, it is unknown if the long haniwa is a scabbard for a sword. Her clothes consist of a white shirt and pants under a yellow lamellar armor. Her armguards are purple and are secured with red ropes. Her boots are dark blue.

===Games===
;''Wily Beast and Weakest Creature''

The protagonist meets Mayumi as the boss of Stage 5 after [[Yachie Kicchou]] and before her creator [[Keiki Haniyasushin]]. Mayumi thinks that the protagonist is a human spirit and warns her about the animal spirits. When she realizes that the protagonist is an alive human, she is surprised and asks how she could survive here for so long. Before the protagonist can answer properly, she becomes possessed by the animal spirit and threatens Mayumi. As a result, the animal spirit attacks Mayumi rather than the other way around, partially so that the protagonist can enter the [[Primate Spirit Garden]], but also possibly to take revenge for the one-sided battles with the Haniwa army.

In Marisa Kirisame's ending, Mayumi has a friendly chat with her and tells her about Keiki Haniyasushin.

==Relationships==
;[[Keiki Haniyasushin]]
Keiki is Mayumi's creator and is truly revered by her. Mayumi speaks of her as "Keiki-sama," where the suffix -sama expresses high reverence, for example toward a deity, and praises her craft as well as her ability to give life to her creations.

===Minor relationships===
;[[Yachie Kicchou]]
Mayumi knows Yachie and knows that she controls the Kiketsu. The two are direct opponents.

Mayumi Joutouguu&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Species: Haniwa&lt;br&gt;
Ability: Capable of directly turning her loyalty into strength&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The head of the Haniwa Army Corps made by Keiki.&lt;br&gt;
She's skilled in swordsmanship, archery, and equestrianism, and despite her old-fashioned technology, her pure combat prowess is extremely high.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

It's been predicted that the workforce of human and animal spirits will be gradually replaced by the more efficient haniwa, because they can be immediately repaired after they've been destroyed, they can't get sick, and they don't need any rest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Also, because none of the Animal Realm's residents have physical bodies, they quite literally couldn't lay a finger on any of the haniwa, who had physical forms of their own (even if said forms were just idols).&lt;br&gt;
Since spiritual attacks could only affect spiritual bodies, these attacks had almost no effect on the hollow idols.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

They usually protected the Primate Spirit Garden, but since they promptly eliminated every potential enemy in the Animal Realm, the soldiers became useless dead weight.&lt;br&gt;
That was when a flesh-and-blood human who could destroy the idols arrived.

{{nihongo|'''Medicine Melancholy'''|メディスン・メランコリー|Medisun Merankorī}} is a young [[doll]] [[youkai]] that lives on the [[Hill of the Nameless]] surrounded by poisonous lily-of-the-valley flowers. 

==General Information==
Medicine first appeared in ''[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]'' as a possible opponent. She was then later shown as a target on [[Stage]] 4 of ''[[Shoot the Bullet]]'' and in the background of ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]''. She is a doll who became [[youkai]] after being left in the lily-of-the-valley field on the [[Hill of the Nameless]].

===Personality===
Due to her becoming a youkai only recently and never leaving the Hill of the Nameless, Medicine is very immature and her experience and knowledge are overwhelmingly shallow. Medicine harbors an extreme hatred for humanity, and will actively try to poison anyone near her presence. This combined with her dreadful ability makes Medicine a very frightening youkai who should be avoided at all costs. After being judged by Eiki, Medicine starts to learn how to empathize. Between the events of Phantasmagoria of Flower View and Silent Sinner in Blue, Medicine has learned to be more sociable.

===Abilities===
;Manipulating poison
Medicine is able to manipulate poison, where she can uses the poison on everything; food, attacking and even herself could be covered with poison. It seems to be not merely the poison of lily-of-the-valley, but of all kinds. For example, the poison of wasps, snakes, spiders, alcohol, nicotine, etc. It has the effect such that even touching her will cause inflammation; there's currectly no definite treatment method. Even strong [[youkai]] could be at risk from her poison, and it may cause after effects too. However, since she's in the early childhood of not having lived around the range of several hundred years, she is not able to skilfully control her own power, and does not know how to go easy. Even when the opponent is a [[human]], she puts forth all of her power. Because some of her attacks create clouds of poison in the player's side of the field which slow the player's movements and make dodging difficult, she can be a very troublesome opponent for those that don't take care while near poison. Though supposedly not especially powerful or experienced among youkai, the right poison can affect even very strong people or large numbers of people at once. 

Incidentally, since she is not a living thing, the poison has no effect on her at all. Since all poison are raw materials for drugs, she would have good compatibility with the drug maker [[Eirin Yagokoro]]. The ingredients of seeds that can be taken from plants can cause animals to go insane. She learned that from experience, and she established a way to freely manipulate humans with poison.

===Species===
Since a few hundred years has still not passed from the time she became youkai, she is a novice youkai. Dolls are usually manipulated by humans. Because of this, she wishes for doll emancipation, but there aren't many dolls who agree with her since dolls can't move to begin with. She was a large doll used in [[wikipedia:Ventriloquism|ventriloquism]]. Although she is labeled as a [[youkai]], Medicine's true nature may be that of a [[tsukumogami]], as described in the ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'' article about the [[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Eight Million Gods|Eight Million Gods]].

==Character Design==
[[File:PMiSS_medicine.jpg|thumb|120px|right|Illustration of Medicine in ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'']]
===Origin===
She may have been inspired by [[Wikipedia:Agatha Christie|Agatha Christie]], whose favourite flower was non other than the lily-of-the-valley. This is backed up by ZUN's obvious love for Agatha Christie's stories as seen in other characters like [[Alice Margatroid]], [[Letty Whiterock]], and above all [[Flandre Scarlet]]. Also, she may have been inspired by [[Wikipedia:Nathaniel Hawthorne|Nathaniel Hawthorne]]'s short story, [[Wikipedia:Rappaccini's Daughter|Rappaccini's Daughter]], where the title character, Dr. Rappaccini, keeps his daughter, Beatrice, confined in a garden of poisonous flowers, until she became poisonous herself.

===Name===
Her full name is {{nihongo|''Medicine Melancholy''|メディスン・メランコリー}}, which may have derived from [[Wikipedia:A Medicine for Melancholy|A Medicine For Melancholy]] by [[wikipedia:Ray Bradbury|Ray Bradbury]]. Also, "[[Wiktionary:medicine|medicine]]" can mean a "drug", and a drug can be "poison" – thus, a natural medicine can be poisonous if it were corrupted for harming purposes. "[[Wiktionary:melancholy|Melancholy]]" means to have great sadness or depression, and in archaic terms it means "black bile", or "[[Wikipedia:Melancholia|Melancholia]].

===Design===
Medicine has silver-blue coloured eyes and blonde curly hair. She wears a dark red-purple shirt with red seams, a red skirt with red-purple seams, shoes in the same color and a pink bow at her back. She has a red ribbon in her hair.

She is accompanied by a tiny doll that is similar to her appearance.

[[File:Th09MedicineSprite.png|frame|Medicine's sprite in ''PoFV'']]
:{{Main|Phantasmagoria of Flower View/Story#Medicine's Story|l1=Phantasmagoria of Flower View Story}}
Medicine attacks the player with lily-of-the-valley's poison for no apparent reason other than because they happened to be in her field. Eventually they all get overwhelmed by the poison and leave after the fight. She eventually leaves the field and encounters [[Eiki Shiki, Yamaxanadu]], where she decides she will go against the [[human]]s and the status of dolls rise. Though, Eiki states that she is selfish and should understand the pain of others as well. So she gets judged by Eiki at that moment.

===Spin-offs===
;''Shoot the Bullet''

In ''[[Shoot the Bullet]]'', [[Aya Shameimaru]] encountered Medicine on [[stage]] 4 and took photos of her [[danmaku]].

;''Hopeless Masquerade''
Medicine made a background cameo appearance in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'' on the [[Hall of Dreams' Great Mausoleum]] stage. She is seen sitting high on the mausoleum whilst cheering something.

==Relationships==
;Humanity
She despises all [[human]]s that she encounters. Though, she doesn't actually know how to deal with humans. In [[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]], her human friendship level is listed as "poor" while her danger level is listed as "high".&lt;ref&gt;[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Medicine Melancholy|Perfect Memento in Strict Sense: Medicine Melancholy]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Medicine Melancholy'''

Species: [[Doll]]&lt;br /&gt;
Ability: Manipulating poison

A doll thrown away into a lily-of-the-valley field; over the long years she became a [[youkai]].&lt;br /&gt;
Since a few hundred years has still not passed from the time she became youkai, she is a novice youkai.&lt;br /&gt;
She possesses ability to manipulate poison

Certain kinds of ingredients, taken from a plant, can drive animals mad. She learned that through experience, and established a method of manipulating humans as she pleases.

In addition, as she is not a living being, poison is harmless against her.

Dolls are usually manipulated by [[human]]s. Because of this, she wishes for doll emancipation, but there aren't many dolls who agree with her. To begin with, other dolls don't move on their own...

The suzuran, which weren't expected to bloom, have begun blooming all at once this year. In addition to that, even autumn flowers which weren't supposed to bloom are blooming too. She learned that there are many powers she has never seen in [[Gensokyo]].

{{nihongo|'''Megumu Iizunamaru'''|飯綱丸　龍|Iizunamaru Megumu}} is the Stage 5 [[Boss|boss]] and primary antagonist of ''[[Unconnected Marketeers]]''.

==General Information==

===Personality===
In ''Unconnected Marketeers'', Megumu is initially polite yet cunningly deceitful, willing to set different factions against each other to achieve her goals. She lies through omission to the protagonist and convinces them to battle her former business partner, [[Chimata Tenkyuu]], when Chimata eventually grows powerful enough to not require her assistance. She is singularly concerned with concentrating power into the hands of the [[tengu]], and is obsessed with the pursuit of profit to that end.

===Abilities===
;Capable of manipulating the starry sky
The exact meaning of this is unknown, her powers over the ''starry sky'' are seen in her in-game danmaku patterns in ''Unconnected Marketeers'', as she mostly uses star-shaped bullets.

===Occupation===
Megumu is a great tengu, so she can give orders to [[tengu]] of lower rank, and it's mentioned the great tengu's orders are "absolute." However, she is still not as highly-ranked as [[Tenma]]. According to her in-game profile, she can also give orders to other [[Youkai Mountain|mountain]]-dwelling youkai as well, although some choose to disobey her as they are not so strictly bound to the hierarchy of tengu society. &lt;ref&gt; ''[[Unconnected Marketeers]]'' - Megumu's Profile &lt;/ref&gt;

==Background Information==
===Origin===
Megumu Iizunamaru is based on Iizuna Gongen, a god originated from Mt. Iizuna of Nagano Prefecture. The god is portrayed as a crow tengu and riding a white fox, alluding to [[Tsukasa Kudamaki]]. The god is associated with warfare, which shows Megumu's status as the chief of the crow tengu, and the practice of controlling pipe foxes. The god is also associated with a colony organism of fungus and bacteria called {{nihongo|"Tengu's Barley Rice"|天狗の麦飯}}. The original name for this is {{lang|ja|飯砂}} (cooked rice sand) which is thought to be the origin of the word Iizuna. The name is also used in Megumu's Ability Card, {{nihongo|"Great Tengu's Barley Rice"|大天狗の麦飯}}.

===Name===
Her given name, {{nihongo|''Megumu''|龍}}, is an alternate reading of {{nihongo|''dragon''|龍|''ryū''}}, and is the same ''dragon'' as seen in {{nihongo|''Kouryuudou''|虹龍洞}}, or ''Rainbow Dragon Cave'', the Japanese title of ''Unconnected Marketeers''. It is also likely a pun on {{nihongo|''megumu''|恵む}}, which means "to give money to." Given the name of the ''Rainbow Dragon Cave'', and [[Momoyo Himemushi]]'s stated ability to ''eat dragons'', it's unclear what plot significance this has. 

Her surname, {{nihongo|''Iizunamaru''|飯綱丸}}, is a combination of {{nihongo|''fox spirit''|飯綱|''iizuna''}}, and {{nihongo|''round''|丸|''maru''}}.  {{nihongo|''Maru''|丸}} in particular is typically seen in other names of [[tengu]] characters, such as [[Aya Shameimaru|Aya Shamei''maru'']].

===Design===
Megumu wears a modern dark blue dress with white trim and belts, and a golden [[Wikipedia:pauldron|pauldron]] on her left shoulder with a large blue inset gemstone. She wears a black cape with white fur tufts lining the bottom, a blue [[Wikipedia:Tokin_(headwear)|tokin]], and dark violet [[Wikipedia:Geta_(footwear)|geta]], all typical clothing choices for tengu. She carries a tripod over her right shoulder, which she uses as as a blunt weapon&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mildom.com/10922924|title=東方ステーション　#27　東方虹龍洞特集 |trans-title=Touhou Station #27: Touhou Kouryuudou Edition|people=[[ZUN]]|type=Livestream|date=2021-07-17|website=Mildon|access-date=2021-07-17|language =ja|quote=「あれは鈍器、殴る」「カメラはついてない、三脚だけ」「大天狗は天狗より偉いから、三脚で殴る」}}&lt;/ref&gt;, as well as a test tube similar to the one carried by [[Tsukasa Kudamaki]] strapped to her belt.  She has blue hair and red eyes.

==Story==

===Games===
[[File:Th18MegumuSprite.png|frame|right|Megumu's sprite in ''[[Unconnected Marketeers|UM]]'']]
;''Unconnected Marketeers''

In ''Unconnected Marketeers'', Megumu forms an alliance with [[Chimata Tenkyuu]] for the purposes of distributing Ability Cards. It's described as a somewhat self-serving and one-sided alliance on Megumu's side, where Chimata was in a weakened state and required help to regain her divine power. Megumu had Chimata use her ''marketplace abilities'' to further her own goals, which was to introduce centralized currency into [[Gensokyo]] by backing it on the speculative value of the Ability Cards. Until Megumu's scheme was put into motion, the concept of currency having an ''inherent value'' or being centralized was not something that existed in Gensokyo,&lt;ref&gt;[[Curiosities_of_Lotus_Asia/Chapter_36|Chapter 36]] of [[Curiosities of Lotus Asia]]&lt;/ref&gt; and Megumu saw this as an opportunity to seize power for herself by distorting people's sense of value beyond the inherent value of labour.

At end of the Ability Card Incident in ''Unconnected Marketeers'', she decides to willingly cease distribution of the tengu's currency due to losing her alliance with Chimata, but not without first attempting to manipulate the protagonist into defeating Chimata for her.

==Relationships==
;[[Chimata Tenkyuu]]
In ''Unconnected Marketeers'', Chimata was initially Megumu's business partner for the distribution of Ability Cards, to further the tengu's goal of introducing centralized currency into Gensokyo. They had strong ideological differences with how this new "Ability Card marketplace" ought to be run, with Chimata preferring a more ritualistic and regulated exchange of goods, and Megumu preferring a place with a few rules as possible, &lt;ref&gt; ''[[Unconnected Marketeers]]'' - [[Chimata]]'s Profile &lt;/ref&gt; just so long as the tengu's interests could be served and furthered. 

While Chimata entered into the "business arrangement" under duress and in a severely weakened state, she had always planned to gain enough power so that Megumu could no longer keep her under her thumb. By the end of the Ability Card Incident, their relationship had finally descended into outright hostilities when the protagonist arrived and ordered them to cease operations, when Megumu had realized Chimata had rapidly recovered and become a threat to her plans and when Chimata orders [[Tsukasa]] to tell Iizunamaru that she knew she was being manipulated by her.

;[[Tsukasa Kudamaki]]
Tsukasa is an assistant and advisor to Megumu. However, her loyalty is doubtful, as she pits all sides off against each other for her own benefit. Megumu doesn't seem to be aware of this and is evidently concerned about her; as she forbids her to intervene in the fight with the protagonist, fearing that she might be injured.

;[[Momoyo Himemushi]]
Megumu hired Momoyo to dig up gems in the Rainbow Dragon Cave. Momoyo doesn't seem terribly loyal to Megumu, however, and only mines for the "fun" of it. Ultimately, Momoyo doesn't seem to care if anyone steals gems from the cave so long as she gets a good fight out of it.

===Minor Relationships===
;[[Aya Shameimaru]]
Megumu is the Chief of the Crow Tengu, which makes her Aya's superior. However, nothing is known about their personal relationship.

;[[Hatate Himekaidou]]
Megumu is the Chief of the Crow Tengu, which makes her Hatate's superior. However, nothing is known about their personal relationship.

;[[Tenma]]
Megumu's chief is ''[[Tenma]]''.

Chief of the Crow Tengu&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Megumu Iizunamaru&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Species: Great Tengu&lt;br&gt;
Ability: Capable of manipulating the starry sky&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

One of the Great Tengu who live near the mountain's peak.&lt;br&gt;
Tengu society is vertically-oriented, with Great Tengu corresponding to a mid-ranking boss.&lt;br&gt;
As such, they can give orders to regular tengu as well. The Great Tengu's orders are absolute.&lt;br&gt;
They can give orders to other mountain-dwelling youkai as well... but in that case, some tend to disobey the orders.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

While they have the right to issue orders, they rarely (if ever) give orders for the sake of personal gain.&lt;br&gt;
Great Tengu bear the responsibility of growing and maintaining tengu society.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

She took notice of the dragon gems sleeping within the mountain.&lt;br&gt;
Dragon gems have a very slight soul-capturing effect, even without being refined into magatama.&lt;br&gt;
If she used them to make an entertainment product that people would want to trade, she could probably make a fair profit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

However, if she simply made and sold them, there'd be a limit to both how long and how much she could profit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Therefore, she decided to put the products into wide circulation, and construct a currency system specifically for exchanging them.&lt;br&gt;
Whenever a card merchant made an exchange, the currency system would spread further, and she'd be able to profit off of that.&lt;br&gt;
She knew that this would earn her a far greater turnout than making and selling things directly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

This, however, meant that she needed a reason as to why the cards could only be exchanged via that unique currency system.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

It was then that she took notice of a ''[[Chimata Tenkyuu|marketplace god]]'' who no longer had any place to go, and who seemed like she was about to vanish any moment.&lt;br&gt;
They designed the Ability Cards such that the cards would only be supplied with magic-- thus activating their ability-- when a successful transaction was made with the marketplace god's power. If used in any other way, they'd simply be scraps of paper.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Just as the Great Tengu planned, the Ability Cards began circulating freely, and she made a fine profit indeed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

But that was where a problem arose.&lt;br&gt;
As a result of the cards' active circulation, the marketplace god regained her original power, growing strong enough to threaten tengu society.

{{nihongo|'''Meira'''|明羅}} is a mysterious female [[samurai]] that attacks [[Reimu Hakurei]] on [[stage]] 2 of ''[[Story of Eastern Wonderland]]'', being the [[boss]] of that stage. She'll fire barrage of [[danmaku]] from her sword, where her last attack is shooting some purple and red bullets that reflects five times of the sides of the screen. Believing that by defeating the [[Shrine Maiden]] in battle, she'll gain the powers of Hakurei, she attempts to beat Reimu, but she fails and escapes, where Reimu wanted to bury her. She hasn't been seen since.

==Character Design==
===Name===
Her name is {{nihongo|''Meira''|明羅}}, which can mean "Dark", "Destiny" or "Life". The kanji "{{lang|ja|羅}}" means either "silk", "gauze" or "Latin". "Meira" is actually a common female given name or forename. The kanji can also be pronounced as {{nihongo|Akira|あきら}}, another common female given name or forename.

===Design===
In ''[[Story of Eastern Wonderland]]'''s official art, Meira has dark eyes, purple hair, and wears red and white robes that appears to be male clothing. She also wields a sword. Both her and [[Konngara]] bear a striking resemblance to each other. They also share a single kanji in their names ({{lang|ja|羅}}).

==Additional Information==
*Meira is one of the very few [[characters]] in the ''[[Touhou Project]]'' that was called {{nihongo||さん|-san|lit, "Mr" or "Ms"}} by [[Reimu Hakurei]], a honourific gender-neutral suffix. [[Rinnosuke Morichika]] is another known character who Reimu uses this on. 
*Meira is the first character in the whole series to use multi-colored bullets on the same attack pattern.
**She's also the first to use purple colored bullets.

{{nihongo|'''Merlin Prismriver'''|メルラン・プリズムリバー|Meruran Purizumuribaa}} is a member of the [[Prismriver Sisters]] who performs magnificent music as part of the "Prismriver Ensemble" along with [[Lunasa Prismriver]] and [[Lyrica Prismriver]].

==General Information==
Merlin first made her debut on as the [[stage]] 4 [[boss]] of ''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]'' and appeared as a playable character in ''[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]'', although she didn't have her own scenario. She also made a cameo in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]''.

===Personality===
Merlin overflows with happiness and has a very good rhythm, she was never seen depressed. When she gets interested in something, she gets obsessed with it until becoming almost a maniac &lt;ref&gt; Merlin's article in ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Merlin Prismriver|Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'' &lt;/ref&gt; 

===Abilities===
;Performing on musical instruments without hands or feet
In ''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]'', this is the ability that all three sisters have been specified to have. This probably derives from the ability [[poltergeist]]s have, put to specific use in performing with musical instruments. By manipulating the spirits of instruments, they're able to manipulate the spirits of notes to create sounds. Since they need not have direct contact with the instruments, they are able to play music impossible to play by hand.

Since the three sisters' musical performance is something that they have learned themselves after Layla's death, their previous ability was probably along the lines of "moving things without hands or feet" or "performing notes without hands or feet". The former is because poltergeists in general can move things and made them float. The latter is because in the general phenomena of poltergeists, they can be heard from anywhere, like a rapping noise for example.

;Performing maniac notes
Maniac notes are notes that enhance people's feelings. Upon hearing her performance and receiving too much influence, a listener's feelings become abnormally good so as not to be able to speak, and would induce a feeling of wanting to do a spontaneous dance. Also, since the sound of trumpets resound far away, it may have an effect on the mind and spirit even if heard from afar.

===Species===
Although strictly speaking, [[poltergeist]]s and phantoms seem different, upon some principle in ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'', they have been categorised as phantoms. They're not what has become of living people and animals after death, but rather have an existence created by [[Layla Prismriver]]. Generally, it may be more proper to call them magic beings or spirits. It is known based on their official profiles and from comments by [[Eiki Shiki, Yamaxanadu|Eiki]] that none of the original four sisters are still alive today, though it is unknown how long ago the events were that spawned these three poltergeists occurred.

==Character Design==
[[File:PMiSS merlin.jpg|160px|thumb|Merlin's depiction in ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]''.]]
===Name===
Her full name is {{nihongo|''Merlin Prismriver''|メルラン・プリズムリバー}}. "Merlin" is actually a male name, but there is the variant spelling "Merlyn" from [[Wikipedia:Middle English|Middle English]] (pronounced same) for a female. The name may refer to a wizard from the [[Wiktionary:Arthurian|Arthurian]] legend that involves [[Wikipedia:King Arthur|King Arthur]]. "Merlin" is also the name of the bird [[Wikipedia:Merlin (bird)|falco columbarius]]. There is also [[Wikipedia:Mag Mell|Mag Mell]], a mythical realm in Irish mythology, where it's a pleasurable land of the dead. In the data files for ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'', her name was romanised as "meruran", rather than an actual translation.

Sometimes "Prismriver" is translated as {{nihongo||虹川|niji-kawa}}, which means "rainbow river", even though "rainbow" does not mean "prism". Thus, she and her sisters are sometimes referred to as the {{nihongo|"niji-kawa sisters"|虹川三姉妹}}. The middle dot ({{lang|ja|・}}) in the middle of her name is used in foreign names to show where the next word begins.

===Design===
Merlin wears white clothing, is a trumpeter, and is the second sister. She has blue eyes, wavy light-blue hair, and is always seen with her trumpet floating nearby. Her band uniform is pink, with blue and black trim. Her hat has a blue sun decoration at the peak. Her alternative outfit in ''Phantasmagoria of Flower View'' is same as her normal outfit, except her dress is cyan, and her trumpet is silver. She is a similar height to Lunasa and is taller than Lyrica.

==Appearances==
===Games===
;Perfect Cherry Blossom
[[File:Th07MerlinSprite.png|frame|Merlin's sprite in ''PCB'']]
During the events of ''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]'', the three Prismriver sisters are preparing to play a concert for the flower viewing at [[Hakugyokurou]]. They attempt to stop the player from entering the [[Netherworld]] together, and the progression of the battle is affected by which sister the player decides to focus on attacking during their first [[spell card]]. The dialogue they bounce back and forth between each other and the player is actually quite comical, and shows their very individual personalities. Lunasa is mature and mellow, Merlin is happy-go-lucky and clueless, and Lyrica is a sly smart-alack.

;''Phantasmagoria of Flower View''
[[File:Th09MerlinBackSprite.png|frame|left|Merlin's back sprite in ''PoFV'']]
In ''[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]'', Merlin, with Lunasa, follows Lyrica as she battle various [[characters]]. The two reveal themselves to her as she encounters [[Eiki Shiki, Yamaxanadu]] and Eiki indication that she's not alone. They were following her throughout her scenario because they were interested on what she was doing and to come out when things got dangerous. If [[Eiki Shiki, Yamaxanadu]]'s Extra scenario is completed, then Merlin becomes a selectable character, although she can only appear in Match Mode and has no scenario.
[[File:Th135Merlin.png|frame|Merlin in ''HM'']]

===Spin-offs===
;''Hopeless Masquerade''
Merlin made a background cameo appearance in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'' on the [[Palanquin Ship]] and [[Divine Spirit Mausoleum]] stage. She is seen floating happily with her sisters.
;''Antinomy of Common Flowers''
Merlin made a cameo in ''[[Antinomy of Common Flowers]]'' in the Concert Stage of the Sun. She is seen playing her trumpet with [[Prismriver Sisters|her sisters]] and [[Raiko Horikawa]].

==Relationships==
;[[Prismriver Sisters|Sisters]]
Merlin has two other sisters, [[Lunasa Prismriver]] and [[Lyrica Prismriver]], who all three were created by their fourth sister [[Layla Prismriver]], who is now deceased. They perform music and festivals as a trio. Because these three sisters are created [[Poltergeist]]s who were made by Layla to have the appearance and personalities of her three older sisters from whom she had been separated, they're technically all the same age since they were presumably created at the same time. They only act out the roles of oldest, middle, and youngest sister based on whichever one they were made to resemble.

;[[Raiko Horikawa]]
Raiko is now a member of the Prismriver band, and she performs with the Prismriver sisters at festivals. It's unknown what exact relationship Raiko has with the sisters.

;[[Yuyuko Saigyouji]]
[[Yuyuko Saigyouji]] was their employer during the events of [[Perfect Cherry Blossom]].

==Additional Information==
*Her [[spell card]] background has an image of a score for ''Last Spring'', from ''Two Elegiac Melodies'' by [[Wikipedia:Edvard Grieg|Edvard Grieg]].
*Because these three sisters are created [[poltergeist]]s who were made by Layla Prismriver to have the appearance and personalities of her three older sisters from whom she had been separated, they are technically all the same age since they were presumably created at the same time. They only act out the roles of oldest, middle, and youngest sister based on whichever one they were made to resemble.
*There's a [[glitch]] in ''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]'' where, under very specific conditions, Merlin won't team up with her sisters during the final Spell Card, "Burial Concerto", and instead continues her behaviour from the previous Spell Card. This results in a rather asymmetrical bullet pattern. Additionally, if the final Spell Card is ended with specific timing, Merlin will continue to fire her laser ''during the end dialogue'' and the Clear Bonus tally. Amusingly, it's possible to graze and get hit during this period.
*Merlin, along with the other [[Prismriver Sisters]], [[Mystia Lorelei]] and [[Yuuka Kazami]], are the only frist-[[Windows]]-era-[[spell card]]-capable characters not to appear in ''[[Shoot the Bullet]]''.

{{nihongo|'''Mike Goutokuji'''|豪徳寺 ミケ|Goutokuji Mike}} is the Stage 1 midboss and [[Boss|boss]] in ''[[Unconnected Marketeers]]''.

==General Information==
===Personality===
Mike is shrewd and cunning, immediately attempting to bargain with the protagonist for the cards being circulated in Gensokyo during the events of [[Unconnected Marketeers]]. She continues to push the cards on the protagonist even when she's defeated, apparently considering a successful sale a kind of victory in itself. She speaks in the style of a smooth-talking salesperson, reflecting her design as a maneki-neko (often called a "Lucky Cat"), which are considered good fortune for businesses in Japanese folklore.

===Abilities===
She has the ability to invite money or people to do business. However, due to the fact that she was unable to train as a maneki-neko due to her backstory, her ability developed imperfectly and she can only invite one of the two - and the other will often be driven away. &lt;ref name="UMP"&gt; ''[[Unconnected Marketeers]]'' - Mike's Profile &lt;/ref&gt;

==Backstory==
According to her backstory in [[Unconnected Marketeers]], she initially set out to become a proper maneki-neko of [[wikipedia:Goutoku-ji|Goutoku-ji]], a Buddhist temple in Tokyo. However, she was born as a calico cat, whereas maneki-neko traditionally have pure white fur. She was teased and jeered at by the other maneki-neko trainees ruthlessly, where they even went as far as attempting to bleach her fur white against her wishes. She angrily insisted that there was nothing wrong with being a calico maneki-neko, but was nonetheless cast out from the temple before her training was complete, leaving her unable to perform her duties as a maneki-neko effectively.

Feeling as though she had no place as a maneki-neko in the Outside World, she eventually traveled to the mountains and found her way to Gensokyo, where she's become content with her relatively care-free life in a land accepting of misfit youkai. &lt;ref name="UMP"/&gt;

==Character Design==
&lt;!--===Origin===
--&gt;
===Name===
Her surname, {{nihongo|''Goutokuji''|豪徳寺}}, is taken directly from the real-world Goutoku-ji temple, which is said to be the birthplace of the [[wikipedia:Maneki-neko|maneki-neko]].

Her given name, {{nihongo|''Mike''|ミケ}}, is taken from {{nihongo|''mike-neko''|三毛猫}} (lit. "three-haired cat"), the Japanese word for '[[wikipedia:calico cat|calico cat]]'.

===Design===
Her design is very reminiscent of [[wikipedia:Maneki-neko|maneki-neko]], with the key difference being her [[wikipedia:calico cat|calico]] colouration, present in her hair, fur, and clothing. She wears a collar and wrist bracelets with brass-coloured bells. In her left hand, she holds a [[wikipedia:Koban (coin)|koban coin]], also typical of maneki-neko. In her [[Unconnected Marketeers]] portrait, she also has her right arm in the typical "beckoning" position of a maneki-neko.

==Appearances==
[[File:Th18MikeSprite.png|frame|right|Mike's sprite in ''[[Unconnected Marketeers|UM]]'']]
===Games===
;''Unconnected Marketeers''

She appears as the Stage 1 boss of [[Unconnected Marketeers]], attempting to sell cards to the protagonist. She also informs the protagonist that it's "against the rules" to take the cards by force, and they must be bartered for in some way.

Lucky Charm of Prosperous Business&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

'''Mike Goutokuji'''&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Species: Maneki-neko&lt;br /&gt;
Ability: Capable of beckoning in money or customers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

The maneki-neko of Goutoku-ji temple are ordinarily white cats.&lt;br /&gt;
She, however, was born a calico cat, and it seems that she struggled quite a bit due to her appearance.&lt;br /&gt;
At times, she was shunned as a poor imitation, and at other times, those around her tried to dye her fur.&lt;br /&gt;
But because she spat back at them that there was nothing wrong with being calico, she was ultimately cast out from the group and was unable to partake in her maneki-neko training.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Perhaps because of this, her ability as a maneki-neko developed imperfectly.&lt;br /&gt;
Maneki-neko are meant to beckon money and customers, but in her case, beckoning one of the two will end up driving away the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

By that point, she was worthless to place in a shop. And of course, none were likely to claim her.&lt;br /&gt;
She thought of this as a stroke of good luck, if anything, and abandoned maneki-neko society feeling wholly refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;
And thus, she set out to live a new life in the mountains, comfortable and free of worry.

{{nihongo|'''Mima'''|魅魔}} is a [[vengeful spirit]] that haunts the area around the [[Hakurei Shrine]] in the [[PC-98]] [[canon]]. Though she is called an evil spirit, she is not the same variety as the ones that appear in ''[[Subterranean Animism]]'' and ''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]''. She has an execeptional power and is very confident in her combat and magical abilities. Originally, she is sealed in the ''[[wikipedia:hokora|hokora]]'' attached to the shrine, but manages to repeatedly break free of the seal.

==General Information==
Mima first appeared in the [[Hell]] route of the first ''[[Touhou]]'' game ''[[Highly Responsive to Prayers]]'' as a [[Stage]] 10 Hell Route [[boss]]. She then later appeared as the final boss of ''[[Story of Eastern Wonderland]] and became a playable character in both ''[[Phantasmagoria of Dim.Dream]]'' and ''[[Mystic Square]]''. Although originally a very prominent character in the ''[[Touhou Project]]'' (one of the earliest characters appearing in almost every pre-[[Windows]] game from the very beginning), like many [[PC-98]] characters, Mima has almost entirely disappeared from the series from ''[[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]]'' onwards.

Although she is often called a ghost, Mima denies being dead and tries to explain herself as being "just a soul". In her profiles, she is described as being a "deity-like existence" of the shrine. Though in her Mystic Square good ending, she acknowledges that she is a ghost when alone. Being in spirit form, Mima's magic is most powerful during the night. She claims to want revenge against the entire human race, but it's not known what her motivations for that are. By the present day, most of the evil in her evil spirit has faded off.

Apparently, she is quite knowledgeable about the past of the Hakurei Shrine, even down to knowing exactly what the function of the [[Yin-Yang Orb]]s' true power is. Presumably, there is a reason and a story for this, but she's so old that she's forgotten what it was.

==Character Design==
===Name===
Her only known name is {{nihongo|''Mima''|魅魔}}, which means "charming demon". It's likely to have come from {{nihongo|"deceiving spirit"|魔魅|mami}}, where the kanjis were flipped.

===Design===
[[File:Th01Mima.png|frame|left|Mima's appearance in ''[[The Highly Responsive to Prayers]]''.]] 
Mima's design changes differently throughout the series. The sprite of Mima in ''[[Highly Responsive to Prayers]]'' shows that she has dark eyes, long green hair and a white cap. She wears a long white and blue dress with red and green markings around its edges. She also has a medium-length blue cape with tattered edges, fastened at her neck with a red ribbon. As an [[Vengeful spirit|evil spirit]], she has a light-blue tail rather than legs. Furthermore, she holds a bloody knife in her left hand.

}}
In ''[[Story of Eastern Wonderland]]'', Mima's design changes in three forms. As her first form, her portrait shows that she has green eyes, long green hair, a purple ribbon on her neck and a white cap once again. Her sprite with the same form in her cameo of Stage 5 and at the beginning of the Final Stage shows that she wears a purple dress under a long blue cape and has once again a white tail. The sprite in her second form is same as her first form, except it shows that she wears a blue cap, a blue, light-blue, and green dress with white symbols on it under a long purple cape. She is also shown to have large blue and purple wings and wields a long staff topped with a white crescent. The sprite in her final form in her final attack is same as her second form, except she now has six purple wings. Although her appearance changes in her sprites, her portrait stays the same.

In ''[[Phantasmagoria of Dim.Dream]]'', Mima's design is just as same as ''Story of Eastern Wonderland''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s, except now she has a sun on her blue cap and a long blue cape with a yellow trim and markings over her blue vest and dress. The border of her dress is green. She also has a heavy chain hanging over the left-side of her vest. Furthermore, she once again has a dark-blue tail and it's revealed that she has pointy ears.

In ''[[Mystic Square]]'', Mima's design is just as same as ''Phantasmagoria of Dim.Dream''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s, but her cape now has white trim and markings and is fastened at her neck with a yellow ribbon. Her blue vest has white sleeves and buttons and there is no longer a chain beneath her cape over her chest. Strangely, she appears to have developed legs and now wears white shoes.

Her alternative outfit in ''Phantasmagoria of Dim.Dream'' is same as her normal outfit, except her cape, vest, dress and tail is now green, and that she has blond hair. The border of her dress and her eyes are yellow.

==Appearances==
===PC-98===
;''Highly Responsive to Prayers''
In ''[[Highly Responsive to Prayers]]'', she appears in the midst of a hokora, which is a tiny shrine usually attached to a larger shrine, dedicated to the worship of folk spirits, and battles the player. Afterwards, she's sealed back into the hokora by [[Reimu Hakurei]].

;''Story of Eastern Wonderland''
[[File:Th02mima.png|frame|right|Mima's appearance in ''[[Story of Eastern Wonderland]]''.]]
:{{Main|Story of Eastern Wonderland/Story|l1=Story of Eastern Wonderland Story}}
She breaks loose of this seal in the events of ''[[Story of Eastern Wonderland]]'', and appears in the final two stages along with [[Marisa Kirisame]], who appears to be her apprentice of sorts. Reimu accuses Mima of wrecking her shrine, but Mima responds that she was more interested in vengeance against the entire human race. Mima eventually challenges Reimu so she can take the yin yang orbs and their power for herself. After she suffers another defeat by Reimu's hand, she is once again sealed away, only to break free a month later.

:{{Main|Phantasmagoria of Dim.Dream/Translation/Mima's Scenario|l1=Phantasmagoria of Dim.Dream Story Mima Arc}}
She is one of the playable characters in ''[[Phantasmagoria of Dim.Dream]]''. After defeating Yumemi, her wish is for the moon to stay up forever, as her power is strongest when the moon is out. Yumemi grants her wish by placing the moon in geosynchronous orbit, causing it to always be night. Afterwards, Mima cheerfully used her now-eternal increased power to go tease Reimu some more. Things were eventually restored back to the normal day night circle, but how is a story for another time.

;''Mystic Square''
:{{Main|Mystic Square/Translation/Mima's Scenario|l1=Mystic Square Story Mima Arc}}
She is one of the playable characters in ''[[Mystic Square]]'', deciding to travel to [[Makai]] for her own reasons (that being that the demons were intruding on her turf since the human world was hers). Mima cheerfully trolls her way through the various inhabitants of Makai (including [[Alice Margatroid]]) and eventually meets Shinki. After Shinki introduces herself as the god of Makai, Mima gets an idea to lie that she herself is the god of the human world. She ends up fighting Shinki to stop the demons from going to the human world. After her victory, Shinki asks Mima to leave and questions if Mima is just one of the many [[Yaoyorozu no Kami|eight million gods]]. Mima returns to the Hakurei shrine, thinking on the matter and considers becoming a god, herself, but in the end decides to just tease Reimu some more, even as demons continue to infest the Hakurei Shrine. Later, Mima eventually encounters Alice again, who challenges Mima to a rematch. Aferwards, Mima forces Alice to be her maid. As Alice serves her, Mima decides that maybe she'll become a god, after all.

===After the PC-98===
[[File:AUSv4Mima.png|thumb|frame|right|150px|Mima's appearance on ''[[Akyu's Untouched Score vol.4]]'' cover.]]
{{main|Canon}}
; [[Curiosity of Lotus Asia]]
She was possibly made reference in ''[[Curiosities of Lotus Asia]]'' Chapter 25, when [[Reimu Hakurei]] comments that the [[Hakurei Shrine]] was once taken over by an [[Vengeful spirit#Akuryou|evil spirit]] for its [[god]] (something that Mima, an evil spirit, did). The fact that Mima isn't mentioned by name however, might mean it wasn't Mima.

; [[Akyu's Untouched Score vol.4]] 
After many years of absence, Mima once again appeared on the cover of ''[[Akyu's Untouched Score vol.4]]'', but she appeared to have a star on her cap. 

; [[Dolls in Pseudo Paradise]]
Her music theme "Reincarnation" has been arranged a number of times after the PC-98, with one arrangment coming from ''[[Dolls in Pseudo Paradise]]''. She might've been made reference in the comments of said album. Furthermore, Mima's "Orreries Sun" attack is one of the super moves that [[Marisa Kirisame]] can perform in ''[[Immaterial and Missing Power]]'' and ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]'' as Mima is believed to have been Marisa's mentor of some sort.

==Relationships==
===Marisa Kirisame===
{{main|Canon}}
Within the [[PC-98]], [[Marisa Kirisame]] was subservient to Mima and she tells Marisa to "train harder" in ''[[Phantasmagoria of Dim.Dream]]'' and Marisa saying "I beat Lady Mima". Currently, she's the sole character whom Marisa calls by a title of honour. Marisa admires Mima greatly, boasting that she can make a strategy guide in ''[[Story of Eastern Wonderland]]'''s omake because "there's no way Mima-sama can be beaten", and apologising to Mima when defeated by [[Reimu Hakurei]].

Moreover, in ''Story of Eastern Wonderland'', there was also a bit where Marisa manipulated star magic and sent forth something like "Orreries Sun", and afterwards Mima also used star magic and Orreries. In the [[Windows]] [[canon]], Marisa also has Orreries Sun as a spell card in ''[[Immaterial and Missing Power]]''.

However, in the original work, there wasn't a single scene when Marisa and Mima ever had a mutual conversation together, and the unique talk is only in ''[[Phantasmagoria of Dim. Dream]]'''s winning expressions. In Mima's character settings, there's not a single statement related to Marisa, and in Marisa's character settings, there's nothing except for ''Phantasmagoria of Dim. Dream'' where it said that she "longs for Mima and calls her 'Mima-sama.'" Additionally, [[ZUN]] himself refuses to answer any questions that's associated with this relationship.&lt;ref name="GBB3"&gt;[[ZUN's reply to messages on the former Gensou Bulletin Board 3]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reimu Hakurei===
[[Mima]] haunts the surroundings of the [[Hakurei Shrine]], after many confrontations and being resealed by [[Reimu Hakurei]], she decides to spend her days making fun of the [[Shrine Maiden]].

===Alice Margatroid===
At the end of [[Mystic Square]], Mima takes [[Alice]] as her maid, releasing her some time later.

==Additional Information==
*Mima appears on the covers of ''[[Story of Eastern Wonderland]]'' and ''[[Phantasmagoria of Dim.Dream]]'', the latter among the rest of the playable characters.
*Excluding any spin-offs, Mima is the only Final [[boss]] that takes up the smallest amount of [[stage]]s to get to her, there only being 5, while normally an average ''[[Touhou Project]]'' game has 6 stages.
*She's the only PC-98 character to have appeared on an official CD cover, but has yet to appear in any [[Windows]] game.
*The bloody knife she carries in her original appearance may be a hint at her past, how she became a ghost, or why she became an "evil spirit". It can be easily speculated that Mima either was killed by or committed suicide with the knife she carries.
*In ''[[Highly Responsive to Prayers]]'', she appears to have more than two arms. When she moves to shoot bullets, her left arm stays in place and a third arm appears. This is most likely a [[Glitch|sprite error]] as her third arm shows to also be holding the bloody knife.
*One of her attacks used in ''Story of Eastern Wonderland'' (namely, Orreries Sun), slightly resembles the same &lt;!--http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2qQ8Jxu2sw--&gt; attacks used by the boss Bloody Mary from the RPG ''[[wikipedia:Terranigma|Terranigma]]''. This is most likely a coincidence, however.
*Mima is one of the only two known humanoid [[Vengeful spirit|evil spirits]], with [[Mizuchi Miyadeguchi]] the second one.

{{nihongo|'''Minamitsu Murasa'''|村紗 水蜜|Murasa Minamitsu}} is the spirit of a young drowning victim who afterwards became a notorious threat due to her power to sink ships. She is currently the captain of the [[Palanquin Ship]], searching for the fragments of the Flying Storehouse. She meets the heroine as she is completing the preparations to travel to [[Makai]]. Her unique weapons include the anchors she uses, as well as her ladle, which is apparently bottomless, according to an interview with [[ZUN]] and her [[spell card]] comments in ''[[Double Spoiler]]''.

==General Information==
Minamitsu is a ghost who died long ago in a shipwreck. She first appeared as the Fourth stage boss of ''[[Undefined Fantastic Object]]''. Because she was attached out in the sea, she couldn't cross the [[Sanzu River]], so she stayed in [[Gensokyo]].

===Personality===
While Minamitsu is a rather fearsome [[phantom]], she is still kind-hearted with a bright personality. Mainly due to her ties with the [[Myouren Temple]], she could empathize with [[human]]s and her victims, and thus chooses them more carefully. She also chats with the victims she capsizes.

===Abilities===
;Causing shipwrecks
Minamitsu possesses the ability to cause shipwrecks. Her ability appears to be odd compared to a regular ghost, which is because she drowned at sea a long time ago. Due to a certain attachment to the ocean she kept capsizing passing ships. She can also drown anyone near water, which goes as far as drowning someone who is bathing in hot spring water, or sitting peacefully near a river's edge. This is also why she is seen around places with a lot of water. However, [[Gensokyo]] does not have any seas, so this ability seldom plays a major role.

===Occupation===
She is the [[Palanquin Ship|Palanquin Ship's]] captain, having accepted the job from [[Byakuren Hijiri]] during their first meeting, though she claims there's little for her to actually do in recent days. Currently she is a follower of the [[Myouren Temple]].

===Possessions===
She carries her own ladle, which she uses to flood the ships of her victims with water. In her early ghost years she used to ask for a ladle, though. She also carries an anchor which she uses in battle, but its significance aside from that is unknown.

==Backstory==
After her death, Minamitsu became a spirit, bound to the ocean due to her lingering attachment to the world. Because of her spite, she eventually became renowned far and wide for capsizing ships. Many feared her, and tried to think of ways to somehow restrict her actions, but it wasn't until the monk [[Byakuren Hijiri]] was asked to do something about it that the situation changed. Minamitsu, knowing how famous the monk was at the time, believed she would be able to extend her influence even farther by sinking her, as well, and perhaps even escape her connection to the ocean and attack [[human]]s on land.

However, when Byakuren did appear before her on the seas completely defenseless, Minamitsu sunk her ship easily, prompting the spirit to wonder why. Byakuren then reappeared on the surface atop a shining ship, which she had constructed using the ship Minamitsu had died on as a design. Moved by the monk's insight and her own sense of nostalgia, she accepted Byakuren's offer to captain the shining ship.

Eventually, after Byakuren was sealed away, Minamitsu was "buried" into the ground along with her ship. Having been long forgotten, Minamitsu and the rest of the [[youkai]] were pushed above ground in [[Gensokyo]] by a geyser - likely due to the events in ''[[Subterranean Animism]]'' - along with the palanquin ship and the fragments of the Flying Storehouse.

==Character Design==
[[File:ThGKMurasa.png|thumb|right|220px|Murasa, as illustrated in ''[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]]'']]
===Origin===
She is a {{nihongo|ship [[phantom]]|船幽霊|funa yuurei}}, the ghost of a girl who drowned at sea. These types of ghosts are famous in Japanese folklore for capsizing and sinking ships, which inspired her character background and [[spell card]]s. Her ladle goes with the folklore; the ghost would approach you and demand a ladle, and then you would save yourself by giving them a ladle with a hole in the bottom. 

===Name===
Her full name is {{nihongo|'''Minamitsu Murasa'''|村紗　水蜜|Murasa Minamitsu}} Her given name {{nihongo|"Minamitsu"|水蜜}} is a word that usually refers to the type of peach {{nihongo|''suimitsu tou''|水蜜桃|}} or the peach itself (literally, it means "water honey"). Her surname {{nihongo|"Murasa"|村紗|}} is taken from the type of ship phantom called {{nihongo|''murasa''|ムラサ|}} known in the [[wikipedia:Oki District, Shimane|Oki District]], [[wikipedia:Shimane Prefecture|Shimane]]. Similar to [[Satori Komeiji]] and [[Nue Houjuu]] whose names also taken from their species' name, it's assumed that when she's referred by the name written in kanji, it's referring her by her own name, while using the name in katakata she is referred by her species.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Undefined Fantastic Object]]'' — Captain Murasa's [[Undefined Fantastic Object/Music|music comment]].&lt;/ref&gt; She is more commonly known as "Captain Murasa".

===Design===
Minamitsu has short, black hair and a teal eyecolor. Her clothes are designed after a regular sailor's outfit, with a white shirt and skirt with blue lines. Around her neck she has a neckerchief. In some of her [[spell card]]s, she is seen with a green aura, most likely her ghost form. [[ZUN]] stated in an interview that the design for Minamitsu was the hardest to finish. He had much more sketches of Minamitsu with different hairstyles and haircolor in comparison to the other characters from ''[[Undefined Fantastic Object]]''. He also couldn't decide whether a long or short skirt was better for Minamitsu. Fans got confused whether she wore a skirt or shorts, however, this varies from appearance to appearance.

In [[Touhou Gouyoku Ibun]] she wears shorts with a belt, in addition to that she has a black coat with gold trims and white gloves on her hands, her red tie also has an anchor on it.

==Appearances==
===Games===
;''Undefined Fantastic Object''
[[File:Th12MinamitsuSprite.png|frame|Minamitsu's sprite in ''UFO'']]
In ''[[Undefined Fantastic Object]]'', Minamitsu meets the heroine as she is making preparations for the ship to go to Hokkai via [[Makai]], where [[Byakuren Hijiri]] is being sealed. Along with [[Nazrin]], [[Ichirin Kumoi]], [[Unzan]] and [[Shou Toramaru]], she is one of the youkai trying to unseal her. Unlike Ichirin, she learns that the heroine doesn't have any particular motive to help the group, and attacks in order to take the fragments of the treasure back. Though she loses out in the end, she had already placed the ship in auto-pilot, so it was too late for the heroine to escape.

===Spin-offs===
;''Double Spoiler''
[[File:Th135Murasa.png|frame|Murasa in ''HM'']]
In ''[[Double Spoiler]]'', Murasa appeared as a [[stage]] 5 target, where she uses a few [[spell card]]s and had [[Aya Shameimaru]] and [[Hatate Himekaidou]] take photos of her and her [[danmaku]].

[[File:Th175MinamitsuSprite.gif|thumb|frame|left|100px|Minamitsu's sprite in ''GI'']]
;''Hopeless Masquerade''
Murasa made a background cameo appearance in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'' on the [[Palanquin Ship]] stage. She is seen standing on the ship with an anchor.

;''Gouyoku Ibun''
Minamitsu goes underground to investigate the black water that appeared near the [[Myouren Temple]], and to do so she floods the underground, which annoys [[Kanako Yasaka]] and [[Utsuho Reiuji]], but the goddess leaves her continue after hearing her explanation and Utsuho warns Minamitsu about a "monster that can even gobble up the Blazing Hell's flames in one bite" that she will encounter if she continues. After going all the way down the underground, she enters the [[Hell of Blood Pools]], where she encounters [[Yuuma Toutetsu]]. After explaining that she already knew the petroleum was blood, Yuuma attacks the captain, but is defeated.

==Relationships==
;[[Byakuren Hijiri]]
Minamitsu has a very strong relationship with Byakuren, as she is pretty much the youkai captain's savior. After reappearing in [[Gensokyo]], she swore to return favor and rescue Byakuren. 

;[[Shou Toramaru]], [[Ichirin Kumoi]] &amp; [[Nazrin]]
She is a colleague of both [[Shou Toramaru|Shou]] and [[Ichirin Kumoi|Ichirin]], though it's unknown exactly how or when they met.

==Additional Information==
*Her stage theme has a distinctive [[wikipedia:Windows XP|Windows XP]] balloon hint "pop" around 2:10, which probably got in the recording, as stated in [http://twitter.com/korindo/status/2471172052 ZUN's Twitter].
*Like [[Aya Shameimaru]] in ''[[Mountain of Faith]]'', Minamitsu Murasa doesn't seem to have a gimmick/variation based on the playable character (which is something usual in stage 4 bosses). Though, both have a timeout [[spell card]] on Normal, Hard and Lunatic.

　　村紗 水蜜（むらさ みなみつ）&lt;br /&gt;

　　種族：舟幽霊&lt;br /&gt;
　　能力：水難事故を引き起こす程度の能力


　　遥か昔、海で舟が転覆して亡くなった人間の霊。&lt;br /&gt;
　　未練から海を離れることが出来ず、そこに通りかかった舟を転覆させる毎日を送っていた。

　　彼女は人間から恐れられた。&lt;br /&gt;
　　人間の恐怖の念が彼女を妖怪に変え、ますます自分の自由な行動が制限されるようになった。&lt;br /&gt;
　　その妖怪は、彼女の名前からムラサと呼ばれた。

　　そんなある日、彼女に転機が訪れる。&lt;br /&gt;
　　彼女の元にムラサを退治して欲しい、と依頼された一人の僧侶がやってきたのだ。

　　彼女にとっても願ったり叶ったりであった。&lt;br /&gt;
　　もうただの人間を乗せた舟を沈めても、妖怪としての力（恐怖）は上がらないと思っていたからだ。&lt;br /&gt;
　　その僧侶、聞けば大層名のある僧侶だと言う。そんな僧侶を乗せた舟を沈めれば、当然妖怪としての格が上がるだろう。&lt;br /&gt;
　　それが成功すれば、私を縛る呪われた海から離れて人間を襲う事も出来るかも知れない。&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

　　――数日後、彼女を退治しにやってきた僧侶を乗せた舟が近づいた。&lt;br /&gt;
　　舟には僧侶の他にも数人の人間が乗っていた。&lt;br /&gt;
　　彼女はありったけの力で、脅してやろうと思った。&lt;br /&gt;
　　ありったけの力で、僧侶の法力を破ってやろうと思った。

　　しかし彼女の予想が外れ、僧侶は完全に無防備であった。&lt;br /&gt;
　　ただの人間より手応えが無かったのだ。&lt;br /&gt;
　　あっという間に舟は沈み、数名の人間は全て海に投げ出された。

　　彼女は落胆した。&lt;br /&gt;
　　こんな手応えの無い相手を倒したって何の自慢にもならない。&lt;br /&gt;
　　そう思っていた彼女の眼に信じられない光景が映った。

　　僧侶は海の上に居た。&lt;br /&gt;
　　さっき転覆させた舟とは異なる、光り輝く舟に乗っていたのだ。&lt;br /&gt;
　　しかもその舟は、遥か昔私が乗っていた物であった。

　　「貴方はこの舟を探していたのでしょう？&lt;br /&gt;
　　　だから違う舟は全て転覆させてきた」

　　僧侶は自分の法力で光の舟を創りだしていたのだ。

　　「その舟は……！&lt;br /&gt;
　　　ああ懐かしい……なんで」&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

　　妖怪となった彼女には、剣や矢よりも精神的な攻撃の方が怖かった。&lt;br /&gt;
　　僧侶はその事を知っていた。

　　「私達を乗せてきた舟は、不慮の水難事故で沈んでしまいました。&lt;br /&gt;
　　　私の法力で新しい舟を創りましたが、これは特殊な舟で操れる者が居ません」

　　僧侶は、水から離れられない私に手をさしのべた。

　　「この舟を操るのは貴方です」

　　その言葉で、彼女は呪われた海を捨てる事が出来た。&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

　　それから数十年後。&lt;br /&gt;
　　妖怪を救う白蓮が、人間達に捕らわれ封印されてしまった。&lt;br /&gt;
　　それと同時に、白蓮に関わる物品も、地底奥深くに埋められてしまった。&lt;br /&gt;
　　村紗もまた、飛倉と共に埋められてしまったのである。

　　まさか間欠泉と共に再び地上に現れる事になるとは、彼女自身も予想していなかった。&lt;br /&gt;
　　そして誓う。&lt;br /&gt;
　　今度は私が白蓮を救う番だ、と。そう、白蓮が生み出した舟に乗って。
| translation=○Stage 4 Boss　　The Ghost of the Shipwreck Accident&lt;br /&gt;

Minamitsu Murasa

Species: Ship phantom&lt;br /&gt;
Ability: Causing shipwrecks&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

The spirit of a human who fell off a ship and drowned in the distant past; due to her lingering attachment to this world, she was bound to the ocean and spent her days capsizing passing ships.

Humans feared her.&lt;br /&gt;
Their fears turned her into a youkai, and over time, her ability to act freely was getting more and more restricted.&lt;br /&gt;
People called her Murasa, based on her original name.

And so one day she reached a turning point.&lt;br /&gt;
A Buddhist priest who'd been asked to vanquish Murasa appeared.

It was everything she'd wished for, too.
She didn't think she could expand her power of fear as a youkai just by sinking ships with normal humans on them anymore.
The monk that appeared was apparently very well known.  Her status as a youkai would surely rise if she could sink the ship the monk was on.
"If I succeed," she thought, "Maybe I can even free myself from this cursed ocean and attack the humans."&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

―― A few days later, the ship bearing the monk who'd come to defeat her approached.&lt;br /&gt;
There were a few other humans besides the monk on that ship.&lt;br /&gt;
She thought she'd use all her strength to threaten them.&lt;br /&gt;
She thought she'd use all her strength to destroy the monk's Buddhist powers.

But, contrary to her expectations, the monk was completely defenseless.&lt;br /&gt;
She got no response from her beyond that of a normal human.&lt;br /&gt;
Before she knew it, the ship was sunk, and all of the people on it were flung into the sea.

This discouraged her.&lt;br /&gt;
There was no pride to be taken in defeating someone so powerless.&lt;br /&gt;
As she thought that, an unbelievable spectacle unfolded before her.

The monk was floating above the ocean.&lt;br /&gt;
"She's riding a shining boat—and it's not the one I just capsized.&lt;br /&gt;
In fact, that's the ship that I rode in so long ago."

"You were looking for this ship, right?&lt;br /&gt;
That's why you sunk all of those other ships."

The monk had made the shining ship using her own powers.

"That ship ... ... !&lt;br /&gt;
Ah, how nostalgic ... ... but why?"&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

A youkai like her was much more afraid of spiritual attacks than swords or arrows.&lt;br /&gt;
The monk knew this well.

"The ship that brought us here was sunk in a shipwreck.&lt;br /&gt;
I've used my powers to make a new ship, but this is a very special ship, so there's no one that can captain it."

The monk extended her hand out to me, into the oceans to which I was bound.

"But you can captain this ship."

And with those words, she was able to leave these cursed oceans behind.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

A few decades passed.&lt;br /&gt;
Byakuren, the youkai saviour, had been captured and sealed by humans.&lt;br /&gt;
At the same time, anything related to Byakuren was buried deep beneath the earth.&lt;br /&gt;
Murasa, too, had been buried deep beneath the earth with the Flying Storehouse.

She never imagined she would be sent flying back above ground by a geyser.&lt;br /&gt;
And so she swears an oath:&lt;br /&gt;
"Now it's my turn to rescue Byakuren. Yes, aboard the ship that she created!"

{{nihongo|'''Multi'''|マルチ|Maruchi}} is a [[robot]] from the ''[[wikipedia:To Heart|To Heart]]'' [[wikipedia:Visual novel|visual novel]] series. She isn't a ''[[Touhou Project]]'' character as she makes an unofficial cameo appearance in Reimu's good ending in ''[[Phantasmagoria of Dim.Dream]]'' as a single throwaway joke. Her name was censored to {{nihongo||ま○ち|Ma○chi|written in hiragana when officially it's in katakana}} in-game and her eyes are censored with a black rectangular box because [[ZUN]] either couldn't or didn't get [[wikipedia:Leaf (Japanese company)|Leaf]]'s permission to put her in the game.

Similar to her official appearances, she has short green hair and wears a typical pink and white Japanese school uniform with short green hair. Her large robotic "ears" enable her to be distinguished as a robot. In her official appearances, she has emerald green eyes.

===Additional Information===
*Multi is the only known character that [[ZUN]] made a drawing of that wasn't created entirely by him.
*[[Ruukoto]]'s character design is thought to be a parody of Multi's since Multi is also not very good at cleaning.
*Multi is one of the few characters in the entire series to have appeared in a game without ever having been a playable character or a boss character.
*The hand seen when she's presented appears to be [[wikipedia:Doraemon|Doraemon]]'s hand. The way the hand presents Multi to Reimu is also the same way Doraemon takes out or presents new gadgets to someone.

This [[bake-danuki]] appears on Chapter 11 on the ''[[Oriental Sacred Place]]'' where she masquerades as [[Marisa Kirisame]] and joins [[Reimu Hakurei]] for a moon-viewing, presumably to gain access to the [[shrine maiden]]'s mochi and sake. Reimu is aware of the fact that she's not actually Marisa for quite some time, but still allows her to stay for a while. When Reimu reveals that she knows who she is, the bake-danuki, impressed by the shrine-maiden's insight, thanks her for the food and drink and disappears. She hasn't been seen since.

In ''[[Forbidden Scrollery]]'', this youkai fox transformed into a human child to be able to follow [[Keine Kamishirasawa]]'s lessons and to learn writing in human language. However, because it lacked any paper material to write on, it wrote on the schools door, alarming the villagers as there was a youkai hidden among children. Even after Reimu starts a surveillance at the school, it manages to avoid the shrine maiden's traps and is unaffected by her youkai-repelling [[ofuda]], as it lacks any kind of evil. At the end, it is helped by [[Kosuzu Motoori]], that communicates with it and gives it a notebook to write on, making Reimu and the villagers believe that it left the school.

}}
A snake from the [[Outside World]] that ate a human, causing it to be transported to [[Gensokyo]] as a youkai. Using its newfound powers, the snake became an infamous dine-and-dasher in the [[Human Village]], wearing a different human disguise each time and seemingly vanishing into thin air if chased. At the same time, it caused unrest by attacking a number of humans in its true form. Eventually the snake was confronted by [[Mamizou Futatsuiwa]], who broke its disguise and taught it Gensokyo's rules about interfering with human villagers.

===Ability===
[[File:Snake_youkai_disguises.png|thumb|290px|The various disguises used by the snake in ''[[Forbidden Scrollery]]'']]
The snake youkai is capable of disguising itself as a human and can take many different forms. However, according to Mamizou its disguises are "low-ranking" and easily seen through. Exposure to tobacco smoke disrupts the snake's powers and forces it to revert to its true form.

| occupation = Fortune-teller (formerly)
| location = [[Human Village]] (formerly)
| appPrintworks = *''[[Forbidden Scrollery]]'' (Chapters 24-25, 33 cameo)
}}
A fortune-teller from the [[Human Village]], who was shunned by the village's master diviner for incorporating [[magic]] into his techniques. After peering into "the outer edge of our world", he came to resent how [[Gensokyo]]'s humans lived at the mercy of [[youkai]], and created a plan to become a youkai himself.

Around half a year before the events of ''[[Forbidden Scrollery]]'' chapter 24, the fortune-teller committed suicide, leaving behind a book in which he had written a mix of powerful divination techniques and childish scribbles. When Kosuzu began taking the book's techniques for her own while discarding the gibberish, it created a grudge that linked the book with the fortune-teller's spirit; by carefully controlling his emotions he was then able to cross over into the mortal world without becoming a [[vengeful spirit]].

The fortune-teller, reborn as a [[jinyou]], is discovered by [[Reimu]] who pursues him into the wilderness away from the village. Once no one is around, he claims that he has no intention of harming humans or even living anywhere they could find him, so there is no need for he and the "youkai shrine maiden" to fight. In response Reimu tells the jinyou that he has been misinformed, and that a human villager becoming a youkai is "the greatest sin of all", before apparently killing him.

===Character Design===
; Design
While still alive the fortune-teller had the appearance of a normal human, with a long nose and black hair swept back into a short ponytail. He is sometimes seen wearing glasses and a coat or cloak.

After becoming a jinyou he takes on a demonic appearance with pointed ears, claws and fangs, similar to the "Nosferatu" depiction of vampires. The inside of his body has apparently transformed into darkness while his skin is now tough and leathery, with his eyes and mouth having become gashes that open into it. He no longer wears glasses, and his cloak collar flares upwards.

;[[Reimu Hakurei]] (Exterminator)
The fortune-teller was aware of Reimu's reputation as the "youkai shrine maiden", knowing that she allowed youkai to visit her shrine without exterminating them, and believed that she would take his side. However, things turned out to be different, and Reimu exterminated him without hesitation.

{{nihongo|'''Sokrates'''|ソクラテス|Sokuratesu}} is [[Ellen]]'s average short-haired pet [[cat]] with light tan fur from the [[PC-98]] era.

Sokrates seems to share his name with a classic Greek philosopher called [[wikipedia:Socrates|Socrates]]. [[ZUN]] notes that [[Ellen]]'s clothing style and the "age" where cats were pets don't really match up, so the cat should probably be named "Archimedes" instead.

The {{nihongo|'''Giant Toad'''|大蝦蟇|Dai Gama}} is a [[toad]] that lives in the [[Giant Toad's Pond]] who first appeared in [[Cirno]]'s article ''[[Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red]]''. In the article, it was said that Cirno was freezing frogs as usual, so this toad decided to punish her by eating her. However, Cirno escapes by freezing the toad's stomach, making it spit her out. Neither had any major injuries.

Considering the divine nature of the pond, it is likely that the toad acts as its guardian. Unless provoked, the Giant Toad will remain benevolent and gentle. Providing it with an offering will ensure that [[human]]s who visit the pond will have a safe trip home. On the walk home, a seemingly ordinary toad will follow you down to the base of the [[Youkai Mountain]]. This toad is actually a subordinate of the Giant Toad, and is a sign of its approval. No [[youkai]] would dare to attack a human being followed by the Giant Toads's watchful eyes. The toad is the size of two humans

The {{nihongo|'''Tsuchinoko'''|槌の子}} is a brown look-alike snake creature that is owned as a pet by [[Marisa Kirisame]], where the body between of head and the tail is "fat". In ''[[Strange and Bright Nature Deity]]'' chapter 9, the [[Three Fairies of Light]] found their home covered with vines. They were unable to get into their home, so they got Marisa to help. In chapter 10, they believed it was a "Vine [[Youkai]]". When Luna Child created some food for the group, the "Vine Youkai" quickly ate the food, and they realised it was actually a Tsuchinoko and Marisa decided to take it home as a pet.

[[Reimu Hakurei]] recommended Marisa to exterminate it, but she refused. To add to this, because it sleeps a lot, eats a lot, snores, and with the lack of food supply Marisa has for it, it's unknown if she did exterminate it or if she still owns it as a pet. Its [[god]] is the Nozuchi.

Kume is a giant eagle that [[Kasen Ibaraki]] controls and it was referred to as a [[cryptid]] (generally a mythological creature rejected by science) in Kasen's profile, appearing in ''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'' chapters 5, 6 and 9. Kasen uses it as a form of transportation and later presumably under Kasen's orders, drops [[Reimu Hakurei]] off back to the [[Hakurei Shrine]]. The [[dapeng]] is later seen in chapter 9, flying Kasen away from [[Suika Ibuki]]. It looks like a [[Wikipedia:Bald Eagle|Bald Eagle]] about 5 to 7 meters long, large enough to sustain Kasen and Reimu's weight with ease.

{{nihongo|'''Mukou'''|務光}} is a [[raijuu]], a poisonous electricity-producing beast that first appeared in ''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'' Chapter 6. During an unseasonal thunderstorm, Reimu and Marisa discover it, believing it to be an electric animal that could be raised to provide electricity. Its poison, however, affects the two [[human]]s to feel demotivated. The raijuu turns out to be one of [[Kasen]]'s many pets, and had caused the thunderstorm because it had been feeling neglected. The cure for the raijuu's poison is revealed to be corn, which helps Reimu and Marisa recover very quickly.

On its first appearance Mukou was not referred to by name. Its current name was revealed as part of Kasen's appearance in ''[[Urban Legend in Limbo]]''.

===Character Design===

In its name {{nihongo|''Mukou''|務光}}, the first kanji means "duties" whilst the second means "light". It is a ferret-like animal with white fur and red eyes. A mane of darker blue fur stretches from its forehead to the tip of its tail.

===Additional Information===
*Kasen reminisces about how she caught Mukou during a thunderstorm at the shrine, which resulted in a tree behind the shrine being struck by lightning. This tree appears in ''[[Strange and Bright Nature Deity]]'' Chapter 21 onwards, where it becomes the new home of the [[Three Fairies of Light]].

After [[Marisa Kirisame]] discovers the hidden location of Kasen's dojo on [[Youkai Mountain]] in chapter 10, Kasen acquires Houso to guard the dojo from suspicious intruders. When Marisa tries to find her house again to rob it, Houso confronts and attacks her, resulting in an injury to her arm that was healed by [[Unshou]]. However, because Kasen trained Houso not to attack without provocation, it's revealed that Marisa tried to take its hide because she figured it would be valuable.

{{nihongo|'''Manzairaku'''|万歳楽}} is a seal, found in the [[Genbu Ravine]] by the [[kappa]] and [[Marisa Kirisame]] after she left a party at the [[Hakurei Shrine]]. Initially mistaken for a fur-covered monster fish, with a head like an otter's, the kappa let it go due to its appearance and large size. However, after [[Kasen Ibaraki]] describes the seal-like folkloric Manzairaku, purported to bring good fortune, Marisa and [[Reimu Hakurei]] go back to see the "fish." After using sonar and searchlights to find it once again, crowds later gather to catch a glimpse.

Perturbed by the gathering crowds at their home, [[Nitori Kawashiro]] and the other kappa move Manzairaku to the [[Abandon Pond]], where they use it to entertain visitors. It enjoys performing, but becomes depressed. Nitori asks Kasen to help, but still under the assumption the seal is a "strange fish", Nitori explains it might actually be a sea mammal. Kasen explains that it needs saltwater, so Nitori builds an artificial pool. It also tells Kasen its story. 

In the [[Outside World]], it swam up a river in a city, where it drew the attention of humans. It was made an honorary citizen, but after it left for the sea and came back, it was forgotten by them, making it lonely, and it wound up in Gensokyo.

In ''[[Urban Legend in Limbo]]'' it assists Kasen in her attacks.

===Character Design===
;Origin
Manzairaku seems to be based on Tama-chan, who became renowned in Japan in 2002 when it lived in the Tama River in Tokyo. Seals are not native to Japan, which is why it was a rare sight. Like Manzairaku in the Outside World, interest in Tama-chan also faded.

;Design
Manzairaku looks like a typical seal and is grey in color.

===Relationships===
;[[Kasen Ibaraki]]
Manzairaku seems to trust Kasen, being willing to talk to her, and even assisting her in ''[[Urban Legend in Limbo]]''.

;[[Kappa]]
Though initially being frightened of it, the kappa eventually teach Manzairaku tricks and has it put on shows to entertain folks for money. Manzairaku doesn't seem to dislike its position. However, despite treating him well, the kappa were ignorant in how to care for it, by having it live in freshwater and even being hinted to feed it "kappa food" (shirikodama), depressing him briefly.

;[[Human]]s
Manzairaku seems to love humans and the attention it gets from them, even becoming lonely when it's not the center of their attention.

{{nihongo|'''Tenryuu'''|天龍||lit. "Heavenly Dragon"}} is a dragon that supposedly lives in the sky. It was first mentioned in Chapter 22 of [[Curiosities of Lotus Asia]] when [[Rinnosuke Morichika]] was examining the youkai armillary sphere made by [[Yukari Yakumo]], then later referenced in ''[[Double Spoiler]]'' by [[Aya Shameimaru]] when talking about [[Utsuho Reiuji]]'s ''Seven Stars "Septentrion"'' [[spell card]], and finally shown in the kappa's planetarium in ''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]''. Although it's called the "King of Constellations" and is identified with the Big Dipper, unlike other constellations Tenryuu is considered to be an actual living dragon that soars through the heavens. This dragon is allegedly on its way to devour the North Star, and it is said that when that happens something that makes both Heaven and Earth to tremble will occur. According to [[Kasen Ibaraki]], "dragons will become rulers of everything under Heaven as the Heaven-born dragon dances through the sky". 

In Curiosities of Lotus Asia, Rinnosuke gives a similar but somewhat more complex version of the event, saying that Polaris (also called the North Star or Unmoving Star) is the face of the Lord of the Night Acala, an embodiment of Mahavairocana. Mahavairocana is an avatar of the Sun that consumes the power of youkai, and that turns into Acala during nighttime to prevent youkai from rampaging. The dragon is plotting to eat Acala to control the sky day and night. According to the records, it is prophesied that Tenryuu will move after a few thousand years, and then youkai society will also undergo a great metamorphosis. Moreover, shooting stars are said to be Tenryuu's scales that fall off.

{{nihongo|'''Suiki'''|水鬼}} is one the [[kishin]] chiefs from Hell. In Chapter 12 of ''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'' this figure came to Gensokyo to hunt and kill [[Seiga Kaku]], as the hermit had extended her lifespan too much, going against the concept of [[wikipedia:Saṃsāra|Saṃsāra]], the cycle of life, death, and rebirth. Suiki's actions also caused problems for the [[kappa]], making it impossible for them to approach [[Genbu Ravine]], their home.

===Abilities===
Suiki has shown the ability to manipulate water to a great extent. By concentrating a vast amount of water from all of Gensokyo in the same place and super-pressurizing it, they created a huge, layered, extremely powerful column capable of instantly disintegrating rocks on contact, and mantained it for various consecutive days. According to [[Nitori Kawashiro]], this power is comparable to that of Lord [[Suiryuu]], the water [[dragon]].

===Character Design===
; Name
This character's name is {{nihongo|''Suiki''|水鬼|lit. "Water Oni"}}, same as that of one of the four demons serving the sorcerer [http://iganinja.jp/en/place/spot/post-35.html Fujiwara no Chikata].

{{nihongo|'''Minoriko Aki'''|秋 穣子|Aki Minoriko}} is the [[god]]dess of abundant harvest in [[Gensokyo]]. Along with [[Shizuha Aki|Shizuha]], her older sister, they control the [[Wikipedia:autumn|autumn]] season. She visits the [[Human Village]] to give humans a good harvest, and she also runs a sweet potato stand.
{{TOC limit|3}}

==General Information==
Her first appearance was in ''[[Mountain of Faith]]'' as a stage 1 boss. Minoriko is one of the [[Yaoyorozu no Kami|myriad gods]]. She appears during the autumn season in various places in Gensokyo to bless or curse the humans' crops.

===Personality===
Minoriko is simplistic and cheerful. For a goddess, she isn't very dignified, however. She also has a superiority complex with regards to Shizuha, and together they become depressed when winter comes. In her dialogue with Reimu she said that gods put lots of time into themselves. That is why she wears freshly-harvested sweet potato smelling perfume.

===Occupation===
Minoriko is a harvest goddess. However, it appears that she's lesser-known, as there are many other, more famous harvest gods. Because of this, she's considered a "wild" or "feral" goddess who has great difficulty acquiring any faith at all. It is for this reason that she is nearly indistinguishable from a regular youkai. Compared to her sister, Shizuha, she is having more difficult time, since harvest gods and goddesses are particularly plentiful. However, she appreciates the smaller workload, and despite not having many shrines dedicated to her, she still gets enough faith from individual people. She regularly attends the humans' yearly harvest festival to bless their crops.

===Abilities===
;Controlling abundant harvest 
Her ability is to control the autumn harvest. Thus, she can either bring about a plentiful harvest or destroy crops altogether. Apparently she works hard to cultivate the crops one at a time, and this power is limited to just plants that bear in the autumn. She's called to the [[Human Village]] as a special guest at the harvest festival every year. If she is not called for before the harvest, she is not able to guarantee an abundant harvest, but that's not her problem, and she would not point it out.

From the view of the residents of [[Gensokyo]], the ability to make crops have an abundant harvest is a god-like power, and at looking at how she is called to the harvest festival every year, it can be considered that among gods, she considerably close and intimate to humans.

==Character Design==
[[File:ThGKAki.png|thumb|200px|Minoriko as depicted in ''[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]]'']]
===Name===
{{nihongo|''Minoriko Aki''|秋 穣子}} is her name. The character for {{nihongo||秋|Aki}} means "Autumn" or "Fall". {{nihongo||穣子|Minoriko}} can be split into {{nihongo||穣|minori}} what could mean "Bountiful", "Harvest" or "Seed-spreading" and {{nihongo||子|ko}} what could mean "child". "Minori" could also possibly refer to {{lang|ja|実り}} which means "ripening" or "harvest."

In her official profile of ''[[Mountain of Faith]]'', her name in Japanese was misspelled as {{nihongo||秋 '''稔'''子|Aki '''Minoru'''ko}}.

===Design===
Minoriko's ''Mountain of Faith'' portrait shows her having red eyes and blond hair. She wears a yellow blouse with poofy sleeves and a red dress which goes about halfway up her chest and has black straps over the shoulders. Over the dress there is a red apron which has a wheat pattern at the bottom, and her red hat has a cluster of blue grapes on the front. She doesn't have any footwear.

The Japanese term for {{nihongo|"scarecrow"|かかし|kakashi}}, came from ''kagashi'', which means "smeller". This may explain why Minoriko talks about her smell in [[Reimu Hakurei|Reimu]]'s scenario.

==Appearances==
===Games===
;[[Mountain of Faith]]
[[File:Th10MinorikoSprite.png|frame|Minoriko's sprite in ''MoF'']]
Minoriko fights Reimu or [[Marisa Kirisame|Marisa]] in ''Mountain of Faith'' near the [[Youkai Mountain]].
:{{Main|Mountain of Faith/Story/Reimu's Scenario#Stage 1|l1=Reimu Arc}}
Minoriko is afraid to be eaten by Reimu in their dialogue, as Reimu smells something tasty. Minoriko says the smell comes from her perfume made of freshly-harvested sweet potatoes. She is still afraid of getting eaten by Reimu when the fight starts, and gets defeated.
:{{Main|Mountain of Faith/Story/Marisa's Scenario#Stage 1|l1=Marisa Arc}}
Marisa says she could use some practice, and then Minoriko shows up. Minoriko says that the [[youkai]] in the Youkai Mountain are much different from those Marisa has already met and that she should be afraid of them, but Marisa isn't. Then Minoriko starts to fight, but is easily defeated by Marisa.

===Spin-offs===
;[[Double Spoiler]]
In ''[[Double Spoiler]]'', Minoriko was [[Aya Shameimaru|Aya]]'s practice partner, but she got annoyed and started to attack Aya. She appeared as a [[stage]] 1 target, where she uses a few [[spell card]]s and had [[Aya Shameimaru]] and [[Hatate Himekaidou]] take photos of her and her [[danmaku]].

;''Hopeless Masquerade''
[[File:Th135Minoriko.png|frame|Minoriko in ''HM'']]
Minoriko made a background cameo appearance in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'' on the [[Genbu Ravine]] and [[Youkai Tanuki Forest]] stage. She is seen with her sister [[Shizuha Aki]] cheering.

==Relationships==
;[[Shizuha Aki]]
Shizuha is her older sister. Together they control the season of fall.

===Minor Relationships===
;[[Aya Shameimaru]] 
She helped Aya for practicing photo shooting in ''Double Spoiler''. Eventually she got annoyed and attacked.

;People from the [[Human Village]]
Every year she is called by the villagers for the harvest festival. She guarantees them an abundant harvest.

==Additional Information==
*It makes very much sense for Minoriko to be the younger sister who is the goddess of the harvest as the harvest comes after the changing of the leaves in the season.
*Minoriko appeared on the cover of the demo CD of Mountain of Faith.
*Minoriko got a small reference in [[Sanae Kochiya|Sanae]]'s part of the ''[[Ten Desires]]'' [[Ten Desires/Story/Prologue|prologue]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ten Desires]]: Prologue — "''For example, prayers for a great harvest, or protection from misfortune...''"&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{nihongo|'''Mishaguji'''|ミシャグジ}} are curse gods native to the Suwa region. They are currently under the control of [[Suwako Moriya]], who brought them with her to [[Gensokyo]].

==General Information==
===Abilities===
The Mishaguji have abilities as curse gods and as harvest gods. Grain sprouts in their wake, but their breath can render land barren. Suwako also uses them to flatten land and dig tunnels to the [[Underworld]].

==Backstory==
The Mishaguji were powerful curse gods who amassed large amounts of faith by cursing harvests, births, and the militaries, amongst other things. Although they were fearsome, Suwako Moriya was able to tame them and bring them under her command, gaining a large amount of faith and establishing a small kingdom for herself in the process. When [[Kanako Yasaka]] invaded the kingdom and took control of the [[Moriya Shrine]], the shrine's followers feared that their new [[god]]dess would be unable to control the Mishaguji and did not give Kanako their faith, forcing her to seek Suwako's help.

==Character Basis==
===Design===
The Mishaguji have the appearance of large, spectral, white snakes, with glowing red eyes and mouths. [[Hieda no Akyuu]] describes them as being made of stone.

==Relationships==
'''[[Suwako Moriya]]'''

Suwako is the only one who is able to tame the Mishaguji, as well as the only one to be able to use them as [[spell card]]s.

{{nihongo|'''Misumaru Tamatsukuri'''|玉造 魅須丸|Tamatsukuri Misumaru}} is a [[god]] who initially appeared as the Stage 4 [[Boss|boss]] in ''[[Unconnected Marketeers]]''. She is also said to have crafted [[Reimu Hakurei]]'s [[Yin-Yang Orb|yin-yang orb]]s.

==General Information==
===Personality===
Misumaru has a stern, commanding presence, speaking formally and with authority. Despite her demeanor, her role in ''Unconnected Marketeers'' is that of a benefactor; she created the Hakurei yin-yang orbs, stops the protagonist from entering the [[Wikipedia:Anoxia|anoxic]] depths of the Rainbow Dragon Cave, advises her where to find the mastermind of the incident, and finally helps her in the Extra stage by selling her a card before her battle with [[Momoyo Himemushi]].

===Abilities===
She has the ability to craft various objects such as [[wikipedia:Magatama|magatama]] from ancient minerals that hold divine power. In the world of [[Touhou Project]], magatama have the power to copy and store parts of people's souls, including their abilities and memories. Misumaru is mainly shown using the power of her magatama to analyze information on people she encounters, as well as their thoughts.

According to her dialogue in [[Reimu Hakurei]]'s main scenario and hidden ending in ''[[Unconnected Marketeers]]'', she is also the one who crafted Reimu's [[Yin-Yang Orb]] from similar ancient materials.

==Character Design==
===Origin===

She is based on {{nihongo|Tamanooya-no-Mikoto|玉祖命}}, one of the amatsukami from the [[wikipedia:Kojiki|Kojiki]] who took part in luring Amaterasu out of the cave she was hiding in by creating the {{nihongo|Yasakani-no-magatama|八尺瓊勾玉}}. Tamanooya is also present later in the descent of Ninigi and conquest of the kunitsukami. He is the ancestral deity of the Tamatsukuri clan, who were associated with the production of jewelry, including magatama. Tamatsukuri is also the name of a Shinto shrine which enshrines Tamanooya. Other names of Tamanooya include {{nihongo|Toyotama-no-kami|豊玉神}} and {{nihongo|Ame-no-akaru-tama-no-mikoto|天明玉命}}, both mentioned in the [[wikipedia:Nihon_Shoki|Nihon Shoki]].

===Name===
In addition to the connection to the Tamatsukuri clan mentioned above, {{nihongo|Tamatsukuri|玉造}} also means jewel-maker.

In ancient times, ''misumaru'', written {{lang|ja|御統}}, referred to a chain or loop of threaded beads (often magatama), usually worn as a necklace.

===Design===
Misumaru has dark blonde, roughly shoulder-length hair that parts over her face and has reddish eyes. She wears a red top with white sleeves and a black ribbon around the waist and a yellow skirt. A few strands of hair left and right are tied together with a spherical ornament and she wears a similar ornament on her head. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mildom.com/10922924|title=東方ステーション　#27　東方虹龍洞特集 |trans-title=Touhou Station #27: Touhou Kouryuudou Edition|people=[[ZUN]]|type=Livestream|date=2021-07-17|website=Mildon|access-date=2021-07-17|language =Japanese|quote=「玉だよ。弾の神様、弾幕の神様？」}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is barefoot.

Magatama are incorporated throughout her clothing, for example, a magatama-shaped green pattern on the skirt and a dark red on the top, and magatama in rainbow colors adorn the hem of her skirt, the ends of the shawl around her waist, and a chain that runs across her wear over the upper body.

==Appearances==
[[File:Th18MisumaruSprite.png|frame|right|Misumaru's sprite in ''[[Unconnected Marketeers|UM]]'']]
===Games===
;''Unconnected Marketeers''
The protagonist encounters Misumaru deep in the mine, where she warns that there is no oxygen further in the cave and that the protagonist should turn around or she will die. When the protagonist ignores this warning, Misumaru fights her. The protagonist wins the spell card battle, but is exhausted by it and finally notices the effects of the low oxygen. Misumaru sells the protagonist a card and advises her to leave the mine and seek the true culprit at the top of the mountain, which she does.

In Reimu's good ending, Misumaru explains to her that she had nothing to do with the incident and that she was in the mine for the same reason as Reimu: she was concerned about the mining of Izanagi objects and was there to investigate it.

==Relationships==
;[[Reimu Hakurei]]
Although Reimu had not met her before the Ability Card Incident, she is responsible for creating the Hakurei [[Yin-Yang Orb]]s.

;[[Momoyo Himemushi]]
Misumaru is very critical of the mining in the Youkai Mountain and sent the protagonist to defeat [[Momoyo Himemushi]] during [[Unconnected Marketeers]]

===Minor Relationships===
;[[Hakurei God]]
Nothing is known about Misumaru's relationship with the Hakurei God, other than that she created the [[Yin-Yang Orb]]'s that it is enshrined within.

*In [[Story of Eastern Wonderland]], [[Mima]] says to [[Reimu]] "Only a blood member of the Hakurei Clan can use the Yin-Yang orbs"&lt;ref&gt;''[[Story of Eastern Wonderland]]'' - [[Story of Eastern Wonderland/Story/Regular Stages|Main Scenario]]&lt;/ref&gt;, though this may simply no longer be canon due to ZUN's continuity rule for Touhou.

Genuine Master Artisan of Magatama&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Misumaru Tamatsukuri&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Species: God&lt;br&gt;
Ability: Capable of making magatama&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

A god who produces magatama from ancient minerals.&lt;br&gt;
Magatama are magic items that can contain the souls of living things inside of them.&lt;br&gt;
While only to a slight extent, they can copy and store people's abilities, temperaments, and even memories.&lt;br&gt;
By using the power of a magatama, it's easy to do things like copy abilities, read information from a subject, and so on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The Dragon Gems being excavated in the Rainbow Dragon Cave are minerals that are well-suited to being made into magatama.&lt;br&gt;
She learned that [[Megumu Iizunamaru|a Great Tengu]] was boring tons of holes in the mountain to excavate them, and hurriedly set out ot investigate the site.&lt;br&gt;
This was because it'd be dangerous for the Dragon Gems to fall into the hands of evil. On top of that, she was concerned about the mountain's environmental destruction.&lt;br&gt;
She had, after all, seen countless old mines that had been carved out of mountains due to sheer greed, then tossed aside when their resources ran out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The Rainbow Dragon Cave's structure was labyrinthine, with its full layout still unknown.&lt;br&gt;
While she was investigating, a human came and delved inside.&lt;br&gt;
Upon using her magatama's power to see what their motive was, it appeared that they were investigating the Ability Cards.&lt;br&gt;
She turned them away, telling them that the caverns beyond were no place for humans to enter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

After that, she continued investigating the Rainbow Dragon Cave.&lt;br&gt;
In its far reaches, she found a dangerous youkai that was continually digging away at the mountain: [[Momoyo Himemushi|a giant centipede]]...

{{nihongo|'''Miyoi Okunoda'''|奥野田　美宵|Okunoda Miyoi}} is a [[Zashiki-warashi]] working at the [[Geidontei]] pub and the main protagonist of ''[[Lotus Eaters]]''.

==General Information==
Miyoi appears as the main protagonist in ''[[Lotus Eaters]]'' along with [[Reimu Hakurei]] and [[Marisa Kirisame]]. She is a zashiki-warashi that resides in Geidontei and possessed the [[Suika Ibuki#Possessions|Ibuki Gourd]] to see the world outside of the bar, attempting parties all over the place. 

===Personality===

Miyoi is a very emotional individual overall. Primarily, she is upbeat and friendly while working at the pub. However, she has a mischievous side, which is often shown when manipulating memories. She's also known to be easily agitated when a dilemma transpires.

===Abilities===
; Capable of Manipulating Memories

Miyoi can manipulate the memories of anyone as long as they're drunk. So far it's been shown that she can induce hallucinations, plant false memories, and make anyone forget about certain events.&lt;ref name="LE1&gt;[[Lotus Eaters]] - Chapter 9&lt;/ref&gt;

===Occupation===

She's the poster girl of Geidontei. This means that she is a representative of the bar. She doesn't seem to actually be the one owning the bar, but is seen delivering the drinks to customers, so she's considered the waitress.

It's unknown how long she's worked there, but It's mentioned by her that she had lived before the bar was called Geidontei and before it had It's current owner after Suika told Miyoi about her possessing the Ibuki Gourd without permission.&lt;ref&gt; [[Lotus Eaters]] - Chapter 6&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character Design==

===Name===
Her first name is {{nihongo|'''Miyoi'''|美宵}}, and means "beautiful evening". Her last name, {{nihongo|'''Okunoda'''|奥野田}}, might be a reference to the japanese winery [http://web.okunota.com/ of the same name].

===Design===
Miyoi has pink hair and green eyes. Her right sidelock is shaped like a hook. She wears a blue hat shaped like a whale and a blue apron with a stylized drawing of a whale. The whale is the symbol of Geidontei. Her shirt is light blue and long-sleeved with crossed ribbons on the chest, the sleeves are usually rolled up when she is working. Her skirt is purple with red and white papers stuck on them, resembling the Ibuki Gourd.

Before she possessed the Ibuki Gourd, she wore a short kimono instead of a shirt and skirt. The kimono had cloud patterns on it

==Appearances==

===Literature===

;''Lotus Eaters''

Miyoi is introduced reassuring some of Geidontei's customers who were worried about a human abduction that no youkai comes to the pub and offers some sake on the house. At night, she arrives to the Hakurei Shrine to offers some stewed veggies at a party, but in secret, she manipulates the memories of the party attendants by giving them hallucinations of an ancient boar. The next morning, Miyoi meets Reimu and tells her that the human who was missing has been found and is returning to the pub. She then waves her goodbye before stating that she will return the next time a banquet is held. Miyoi returns to the Shrine offering stewed veggies yet again, however she was quickly restrained by Reimu the moment she sees her. She then tells everyone who she is and how she was able to meet Suika and entered the Ibuki Gourd.

Over the course of the story, Miyoi meets Mamizou and Aya and after befriending them, they decided to open Geidontei as a youkai nightclub, naming it the Sanshoku Geidontei.

==Relationships== 

===Sanshoku Geidontei's Regulars===
Throughout ''Lotus Eaters'', Miyoi has befriended a few [[youkai]] as her customers. Apart from being good drinking buddies, they also help Miyoi with any dilemmas she faces. 

;[[Suika Ibuki]]

At first, Miyoi moved into the [[Suika Ibuki#Possessions|Ibuki Gourd]] without Suika's permission to be able to see the world outside of [[Geidontei]]. Suika is aware of this but lets Miyoi do as she pleased for a while. After she questions Miyoi's motives, they got along quite well and came to an agreement: Suika will let Miyoi stay in the Ibuki Gourd whenever she wants to and, in return, Miyoi will keep Geidontei open late whenever Suika stops by.

;[[Mamizou Futatsuiwa]]

Miyoi at first met Mamizou on bad terms because Mamizou wanted to evict Miyoi out of Geidontei in threat of revealing her secret thus ruining the pub's image. When she found out that she only did this to open a youkai-only pub after hours with the help of Suika, she was excited to hear that and agree with the terms. 

;[[Aya Shameimaru]]

Aya was planning to expose Miyoi's identity to the public, which frightened the poster girl. After changing her mind, Miyoi was happy to have her as a customer.

===Minor Relationships===
;[[Minor_Characters#Geidontei.27s_Owner|Geidontei's Owner]]

Her relationship with the owner is a mystery. Miyoi tells Marisa that he probably isn't aware of her working there, but Marisa mentions that he talked to her like he was her "grand-daughter", in which Miyoi doesn't respond directly but instead gives off an eerie grin. &lt;ref&gt; [[Lotus Eaters]] - Chapter 3 &lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Mizuchi Miyadeguchi'''|宮出口　瑞霊|Miyadeguchi Mizuchi}} is the main antagonist of [[Foul Detective Satori]].


==General Information==

===Personality===

===Abilities===
;Capable of possessing people.
She has the ability of possessing people, taking complete control of their body and even their abilities. Her victims have no memories of anything that happened during the time that they were possessed. Using this possession ability on [[Youkai]] will result in them falling in to a coma by draining all of their magical energy, this will not be the case on humans however, as unlike youkai, they are not composed of magic energy.

==Backstory==
Mizuchi is a vengeful spirit that escaped from former hell, prompting [[Satori Komeji]] to search for her.

==Character Design==
===Origin===

===Name===
Her full name is {{nihongo|''Mizuchi Miyadeguchi''|宮出口　瑞霊}}. Her surname {{nihongo|''Miyadeguchi''|宮出口}} contains the kanji {{nihongo|"miya"|宮}}, which can translate to "shrine" (in Shinto context) or "palace". &lt;br&gt;{{nihongo|"Deguchi"|出口}} is a term that translates to "exit".&lt;br&gt;

{{nihongo|''Mizuchi''|瑞霊}} roughly translates to "young spirit". "Mizu" in this case is an archaic term that can be translated as "pure" or "young".

===Design===
She wears a dress of unknown colour with lines and frills. She has a pair of handcuffs with one end being attached to her neck. She also wears a pair of gloves.

==Appearances==
===Literature===
;[[Foul Detective Satori]]
In [[Foul Detective Satori]], Mizuchi takes possession of people and makes them fall into a coma by draining their magic energy. She picks her victims in the order of the series' incidents (Scarlet Mist Incident, Spring Snow Incident, Eternal Night Incident)&lt;ref&gt;However, after Yuyuko, her next possession target should have been Suika due to the "Night Parade of One Hundred Oni Every Four Days" incident in [[Immaterial and Missing Power]], why this was skipped is unknown.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mizuchi also started with the incident of Touhou 6, ignoring all the characters of the PC-98 era. Though this is likely because the Windows series follows a different continuity from the PC-98 series.&lt;/ref&gt;,meaning that she has been watching Reimu for a very long time.

==Relationships==
Mizuchi has a dislike for both Gensokyo and its inhabitants, especially [[Reimu Hakurei]], who seems to be her main target for revenge for as of yet unknown reasons. &lt;br&gt;
She dislikes the lack of chaos in the current Gensokyo - and doesn't mind helping the "unnatural order" collapse.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

She appears to have no allies; she had received help from others only by deception, taking advantage of her ability to possess other people's bodies and manipulating friends and allies of the target.

{{nihongo|'''Mizue no Uranoshimako'''|水江 浦嶋子}} appears in Chapter 3 of ''[[Cage in Lunatic Runagate]]'' in flashback, as told by [[Watatsuki no Toyohime]] and [[Watatsuki no Yorihime]].

==Character Basis==
===Origin===
Mizue no Uranoshimako is otherwise known as {{nihongo|[[Wikipedia:Urashima Tarou|Urashima Tarou]]|{{lang|ja|浦島 太郎}}}}, a fisherman who was spirited away to {{nihongo|[[Wikipedia:Ryuuguu-jou|Ryuuguu-jou]]|{{lang|ja|竜宮城}}/{{lang|ja|龍宮城}}}}, the undersea palace of {{nihongo|[[Wikipedia:Ryujin|Ryuujin]]|{{lang|ja|龍神}}|lit. ''dragon god''}}. There, he met the Ryuujin and his daughter, [[Wikipedia:Otohime|Otohime]], resided three days, and longing for his village, returned and found that three hundred years had passed. Despairing, he opened a box that Otohime had given him, upon which his age returned, and died.

Today, Urashima-jinja in Ine, Kyoto on Tango Peninsula stands dedicated to him, and [[Wikipedia:Time dilation|time dilation]] is sometimes referred to as the Urashima effect.

===Name===
The name Urashima Taro first appears in the 15th century, in the book [[Wikipedia:Otogizōshi|Otogizoshi]], but the story of Uranoshimako is much older, dating back to the 8th century. These older works, the [[Wikipedia:Nihon Shoki|Nihon Shoki]], [[Wikipedia:Man'yōshū|Man'yoshu]], and {{nihongo|Tango no Kuni Fudoki|{{lang|ja|丹後国風土記}}}}, all refer to Tarou as Uranoshimako. This is because of a change in Japanese naming customs; in the previous eras, -ko (child) was used for both male and female names, while in later times it was mostly a female name element, replaced with -tarou (great youth) in boys' names.

==Story==
;''Cage in Lunatic Runagate''
:{{Main|Cage in Lunatic Runagate/Third Chapter|l1=Cage in Lunatic Runagate Chapter 3}}

After [[Eirin Yagokoro]] warns them of the incoming youkai invasion from Earth told in [[Silent Sinner in Blue]], [[Watatsuki no Toyohime]] and [[Watatsuki no Yorihime]] watch over the Sea of Tranquility for any sign of them. Meanwhile, they begin to reminisce about Uranoshimako, a fisherman from 1500 years ago, who saw a turtle with a shell of five colors. He chased the turtle and dove into sea to catch it, but found his boat gone. Clinging on to the turtle, he soon found himself in the Sea of Tranquility on the [[Moon]]. Thinking the Lunar Capital was the legendary land of [[Wikipedia:Hourai|Hourai]], he came onto land and was found by a curious Toyohime, who let him stay. 

Instead of Hourai, or the Lunar Capital, she told him it was the Dragon King's Palace. He remained for three years in the "Dragon King's Palace", but began yearning for home. Toyohime feared he would tell the Earthlings about the Capital and informed Eirin about him, who suggested he be killed. Because the sisters were too kind for that, it was instead decided to place him in cryogenic stasis and send him back at a time when nobody would remember who he was, three hundred years into the future.

Upon returning to his village, no one remembered who Uranoshimako was, and he fell into despair. At that time, Eirin, now living on Earth with [[Kaguya Houraisan|Kaguya]], sent Uranoshimako a [[Wikipedia:tamakushige|tamakushigi]]. Once he opened it, his body aged instantly and he became old and frail. However, with proof of his voyage, the villagers treated him with reverence. His story reached [[Wikipedia:Emperor Junna|Emperor Junna]], who thought it proof of Hourai and wanted to see him, but by then Uranoshimako had died and Junna built a temple in his honor.

In the end, Uranoshimako strengthened people's faith in the land of Hourai, in the Lunar Capital, and made all of the era's authority figures aware of the majesty of its people, and was enshrined as a God. Meanwhile, the Watatsukis learned a lesson about not taking in any lost travelers after that, and claim themselves to not be as foolish or nice as they were when they took Uranoshimako in.

{{nihongo|'''Momiji Inubashiri'''|犬走 椛|Inubashiri Momiji}} is a [[Hakurou Tengu|white wolf tengu]] whose duty is to patrol the [[Youkai Mountain]]. Her good sense of smell and sight are helpful for this duty. Momiji does not have an official game portrait, only a sprite from ''[[Mountain of Faith]]'', ''[[Double Spoiler]]'' and ''[[Impossible Spell Card]]''. However, she does have some appearances in print works.

==General Information==
Momiji has got a very co-operative personality who executes her duties faithfully. In her free time, she plays [[wikipedia:Dai shogi|dai shōgi]] with the [[kappa]].

===Ability===
;Seeing a thousand ri ahead
Momiji has a telegnosis ability that allows her to see a thousand [[Wikipedia:Li (unit)|ri]] ahead (approximately 3,927 kilometres, or 2,440 miles). She also has a superior sense of smell, that combined with her ability makes her able to detect any intruder in an instant.

;Abilities as tengu
Akyuu describes tengu as one of the strongest species, both in physical and sorcerous abilities. While nothing about Momiji herself has especially come to light, she is likely to possess some of those traits, such as their (almost) unmatched speed.

===Occupation===
One of the [[Youkai Mountain]] tengu's patrols. Her job is to attempt to stop intruders on the mountain with simple attacks and report any that were undeterred to [[Tenma]].

==Character Basis==
Momiji's wolf-like appearance may be a reference to the [[Wikipedia:Tiangou|Tiangou]], a Chinese version of a tengu that is described to be more dog-like.

===Name===
[[File:MomijiOSP.jpg|thumb|right|140px|Momiji as she appears in ''[[Oriental Sacred Place]]''.]]
Her full name is {{nihongo|''Momiji Inubashiri''|犬走　椛}}. {{nihongo||犬走|Inubashiri|lit. "dog run"}} is an actual used (but very rare) surname in Japan. It refers to the dirt path outside of building or residence used for patrols ("[[wikipedia:Berm|berm]]" is corresponded to the term in this usage on the English Wikipedia) — the etymology of this word comes from the fact that the path is so narrow that only a dog can rush through it in a very short time, which has effect to give Momiji's image her speedy might. But the word also indicates her simple-but-fundamental social class; she protects the basement of architecture from erosion, like the occupation of white wolf tengu. ''Momiji'' is one of several Japanese names for maple trees (read same, but written as {{lang|ja|紅葉}} in this usage). The kanji used in her name {{lang|ja|椛}} refers to "birch". Maple, however makes more sense as she has a maple leaf depicted on her shield.

===Design===
Momiji only has a small sprite used in ''Mountain of Faith'', ''Double Spoiler'' and ''Impossible Spell Card'', so an accurate description is not possible, but from the sprite, we see that she wears a white, long-sleeved shirt, and a large black skirt with red flame-like designs reaching up from the bottom of the skirt, and that it has a white layer below her skirt. She has short light silver hair and wears a red [[Wikipedia:Tokin (headwear)|tokin]]. She holds a large scimitar-like sword and a white, round shield with a red maple leaf print on it.

In a later appearance in ''[[Oriental Sacred Place]]'', it is seen she has detached sleeves and wolf ears. However, in ''[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]]'', she is seen without wolf ears.

==Story==
===Windows Games===
;Mountain of Faith
:{{Main|Mountain of Faith/Story|l1=Mountain of Faith Story}}
Momiji is the [[stage]] 4 [[midboss]] of ''[[Mountain of Faith]]''. When the heroine finally reached [[Youkai Mountain]] during ''[[Mountain of Faith]]'', Momiji attempted to stop her at the waterfall. Although Momiji was unsuccessful, it seems she did fulfill her duty of reporting the intruder's presence back to the other [[tengu]] with record speed, as a reinforcement tengu named [[Aya Shameimaru]] had arrived by the end of the same stage to investigate what was going on.

Later, Momiji observed the final battles between the heroine and the newly appeared shrine and its god, apparently without being noticed by either of them.

===Spin-offs===
;Double Spoiler
Momiji is one of the many who has her [[danmaku]] photographed by [[Aya Shameimaru]] and [[Hatate Himekaidou]], which appears on stage 4.
[[File:ThGK Bunbunmaru11.jpg|thumb||Momiji as she appears in ''[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]].'']]
;Impossible Spell Card
Momiji attacks [[Seija Kijin]] on the [[Youkai Mountain]] on day 6, using a [[spell card]] that is considered impossible to dodge. It's unknown if Momiji actually went out searching for Seija like many others, or if she was just doing her job of keeping Seija away from the Youkai Mountain.

===Literature===
;Symposium of Post-mysticism
:{{Main|Symposium of Post-mysticism/Bunbunmaru Newspaper 11|l1=Symposium of Post-mysticism: Momiji's Bunbunmaru Article}}
Back in 1963, Momiji had discovered new Shogi pieces from the [[outside world]] in [[Muenzuka]]. Having believed that the tengu were the only ones creating unique rules for the game, she became a bit frustrated that the same thing was happening in the outside world. She wanted to see how Shogi had developed in the outside world, then speculated that the game had become simplified, because the pieces she found couldn't be promoted.
;Oriental Sacred Place 

;Wild and Horned Hermit   

;Forbidden Scrollery 
In chapter 33, she makes a appearence with Aya and Hatate. In chapter 45, she's seen with Hatate in a storm trying to escape it. 

;Alternative Facts in Eastern Utopia 

She had her own article in Alternatve Facts in Eastern Utopia about the new ropeway at Youkai Mountain. 

;The Grimoire of Usami

==Relationships==
;[[Aya Shameimaru]] and [[Hatate Himekaidou]]
When she meets Aya they often get into fights with each other. [[Double Spoiler/Spell Cards/Stage 4|According to Aya]], Momiji looks down on her and the other crow tengu. Hatate, however, implies that this is only a personal feud between Momiji and Aya.

;[[Tenma]]
She is very loyal to the chief of the tengu, Lord Tenma.

;[[Kappa]]
As said in her profile, she's an avid player of [[wikipedia:Dai shogi|Dai Shōgi]], which she plays with the [[kappa]] when she is bored.

| translation = Stage 4 Midboss '''The Petty Patrol Tengu'''&lt;br/&gt;
Momiji Inubashiri

Species: White Wolf Tengu&lt;br/&gt;
Ability: Seeing a thousand ri ahead&lt;br/&gt;

A tengu that patrols the Youkai Mountain. Thanks to her superior senses of sight and smell, she can detect any intruder in an instant. When she discovers intruders she attempts to intimidate them with simple attacks, and once they cannot handle the intruders, they reports to the [[Tengu#Great Tengu|Great Tengu]].

Her forces are usually lying in wait behind the waterfall. She has a very cooperative personality and executes her duties faithfully. This is unusual for youkai, but not uncommon in tengu society.

However, she usually has a lot of free time, as the Youkai Mountain doesn't receive many intruders. While awaiting orders, she enjoys playing a rather time-consuming game called Dai shogi with the nearby [[kappa]].

It's hard for the especially long-lived youkai to find good ways to pass the time.

{{nihongo|'''Momoyo Himemushi'''|姫虫　百々世|Himemushi Momoyo}} is an ''oomukade'', a giant centipede-like youkai purportedly powerful enough to eat dragons. Her first appearance was in [[Unconnected Marketeers]] as the Extra Stage [[Boss|boss]].
==General Information==
===Personality===
In ''Unconnected Marketeers'', Momoyo talks in a very direct, casual, and somewhat masculine way, wasting no time with formalities or pleasantries. She also seems to enjoy jokes, saying ''"The Hakurei shrine maiden!? Ahh, yep. That's her dumb face, all right. Heh-heh-heh. Beg your pardon."'' in front of [[Reimu Hakurei]]. She seems somewhat gullible, but perhaps it boils down to less of a concern with "truth" as it is with doing her job and demonstrating her immense power to others. Despite that, she does care about fairness to some degree, as seen in [[Marisa Kirisame]]'s route in the game where she agrees to give Marisa some of the gems found in the ''Rainbow Dragon Cave'' if Marisa won their duel, and honouring that agreement when Marisa wins. She seems to enjoy duelling and fighting in general, valuing strength in others above all else, as seen when she compliments the protagonist on her fighting ability after their duel, and invites the protagonist to a rematch someday in the future.

===Abilities===
;General
In the foothills, ''oomukade'' (lit. giant centipede) are feared as the most powerful of the dragon-slaying youkai, and even dragons themselves don't dare approach them. It's unknown if their reputation extends outside that specific area. They wield great power tempered by the negative aura cast upon them, and Momoyo herself possesses enormous magical power. Legends about her might are also fueled by the fact that almost no one approaches her at all.&lt;ref name="momoyo profile"&gt;[[Unconnected Marketeers]] - Momoyo's profile &lt;/ref&gt;

;Eating dragons
Momoyo's stated ability. It's unknown if she can actually eat dragons.&lt;ref name="momoyo profile" /&gt;

==Background Information==
===Origin===
Momoyo might be based on the oomukade from [[Wikipedia:Tawara Tōda Monogatari|The Tale of Tawara Toda]], as that monster was also known to eat dragons.

Centipedes were also associated with wealth, especially precious ores, and in that capacity were sometimes viewed as messengers of Bishamonten.

===Name===
Her surname, {{nihongo|''Himemushi''|姫虫}}, contains the kanji for {{nihongo|''princess''|姫|''hime''}} and {{nihongo|''insect''|虫|''mushi''}}, as if to signify "insect royalty." Given her stated powers as being potentially more powerful than dragons, it may indicate a sense of power, although it seems unlikely she is considered true royalty. This name is also a reference to the 2004 shoot-'em-up game, {{nihongo|Mushihime-sama|虫姫さま}}, a connection reinforced by the fact that her final spell card is named {{nihongo|"Mushihime-sama's Resplendent and Restless Daily Life"|蟲姫さまの輝かしく落ち着かない毎日}}.

Her given name, {{nihongo|''Momoyo''|百々世}}, means "eternity" or "long era." The {{lang|ja|百}} ("hundred") in her name is likely derived from {{lang|ja|百足}} ''mukade'' ("centipede").

===Design===
In ''Unconnected Marketeers'', Momoyo wears a black shirt and black skirt with yellow highlights. Throughout her outfit are bright green chain-links running along the edges of the fabric and being worn as a belt. She has bows wrapped around her arms and legs, and a larger one on her back, perhaps signifying the segmented body of a [[Wikipedia:centipede|centipede]], which ''oomukade'' are based on. She carries a brass-coloured shovel and pickax, presumably as tools for her job mining the ''Rainbow Dragon Cave''.

A part of her hair also has the shape of a centipede fang.

==Story==
[[File:Th18MomoyoSprite.png|frame|right|Momoyo's sprite in ''[[Unconnected Marketeers|UM]]'']]
===Games===
;''Unconnected Marketeers''
Momoyo appears as the Extra boss of the game. The player enters the Rainbow Dragon Cave and after defeating Tsukasa gets spotted by Momoyo, who thinks [[Misumaru]] and the player are the thieves [[Tsukasa]] mentioned, and attacks the player. After getting defeated, Momoyo comments she was pleased to fight someone so strong, and invites the player to a rematch in the future.

==Relationships==
;[[Megumu Iizunamaru]]
Momoyo works with her, and unlike Megumu's hostile relationship with Chimata Tenkyuu, the two are friends. Momoyo values ​​the Tengu because she dared to face her, while most hide from Oomukade like her, and also because Megumu is a natural fighter.

;[[Tsukasa Kudamaki]]
As Megumu Iizunamaru's (supposed) subordinate, they know each other. Tsukasa manipulates Momoyo like everyone else, so she triggers the fight against Momoyo and the protagonist in the extra stage. Momoyo, in turn, threatens Tsukasa and blackmails her to keep silent about the fact that she is leaving treasures to [[Marisa Kirisame]] for her victory.

;[[Misumaru Tamatsukuri]]
Misumaru Tamatsukuri, who is very reluctant to mine the Youkai Mountain and dig for dragon stones, instructs the protagonist to stop Momoyo. Misumaru's attempt to negotiate with Momoyo is thwarted by Tsukasa Kudamaki.

==Additional Information==
* Momoyo is currently the only character in the series to use ''ore'' (俺) to refer to herself. It is generally considered a very informal masculine-sounding pronoun.
* Assuming that Momoyo ''is'' the Great Centipede from ''The Tale of Tawara Toda'', she was once killed by [[Wikipedia:Fujiwara no Hidesato|Fujiwara no Hidesato]], who was [[Fujiwara no Mokou|Fujiwara no Mokou's]] great-great-great-great nephew.
* Momoyo's in-game spell card cutin doesn't have any white color around her eyes.

Onyx Dragon-Eater&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Momoyo Himemushi&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Species: Oomukade&lt;br&gt;
Ability: Capable of eating dragons&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The giant centipede.&lt;br&gt;
A youkai that's despised for various reasons, such as its grotesque form and unpleasant toxins.&lt;br&gt;
Even massive dragons don't dare approach them. In the foothills, they're feared as the most powerful of the dragon-slaying youkai.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

They hold gigantic magic power tempered by the aura of negativity cast upon them, and her magic is particularly strong.&lt;br&gt;
Hardly anyone tries to approach her in the first place, which likewise adds fuel to her legends of supreme might.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

To be completely honest, nobody knows whether she can actually eat a dragon or not.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

But it's true that she was fishing around in the Rainbow Dragon Cave for "dragon gems," which are said to be held by dragons.&lt;br&gt;
As she began excavating dragon gems from the caves, she was approached with a business proposal by her friend [[Megumu Iizunamaru|Iizunamaru]],&lt;br&gt;
a Great Tengu who didn't mind meeting her in person.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Momoyo accepted the job of excavator, carving out the mountain to mine the Rainbow Dragon Cave. Her payment was in dragon gems.&lt;br&gt;
The dragon gems were a good enough substitute for eating her Great Tengu friend, Megumu (whose name is written as 'dragon').&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

As she was diligently digging up dragon gems every day, she was told that a looter had finally arrived in the mine.&lt;br&gt;
She was thrilled, of course.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

"I'm sick of eatin' dragon gems by now.&lt;br&gt;
A mine looter will make for the best dessert around!"

{{nihongo|'''Mononobe no Futo'''|物部　布都}} is a [[shikaisen]], formerly a hermit practicing [[Taoism]]. She possesses the ability to manipulate [[wikipedia:Feng shui|feng shui]], and originates from the Asuka era.

==General Information==
Futo first stands against the player in stage 5 of ''[[Ten Desires]]'', as well as being a support partner for the stage 6 boss. She later became a playable character in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'', was a 9th Day Boss in ''[[Impossible Spell Card]]'' and appeared in ''[[Urban Legend in Limbo]]'', again as a playable character.

She is generally thought to be a [[shikaisen]], meaning that she was once a hermit who attempted to surpass the physical lifespan of a human by taking on the qualities of the dead. She essentially abandoned her body and transferred her soul into an object (said to be a plate). As a shikaisen, she is able to take on a great number of forms, but she prefers the traditional look she had when she was alive, as opposed to [[Toyosatomimi no Miko]]'s decision to go with a more modern form.

In her official profile, [[ZUN]] lists her as a "Taoist self-identifying as a shikaisen", but it can be inferred from her backstory as well as her article in ''[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]]'' that she is a bona-fide shikaisen.

===Personality===
Futo is described as being gentle at heart, but unable to adapt to modern times along with modern [[Gensokyo]] in general. [[Hieda no Akyuu]] points out in ''[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]]'' that because of it, she has an extremely "hermit-like" personality. Even in ancient times, she clung to [[Taoism]] rather than [[Buddhism]], indicating a dislike of change and a favoring of old ways. She is friendly towards [[human]]s, even going so far as to save them on occasion, but hostile towards [[youkai]] for some reason. [[Toyosatomimi no Miko]] describes her as being a scaredy-cat, though her "fear" of Buddhist statues led to her burning them (and temples) down to the ground (as the head of the Mononobe clan).

In speech, she speaks with in an archaic Japanese language. In first person, she uses {{nihongo||我|wa|archaic for "I"}} and in second person, {{nihongo||おぬし|onushi|archaic for "you"}}. In her speech and conduct, she attaches {{nihongo||ぞ|zo}} to the end of her sentences for emphasis, which is a little old-fashioned. Based on this, it would be no problem to think that she was probably born a long time ago and that she has a certain aura of nobility, never saying anything wild or off-beat.

She says things which indicate that she might have a tendency to misunderstand others a little, for example she automatically thought that the heroine of ''[[Ten Desires]]'' had come to her for a blessing in order to recover. Thus she is a manifestation of the "idiot child", this may relate to how well she takes her defeat in general, sometimes praising the heroine. After battles, she always makes the excuse that she has not shown her true strength.

===Abilities===
;Manipulating [[wikipedia:Feng Shui|feng shui]]
Futo is apparently able to manipulate feng shui. This ability is mentioned in ''[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]]'', where it is said that it's a power Futo aquired before studying [[Taoism]] and that due to the similarities in terms of worshipping nature, it's something almost identical to [[Shinto]]. Feng shui is the flow of [[wikipedia:Qi|qi]], particularly the flow of qi according to the environment. To manipulate feng shui is to apply some treatment to the surrounding environment and artificially change the flow of qi and it is something that manipulates fate and fortune. Although it has a high effect on fixed things like towns and houses, its effect is thin on things that busily move, like people and animals.

In terms of practical applications, Futo seems able to manipulate dragon veins to change the nearby ground,&lt;ref&gt;[[Hopeless Masquerade/Spell Cards/Mononobe no Futo|Hopeless Masquerade - Mononobe no Futo's Spell Cards]]: '''''Standing Mountain''''' skill&lt;/ref&gt; controlling fire,&lt;ref&gt;[[Hopeless Masquerade/Spell Cards/Mononobe no Futo|Hopeless Masquerade - Mononobe no Futo's Spell Cards]]: '''''Liuren Holy Fire''''' skill, '''''Blaze Sign "Taiyi True Fire"''''' '''''Inferno Reformation''''' Spell Cards&lt;/ref&gt; wind,&lt;ref&gt;[[Hopeless Masquerade/Spell Cards/Mononobe no Futo|Hopeless Masquerade - Mononobe no Futo's Spell Cards]]: '''''Combination Wind''''' and '''''Wind's Ominous Hole''''' skills '''''Wind Sign "Miwa Plate Storm"''''' Spell Card&lt;/ref&gt; and water,&lt;ref&gt;[[Hopeless Masquerade/Spell Cards/Mononobe no Futo|Hopeless Masquerade - Mononobe no Futo's Spell Cards]]: '''''Water-Embracing Plates'''''&lt;/ref&gt; and even lowering the amount of fortune in a determinated area.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hopeless Masquerade/Spell Cards/Mononobe no Futo|Hopeless Masquerade - Mononobe no Futo's Spell Cards]]: '''''Fate "Gate Opening for Catastrophe"'''''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Occupation===
Futo currently serves [[Toyosatomimi no Miko]] and resides in the [[Hall of Dreams' Great Mausoleum]] while practicing [[Taoism]].

===Possessions===
A plate is mentioned as the object Futo used to transfer her soul into in order to become a [[shikaisen]] and she seems to carry several plates in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]''. In addition, she is seen riding a boat during some of her spell cards in ''[[Ten Desires]]'', ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'' and ''[[Impossible Spell Card]]''.

==Backstory==
Futo originated in the Mononobe clan, widely known to be a Shinto-worshipping clan. However, she was actually a worshipper of Taoism. She decided to practice her Taoism in secret, as it lacked political power due to the fact that anyone can undergo the training required to become a hermit. [[Toyosatomimi no Miko]] eventually approached her and proposed a plan: Miko would pacify the nation under [[Buddhism]], but she and Futo would die and be reborn as shikaisen. Futo agreed, and managed to ally herself with the Soga clan to get them to follow Buddhism blindly.

After the Mononobe clan caught wind of this, a religious war ensued between them and the Soga clan. The Mononobe clan was eventually defeated after numerous harsh battles that left many Buddhist temples and artifacts destroyed; and thus the nation was united under Buddhism.

Once the battles ended, Futo finally attempted the process of becoming a shikaisen by "dying". Miko soon followed suit and they both ended up in [[Gensokyo]].

==Character Design==
[[File:ThGKFuto.png|thumb|right|150px|Futo, as illustrated in ''[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]]'']]
===Origin===
The [[wikipedia:Mononobe clan|Mononobe clan]] was a family who waged a fierce political battle with the [[Wikipedia:Soga clan|Soga clan]] over Buddhism. In particular, [[Wikipedia:Soga no Umako|Soga no Umako]] and [[wikipedia:Mononobe no Moriya|Mononobe no Moriya]] were two very influential courtiers to [[Wikipedia:Emperor Bidatsu|Emperor Bidatsu]] and his brother, [[Wikipedia:Emperor Yōmei|Emperor Youmei]], who was the father of [[Wikipedia:Prince Shōtoku|Prince Shoutoku]]. Both Youmei and Shoutoku were proponents of Buddhism, which led to victory for Umako, whose forces killed Moriya and his allies in the [[Wikipedia:Battle of Shigisan|Battle of Shigisan]] in 587.

Of the Mononobe, there existed {{nihongo|Futsuhime|布都姫}}, who was the little sister of Mononobe no Moriya. In the [[Wikipedia:Nihon Shoki|Nihon Shoki]], she was Soga no Umako's wife, although her name was never mentioned there. But according to the book, Umako "gratuitously killed Moriya by carrying out his wife's plot". So, according to this account, Futsuhime was a collaborator to Soga clan and a traitor to the Mononobe, despite her lineage. Furthermore, Umako and his wife are thought to have given birth to Tojiko no Iratsume. Other historical documents tell different accounts. For example, in the [[Wikipedia:Kujiki|Sendai Kuji Hongi]], she was married to [[Wikipedia:Emperor Sushun|Emperor Sushun]] and later to Mononobe no Nieko no Muraji, who was Mononobe no Moriya's little brother and Futsuhime's half brother.

While it's fairly clear that Futo draws inspirations as far as her actions go from Futsuhime, according to ZUN from an interview, [[Febri/Ten_Desires_and_Touhou_Project_interview_with_ZUN_Part1|"Though their names are similar they are different people"]].

===Name===
Her full name is {{nihongo|''Mononobe no Futo''|物部　布都}}. She takes the name {{nihongo|''Mononobe''|物部}} as a member of the Mononobe clan. Her given name, {{nihongo|''Futo''|布都|lit. "cloth city/capital/metropolis"}}, is derived from the name {{nihongo|''Futsuhime''|布都姫}}, whom her name was based off on.

===Design===
In ''[[Ten Desires]]'''s official art, Mononobe no Futo has grey eyes, grey hair and is dressed in a uniform which resembles Heian Era clothing such as a {{nihongo|''kariginu''|狩衣||lit. "hunting dress"}} or a {{nihongo|''suikan''|水干||lit. "dried with water"}}, modified with the addition of a purple skirt, with an {{nihongo|''eboshi''|烏帽子}} atop her head. Kariginu or suikan were worn for everyday clothes by the male {{nihongo|''Kuge''|公家|"people of the Imperial Court"}} in the Heian Era. The ribbons wrapped around various parts of her outfit (i.e. her neck, shoes, hat, and sleeves) all correspond to the five colors of Feng Shui. &lt;ref&gt;[[Strange Creators of Outer World/Who's Who of Humans &amp; Youkai in Gensokyo|Who's Who of Humans and Youkai in Gensokyo]] - [[Strange Creators of Outer World/Who's Who of Humans &amp; Youkai in Gensokyo/Mononobe no Futo and Soga no Tojiko|Mononobe no Futo and Soga no Tojiko]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearances==
===Games===
;''[[Ten Desires]]''
[[File:Th13FutoSprite.png|frame|Futo's sprite in ''TD'']]
When the heroine reaches the [[Hall of Dreams' Great Mausoleum]] in stage 5, Futo appears to them, having been reborn as a shikaisen. She challenges the heroine, thinking that she is the final trial to be overcome in her resurrection. After she is defeated, however, she realizes that the spirits of desire are actually flooding into the mausoleum in anticipation of [[Toyosatomimi no Miko]]'s resurrection rather than her own.

===Spin-offs===
;''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]''
Futo initially approaches the [[Hakurei Shrine]] after Miko defeated [[Reimu Hakurei]] in combat, and she wants an explanation. However, Reimu has shut herself in, and Futo ends up battling [[Marisa Kirisame]] first. After emerging victorious, she approaches [[Koishi Komeiji]] for the same reason. She then travels to the [[Myouren Temple]], where she reveals her goal to [[Ichirin Kumoi]] - that their respective religions unite for the common good of the suffering people. Ichirin insists that [[Byakuren Hijiri]] has it under control, and that they need no help from the likes of a taoist. After Futo defeats her, she is impressed and invites her to convert; Ichirin refuses, prompting Futo to mention the fact that she drinks alcohol.

Futo then wanders to the [[Youkai Mountain]], having realized that Miko already resolved the incident. There, she runs into [[Nitori Kawashiro]], who is taking down her stall. Futo inquires as to the details of Nitori's battle with Miko, but Nitori couldn't care less about the religious war. This prompts her to attempt to convert Nitori, but after she defeats the [[kappa]], Nitori decides that if she were to become a religious believer, she'd probably go to Shinto rather than Taoism, much to Futo's dismay. As Futo returns to the [[Human Village]], she encounters Miko herself, and they engage in battle. However, it was actually [[Mamizou Futatsuiwa]] in disguise, and after Futo loses all her popularity in the process of defeating her, she battles Mamizou in her true form. After defeating her again, Mamizou explains that she was only looking out for the humans, and that someone is behind all this.

Futo encounters [[Hata no Kokoro]] that night, who is trying to figure out what to do with her time until Miko creates a new Mask of Hope for her. Unfortunately, the two end up fighting each other. After defeating her, Futo returns to the Mausoleum, where Miko explains that she's making a new mask. Futo is doubtful.

;''[[Impossible Spell Card]]''
:{{Main|Impossible Spell Card#Story|l1=Impossible Spell Card: Story}}
After apparently reading the newspaper by the [[tengu]] about a mischief-making [[amanojaku]], she becomes one of the many strong [[youkai]] and [[human]]s to try and stop [[Seija Kijin]]. She uses [[spell card]]s that are considered impossible to dodge.

;''[[Urban Legend in Limbo]]''
{{stub|section}}
Futo decides to gather the Occult Balls as her [[Toyosatomimi no Miko|master]] does, but leaving the strong people to Miko. After encountering [[Ichirin Kumoi]] and [[Reimu Hakurei]], Futo defeats [[Fujiwara no Mokou]] and obtains six of the balls. She bumps into [[Byakuren Hijiri]], who claims wanting to prove that the ongoing rumors about the balls are just lies.

;''[[Antinomy of Common Flowers]]''
In ''[[Antinomy of Common Flowers]]'', Futo, alongside [[Ichirin Kumoi]], assists [[Toyosatomimi no Miko]] and [[Byakuren Hijiri]] in their investigation of Perfect Posession. Unlike most tag teams, Futo takes turns with Ichirin at being the master of the posession. After a couple of fights, Futo gets tired and nods off while Ichirin is posessing her, and as a result the two share the same dream in the [[Dream World]].

At sundown when they return to the [[Myouren Temple]], they challenge their leaders for a chance to take over the investigation and vanquish the culprits of the incident themselves.

==Relationships==
===Toyosatomimi no Miko===
Futo has been [[Toyosatomimi no Miko]]'s faithful servant since before the religious war between Shinto and Buddhism. After they died to become shikaisen together and reappeared in [[Gensokyo]], they remain together. ''[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]]'' says that they usually act in unison.

===Soga no Tojiko===
Their official profiles state that Futo and [[Soga no Tojiko]] get along with each other for the most part, despite their origins as enemies in the religious war. They seem to be united under the fact that they both hate Buddhism. In ''[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]]'', it's revealed that the reason Soga is a ghost is because Futo tricked her when they became shikaisen, having held a grudge against her during the religious wars. Soga, however, does not seem to have a problem with being a ghost.

===Other Characters===
;[[Reimu Hakurei]], [[Marisa Kirisame]], [[Sanae Kochiya]] &amp; [[Youmu Konpaku]]
Due to her automatically misunderstanding others, she quickly came to conclusions the first time she met Reimu, Marisa, Sanae and Youmu. For instance: with Reimu, she thought that she has come to be an experimental subject for complete recovery; with Sanae, she thinks Sanae has come to deliver her to [[heaven]]; and with Youmu, she thought she was a [[shikaisen]] (dead nirvana [[hermit]]), and therefore continues to think Youmu is a hermit even after the battle.

| text =　○５面ボス　　古代日本の尸解仙

　　物部 布都（もののべのふと）&lt;br/&gt;
　　Mononobe no Futo

　　種族：人間？（尸解仙を自称する道士）&lt;br/&gt;
　　能力：風水を操る程度の能力


　　ちょっと昔のお話。今から千数百年ほど前だろうか。&lt;br/&gt;
　　まだ国が人を統治するという考え方が纏まりきる前の話。人、物、技術、宗教など様々な物が海を渡って渡来してきた。&lt;br/&gt;
　　その中の一つ、仏教がこの国の行方を大きく変えていく事になる。

　　国は仏教を巡り崇拝派と廃仏派に別れ、お互いの溝を深めていく。神道の神様であるウマシマジノミコトを祖とする物部氏は廃仏派であった。人間を祖とする蘇我氏との対立は凄まじく、この宗教戦争は後に語られるようなただの権力争いではなく、神々の系譜と人間の尊厳との争いだったのである。

　　そして仏教を巡る宗教戦争は悲劇で幕を閉じる。

　　争いは日増しに過激になり、物部氏は寺を襲撃し寺を焼き仏像を捨て廃仏を訴えた。しかしタイミングが悪かったのか、その日から疫病が流行し始め、天皇が崩御してしまう。

　　これを蘇我氏は仏教に大して非道なことをした祟りだと喧伝した。それにより蘇我氏の支持が高まり、ついに物部討伐の許可が下りるのである。

　　その争いで物部は滅亡する事になった。そしてこの国の政治は仏教を中心に行われていくことになる。&lt;br/&gt;
　　これが表に知られている物部、蘇我の宗教戦争である。


　　しかし、実はこれを裏で糸を引く者がいた。それが布都であった。&lt;br/&gt;
　　彼女は物部の姓ながら、影である宗教を崇拝していた。それが仏教と同時に伝わってきた道教である。&lt;br/&gt;
　　道教は自らを超人化する事が出来、その最終目的は不老不死である。権力者にとっては非常に魅力的な宗教であった。

　　だが、この魅力的な宗教も欠点があった。それは民が誰でも修行すれば仙人になれるのでは、政治には向かないと言う事。その為、彼女は道教の事はひた隠しする事になる。

　　そして同じく道教を崇拝していた神子から、ある提案を持ちかけられる。&lt;br/&gt;
　　それが、表向きは民を静かにさせる事の出来る仏教を崇拝しこの国を治める。その上で自分の死に呪いをかけ、我らは尸解仙として復活しよう、という話であった。

　　布都は蘇我氏の味方となり、裏から操る事が出来た。それにより蘇我氏は仏教を盲信するようになった。当然、神の子孫である物部（布都を除く）はそれを面白く思わなかった。


　　その結果、引き起こされたのが仏教を巡る宗教戦争である。実際は、物部という日本古来の神々と、道教を使い新たな神になろうとする神子との争いであった。仏教はその為の目眩ましでしかなかったのだ。


　　しかし、二人の復活まで随分と時間が掛かってしまったようだ。&lt;br/&gt;
　　それは神子の死を不審がった仏教の僧侶達が、その上にお寺を建て復活を拒んでいたからであろう。

　　政治のために利用した仏教であったが、思った以上に信仰力が強く、現代日本まで広く信仰され続けられたのは誤算であったようだ。

&lt;br/&gt;
'''Mononobe no Futo'''

Species: Human? (a taoist who self-identifies as a shikaisen)&lt;br/&gt;
Ability: Manipulating [[wikipedia:Feng shui|feng shui]]


Long ago, indeed, fourteen hundred years ago or so.&lt;br/&gt;
Before, in fact, it had been decided that the country would rule over the people. People, things, technology, religion... Many things were being introduced from across the sea.&lt;br/&gt;
One of those would greatly influence the direction Buddhism would take in this country.

The country was divided into pro- and anti-Buddhist factions, which dug in more over time. The Mononobe, the ones who had Umashimaji no Mikoto - a god in Shinto - as its ancestor, was in the anti-Buddhist faction. Her confrontation with the Soga, the ones who had a human&lt;ref&gt;Academically, the ancestor is thought to be {{nihongo|[[wikipedia:Takenouchi no Sukune|Takenouchi no Sukune]]|武内宿禰}}.&lt;/ref&gt; as its ancestor, was dreadful, and afterwards this religious conflict wasn't talked of as a petty political battle, but as a battle between the lineage of the gods and human dignity.

And so, religious war over Buddhism ended in tragedy.

The battles grew more vicious with each passing day as the Mononobe waged an anti-Buddhist campaign that invaded and burned temples and threw out their statues. Perhaps it was simply bad timing, but after that day, an epidemic began to spread, resulting in the passing of the Emperor.

The Soga proclaimed this to be a curse brought on by despicable acts against Buddhism. This rallied support in Soga's favor, who was eventually given permission to bring the Mononobe into submission.

This battle resulted in the destruction of the Mononobe. From then on, the nation's politics were carried out in a fashion befitting Buddhism.&lt;br/&gt;
This is what most people know about the religious war between the Mononobe and the Soga.


However, there was someone else pulling the strings behind the scenes: Futo.&lt;br/&gt;
A daughter of the Mononobe, she worshipped at the altar of another faith.&lt;br /&gt;
That faith was Taoism, which had been introduced at the same time as Buddhism. Taoism could grant people superhuman abilities based on their own actions, eventually resulting in immortality. It was particularly appealing to those with political power.

However, that appealing faith also had a weakness. It was not well suited for political control, as anyone could undergo the ascetic training necessary to become a hermit. As a result, she decided to practice her Taoism in secret.

Miko, a fellow Taoist practitioner, came to her with a certain plan.&lt;br /&gt;
Her plan was to govern the country using Buddhism as a means to keep the citizenry pacified. Then, they would cast a curse on their own deaths and be reborn as shikaisen.

Futo became an ally of the Soga and was able to manipulate them. Thus, the Soga came to be blind followers of Buddhism.&lt;br /&gt;
Naturally, as descendents of the gods, the Mononobe (excepted Futo) weren't particularly pleased about this.


The result was a protracted religious war over Buddhism. It was, in fact, a war between ancient gods of Japan in name of the Mononobe and Miko, who wished to become a new god through Taoism. Thus Buddhism was only a deception for their plan.


However, it seemed it would take a long time for their resurrection to take place.&lt;br/&gt;
That was probably because a group of Buddhist monks doubted that Miko had actually died, and constructed a large temple above her grave to prevent her from resurrecting.

Buddhism had been used for political ends, but it had apparently been a miscalculation to allow it to become so widely followed that even in modern Japan it continues to be widely observed.

{{nihongo|'''Mugetsu'''|夢月}} is the first Extra Stage boss of ''[[Lotus Land Story]]'' and possibly the creator of a [[Unnamed Dream World|mysterious dream world]]. She appears to be dressed as a [[maid]] of some sort, but according to the music comments of her theme "Illusion of a Maid ~ Icemilk Magic" in ''Lotus Land Story'', she is probably not a maid.

==Character Design==
===Name===
Her name is {{nihongo|''Mugetsu''|夢月}}, which literally means "dreamy moon".

===Design===
In ''[[Lotus Land Story]]'''s official art, Mugetsu has yellow eyes, short yellow hair, and wears a pink and blue maid outfit.

==Appearances==
;''Lotus Land Story''
:{{Main|Lotus Land Story/Story|l1=Lotus Land Story Extra Story}}
After the final events of ''[[Lotus Land Story]]'' the heroine stumbles upon another [[Unnamed Dream World|strange world]] which Mugetsu claims to be her world. Little is known about either her or her sister [[Gengetsu]], and they appear to have no importance to the story, but she is attacked by the heroine out of boredom simply to kill time.

==Relationships==

Mugetsu's only known relationship is with her older sister, [[Gengetsu]].

==Additional Information==
*The final events of ''[[Lotus Land Story]]'' occurred in a "dream world". The place Mugetsu and [[Gengetsu]] reside in appears to be yet another [[Unnamed Dream World|dream world]].
*If Mugetsu was to be classed as a [[maid]], then she is the first maid character to be fought against in the ''[[Touhou Project]]'', preceding both [[Yumeko]] and [[Sakuya Izayoi]]. She would also be the second maid in the series.

{{nihongo|'''Myouren Hijiri'''|聖 命蓮|Hijiri Myouren}} is an enigmatic character, only known to have taught his sister [[Byakuren Hijiri]] Buddhist magic. His death prompted her original fear of death, and her research into magically extending her longevity.

==Background Information==
===Origin===
Myouren is believed to have been a real Buddhist priest. He appears in several stories, but the most significant one is [[Wikipedia:Shigisan-engi|Shigisan-engi]], which is one of the most popular [[wikipedia:Emakimono|emakimono]]. Its third volume involves an unnamed Buddhist priestess worried about her younger brother, Myouren, never returning home, so she seeks out to reunite with him.  While staying at [[Wikipedia:Toudai-ji|Toudai Temple]], where Myouren had made his vows for priesthood, [[Wikipedia:Daibutsu|Daibutsu]] comes to her in a dream with a vision of a purple cloud alongside a mountain southwest from her. She travels there the next morning and finds him there, and they live together.

===Name===
The story simply describes a "Myouren", which is a {{nihongo|[[Wikipedia:Dharma name|dharma name]]|戒名|kaimyou}}, given to a Buddhist priest upon ordination. Through the [[Wikipedia:Heian period|Heian period]] when a priest received their dharma name, they would also drop their family name altogether to remove attachment to worldly life. From the [[Wikipedia:Muromachi period|Muromachi period]] (~1500) forward priests would retain their family names upon ordination. Since "Myouren" lived around the middle of the Heian period, between 850-950, he wouldn't have referred to himself as "Myouren" with a family name.

===Design===
No official art of Myouren exists, however [[ZUN]] has said that he thought of him as an old man, matching his appearance in the Shigisan-engi.

==Relationships==
{{stub|section}}
;[[Byakuren Hijiri]] (Older sister)

==Additional Information==
*In an interview with [[ZUN]], he states that Myouren was originally meant to be the final [[boss]] of ''[[Undefined Fantastic Object]]'', but he decided against it because "It would be weird to have an old man as the last boss in Touhou".
*His age at the time of death is unknown, but Myouren is thought to have lived in the late 9th to 10th century around 900 C.E. As shown in the Shigisan-engi, he is thought to have lived to old age, coinciding with the original image ZUN had of him. 
*He lived the majority of his known life in what is now known as [[Wikipedia:Nara Prefecture|Nara Prefecture]], but is thought to have been born in [[Wikipedia:Shinano Province|Shinano Province]], or current day [[Wikipedia:Nagano Prefecture|Nagano]], ZUN's home. First taking his vows at {{nihongo|[[Wikipedia:Tōdai-ji|Toudai Temple]]|東大寺}}, he later trained at {{nihongo|[[Wikipedia:Chōgosonshi-ji|Chougosonshi Temple]]|朝護孫子寺}}, originally founded by [[Wikipedia:Prince Shōtoku|Prince Shoutoku]], on {{nihongo|[[Wikipedia:Mount Shigi|Mount Shigi]]|信貴山}}. It was here where Myouren's elder sister later reunited with him.
**Chougosonshi Temple is a head temple of Shigisan Shingon Buddhism, one of the sects of [[w:Shingon Buddhism|Shingon Buddhism]].

{{nihongo|'''Mystia Lorelei'''|ミスティア・ローレライ|Misutia Roorerai}} is a [[night sparrow]] with an outgoing egocentric personality, at least she sounds arrogant, that enjoys infusing confusion and terror into the hearts of [[human]]s using her ability: a song that creates confusion in those who hear her. Her song seems to attract nearby monsters as well. She roams the [[Youkai Trail]] near the [[Human Village]] that [[Keine Kamishirasawa]] tries to protect, in search of humans to frighten. She is indeed feared by the locals as people around her become blinded by darkness. Some time later, along with [[Kyouko Kasodani]], they formed a duo combination called [[Choujuu Gigaku]].

==General Information==
===Personality===
Mystia's known to be a birdbrain with a short attention span and very prone to forgetfulness. She loves singing, but because of her ability to drive people mad by singing, many find her mere existence annoying. In most of her appearances, she is driven to attack humans much like any other youkai. She doesn't like being interrupted while she is singing &lt;ref name="BAiJR"&gt; ''[[Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red/Mystia#Interview|Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red]]'' - Mystia's Interview &lt;/ref&gt;, and she hates when other people continue her songs &lt;ref&gt; ''[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View/Story/Mystia's Scenario#Mystia vs. Yuuka (Episode 8)|Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]'' - Mystia's Scenario (Dialogue with [[Yuuka Kazami]]) &lt;/ref&gt;.

Despite all of her faults, Mystia displays a wide variety of hidden depths for someone of her simplicity. She's a great cook who owns a successful grilled lamprey stand and is knowledgeable about making sake. Mystia's also surprisingly conniving, using her abilities to attract and con travellers into buying her meals. She is a part of a punk rock band with Kyouko where she plays the guitar.

===Abilities===
;Ability to bewilder or drive people insane by singing
It is an ability to dull and weaken people's ability to make judgments through her singing voice. Despite that, since she pretty much only sings, her existence is an annoyance to others. &lt;!--Her sense of lyrics rivals that of the infamous.--&gt; The true worth of this ability is unclear, but as [[Yuuka Kazami]] said, it "isn't coming from inside you, but rather you're singing a song you're hearing from a faint voice" and as [[Eiki Shiki, Yamaxanadu]] said, "if you continue singing without thinking, the souls around you will become more than strange." Therefore, Eiki concluded, "that may be connected to an unprecedented grave sin." By Eiki's judgement, it seems like Mystia herself does not understand the power of her own songs.

;Ability to inflict blindness to [[human]]s
Something that [[Night Sparrow]] also possess in real legends, it is an ability to inflict night-blindness on the opponent. Unlike the aforementioned song whose details are unknown, in the game she exercises this ability to her heart's content. Thanks to this, in battle time, nothing but the player's surroundings can be seen and in the last spell, it becomes somewhat difficult to know what kind of [[danmaku]] it is. Incidentally, unlike [[Rumia]]'s darkness, since it is always merely an ability to make the darkness unable to be seen through, it can be of no use at all during daytime.

; Ability to rule winged insects
Although it is unknown how she does it, it is an ability to rule and subdue moths, sparrows, and countless other birds &amp; insects. In the game, this can be seen in the form of [[spell card]]s and [[danmaku]]. At night, she mainly uses winged insects, and at day, mainly birds. She even used several hundred birds to restore the legendary sake.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oriental Sacred Place]]'', Chapter 13&lt;/ref&gt;

===Occupation===
Mystia usually spends the day in hiding and attacking humans at night, luring them with her songs. &lt;ref&gt; ''[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View/Story/Mystia's Scenario#Mystia vs. Cirno (Episode 1)|Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]'' - Mystia's Scenario: ''"My songs are meant to lure humans!"'' &lt;/ref&gt; However, Mystia is shown to have multiple hobbies as well. 

;Grilled Lamprey Stand
She hates Yakitori (grilled chicken on sticks) because she is a kind of bird. So she started a grilled lamprey stand instead of a Yakitori stand. (It was believed that lampreys had eight eyes and can cure night blindness.) She uses this as part of a con-act: she will travel with her stand at night, use her power to make unwary travellers night-blind, then sell them grilled lamprey, and slowly remove the effect as they eat it, claiming that the lamprey was what cured them &lt;ref name="BAiJRI"&gt; ''[[Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red/Mystia#Article|Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red]]'' - Mystia's Article &lt;/ref&gt;. Mystia's also capable of making delicious sake. 

;Choujuu Gigaku
Mystia along with Kyouko formed a punk rock band where they play rock music at night. It's popular with youkai and fairies. &lt;ref name="SoPM"&gt; ''[[Symposium of Post-mysticism/Bunbunmaru Newspaper 1|Symposium of Post-mysticism]]'' - Kyouko and Mystia's Article &lt;/ref&gt;

==Character Design==
[[File:PMiSS mystia.jpg|160px|thumb|Mystia, as illustrated in ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'']]
{{stub|section}}
===Name===
Her full name is {{nihongo|''Mystia Lorelei''|ミスティア・ローレライ}}. The "Lorelei" part of her name most likely is a reference to a German poem about the siren [[wikipedia:Lorelei|Lorelei]], that also had a mesmerizing song.

===Design===
Mystia is shown to have grey eyes and pink hair. She has pointed ears like an owl and light pink bird-like wings with purple highlights. She is dresses in white and brown clothing, where her hat and dress contain numerous bird-shaped ornaments. She also has long fingernails in Imperishable Night which was colored similarly to her outfit (which was light brown). However her fingernails was green in Phantasmagoria of Flower View.

Her alternative outfit in ''[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]'' the same, except her clothes are green, and her wings have red highlights.

==Appearances==
===Games===
;''Imperishable Night''
[[File:Th08MystiaSprite.png|frame|Mystia's sprite in ''IN'']]
:{{Main|Imperishable Night/Story/Boundary Team's Scenario 1#Stage 2|l1=Boundary Team's Scenario }}
Mystia calls out to Reimu &amp; Yukari to wait for her to catch up. When she approaches them, she wonders if they are good humans to eat. However, Yukari tells her she is mistaken, as they are a pair of non-humans in a hurry. Mystia muses that humans usually are not seen on the night road, and Yukari demands for the pair's passage, for there was no time to waste. Reimu chimes in, the end of the road isn't a place where youkai gather and ever so persistent, Mystia asks them if they would accompany her to mess with the human village. Reimu gets upset and the two fight.
:{{Main|Imperishable Night/Story/Magic Team's Scenario 1#Stage 2|l1=Magic Team's Scenario }}
Mystia interrupts Marisa &amp; Alice's journey and asks where they are going. Marisa responds that it is her annual Youkai Extermination Month. Mystia agitated, asks if she was picking a fight with her. Marisa scoffs, exclaiming that there is no one, human or youkai, that can stand against her magicannon. Mystia counters with that there are no humans that do no fear her, for she could summon enough Youkai to destroy all humankind. Alice is perturbed, and asks just what Mystia is playing at. Haughtily, Marisa laughs and tells Mystia she doesn't know who she is dealing with. Alice, slightly undermining Marisa, adds; "A Human." Fired up from the boasting, Mystia exclaims they will never be able to see in the dark again, and the two clash.
:{{Main|Imperishable Night/Story/Scarlet Team's Scenario 1#Stage 2|l1=Scarlet Team's Scenario }}
Mystia flags down Remilia &amp; Sakuya, the two rushing down the path. Sakuya informs her that if she can keep up with them, the duo will listen. The night sparrow remarks the pair as a human and a bat; telling them she is only interested in Sakuya. Remilia, indignant mutters "Hmph. Is it the brats' night out?" to which Mystia interjects "Naturally! The good little children went to bed at noon.  "At night, it's happy hour for man-hunting!" Retorting, Remilia tells her that they are in a hurry and she needs to get out of their way, or she will get shot down. Mystia pleads for them to wait, while Sakuya suggests to Remilia to avoid picking a fight with her because they will find themselves fighting endlessly of other youkai her level. Mystia feeling scorned, tells them to stop joking and asks if they are afraid of birds flying in the night. Remilia remarks that frying birds is not as good as humans are; Sakuya chastising that she can't use fry in place of fly. Annoyed, Mystia prepares to fight Team Scarlet, exclaiming "I'll show you the true terror of darkness!".
:{{Main|Imperishable Night/Story/Ghost Team's Scenario 1#Stage 2|l1=Ghost Team's Scenario}}
Mystia stops the pair from going down the road, demanding to know why her song is not affecting them and wonders aloud if they are even human. Yuyuko muses that it is nighttime, but yet a sparrow is singing. Youmu tells her to not pay attention to her accursed song, and Mystia argues back that at least her singing is better than the sound of phantoms. Yuyuko thinks she has a point, much to her subordinate's dismay. She exclaims the sounds have gotten louder, and Mystia annoyed tells Team Netherworld that it does not matter if they are human or not, the festival of youkai has begin. Yuyuko bored, asks Youmu if they should hurry along and she agree, but figures they need to shoot the sparrow standing before them. Yuyuko mutters she doesn't like sparrows, for they are too bony and Mystia prepares to fight which she cries out "You shall not pass!"
;''Phantasmagoria of Flower View''
[[File:Th09MystiaBackSprite.png|frame|left|Mystia's back sprite in ''PoFV'']]
{{Main|Phantasmagoria_of_Flower_View/Story#Mystia.27s_Story|l1=Phantasmagoria of Flower View Story}}
During the events of ''[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]'', Mystia aimlessly wanders around singing, hoping to catch and eat humans attracted by the flowers. Instead, she attracts (or rather, annoys) the other protagonists and ends up fighting each in turn.

===Spin-offs===
;''Hopeless Masquerade''
[[File:Th135Mystia.png|frame|Mystia in ''HM'']]
Mystia made a background cameo appearance in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'' on the [[Hall of Dreams' Great Mausoleum]] stage. She is seen sitting high on the mausoleum whilst cheering something.

===Literature===
;''Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red''
{{Main|Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red/Mystia|l1=Article and Interview: Mystia}}
Instead of the Yakitoki stand, Mystia decided to make one of grilled lamprey eels. Lampreys are better for night vision and night blindness and, as Mystia is the one who ''causes'' the night blindness, the humans are slightly pressured to eat her lampreys. She also sings while they eat, so her effects are not appreciated. However, the lampreys don’t have that counter effect or they don’t act so quickly, Mystia only removes the effects and pretends the food did it.

Mystia doesn't show any interest on her article when asked, and just kept singing, to [[Aya Shameimaru]] annoyance. Aya claimed that she disliked Mystia’s tricks to attract customers, but she agreed that the food was very good and that the grilled lampreys were underrated. 

;''Oriental Sacred Place''
[[Reimu Hakurei]] and [[Marisa Kirisame]] agreed to go to Mystia’s stand to eat and drink, and after doing so they were so good humored that the [[Three Fairies of Light]] got very confused and curious. They decide to ask the sparrow directly, but Mystia doesn’t understand them and the fairies just eat and drink there as the humans did before, while Mystia explains the history of her sake, one made by sparrows that dropped rice to honor their ancestors.

;''Symposium of Post-mysticism''
{{Main|Symposium of Post-mysticism/Bunbunmaru Newspaper 1|l1=Mystia and Kyouko Article}}
[[Aya Shameimaru]] covers the concerts at the middle of the night of a group called "Choujuu Gigaku", formed by [[Kyouko Kasodani]] and Mystia. From her point of view, they are concerts where they "perform off-key music while shouting rebellious lyrics" known as new genre called "punk". Aya, after investing the lyrics of the songs, says that maybe they are just venting about what annoys them, but she hopes there are no real incidents.
==Relationships==
===Kyouko Kasodani===
Mystia and [[Kyouko Kasodani]] form a band called "[[Choujuu Gigaku]]". Kyouko has also been seen assisting Mystia with her stall.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'', Chapter 20&lt;/ref&gt;

==Additional Information==
*Mystia's self-confidence makes her one of the few enemies that attacks as a midboss but does not run away to recover when defeated the first time. Other characters who also do not run away after defeat are [[Yuugi Hoshiguma]] and [[Nemuno Sakata]]. Unlike Yuugi that lingers arund during the rest of the stage, however, Mystia and Nemuno immediately launch into another attack.
*She was featured on the cover of the ''[[Imperishable Night]]'' "trial plus" disc.
*Mystia, along with the [[Prismriver Sisters]] and [[Yuuka Kazami]], are the only [[Windows]]-era-[[spell-card]]-capable characters not to appear in ''[[Shoot the Bullet]]''.
*From ''[[Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red]]'', Mystia says that she cannot read the tiny letters on the newspaper. Aya takes this as Mystia admitting that she cannot read. In ''[[Oriental Sacred Place]]'' Chapter 13, Mystia is shown to have the ability to read but somewhat struggles in it.

Stage 2 boss. A Night Sparrow.
She possesses ability to drive people insane by singing

Seeing as humans have only heard her cry, her true form is unknown.
From her cry she's called a sparrow, but it's hard to say if she is actually a sparrow.
As humans don't know her form, they fear her, and it's unclear what they would think if they saw her.

She's known to give humans night-blindness (an illness where one's eyesight degenerates a lot in dark places) to hide her form.

| translation = '''Stage 2 Boss, Night Sparrow Apparition'''

'''Mystia Lorelei'''

Species: [[Night Sparrow]]&lt;br/&gt;
Abilities: Driving people insane by singing

Stage 2 Boss.

In addition to her song of confusion, she can make people night-blind.

[[Human]]s call her the [[Night Sparrow]], but few have ever seen her appearance.  This is because she only plays during nighttime, and humans around her become blinded by darkness anyway.  Had they seen what she actually looks like, they probably wouldn't have called her a sparrow.

Her song can cloud a person's judgment; humans who walk into the night in that condition inevitably disappear without a trace.  This confusion ability is the main reason people lose their way at night so easily.

In addition, she's known to give humans night-blindness (an illness where one's eyesight degenerates a lot in dark places) to hide her form.

{{nihongo|'''Narumi Yatadera'''|矢田寺  成美| ''Yatadera Narumi''}} is a [[:wikipedia:Kshitigarbha|Jizo]] statue that came to life as a [[magician]] youkai due to the [[Forest of Magic]]'s energy.

==General Information==
Narumi appeared as the Stage 4 [[Boss]] in ''[[Hidden Star in Four Seasons]]''.

===Personality===
Narumi is shy and withdrawn. Upon meeting her, Marisa Kirisame, who apparently already knew her, describes her as a "shut-in introvert." &lt;ref&gt; ''[[Hidden Star in Four Seasons]]'' - [[Hidden Star in Four Seasons/Story/Marisa's Scenario|Marisa]] Scenario &lt;/ref&gt; The Four Seasons Incident lured her out of hiding, as well as others who are otherwise solitary, and awakened her desire to fight. After being defeated, she loses her courage and is startled when a back door appears on her back. Although she lives solitary, she has some contact with Marisa and helps her make a plan against Okina Matara to avoid her trap.

===Abilities===
;Capable of using magic (control of life)
She can use magic and control life, as she embodies salvation through Buddha. According to her own statements, she can completely erase fairies that are made of life force; however, this has not been seen before and it is unlikely that Narumi would use this power.

==Backstory==
She was initially just an ordinary stone statue in the form of the Buddha. The magic in the forest eventually breathed life into her, &lt;ref&gt; ''[[Hidden Star in Four Seasons]]'' - Narumi's omake &lt;/ref&gt; unlike Aunn Komano, who was a stone statue with consciousness and only gained a humanoid form through [[Okina Matara]] at the beginning of the incident.

==Character Design==
===Origin===
Narumi's snow-covered, hatted appearance is based on the popular folk tale of the hatted Jizo statue, wherein a poor man heads out to sell cloth on New Year's Eve, but notices a man selling five straw hats out-of-season. Taking pity on him, the poor man exchanges the cloth for the hats. On the way home, the man notices six Jizo statues sitting out in the cold. He decides to cover each one with one of the hats, and to the sixth, gives his own. He goes home empty-handed, but is visited by the six Jizo the next evening who reward him for his generosity.

===Name===
Her full name is Narumi Yatadera (矢田寺  成美). The kanji of 'Narumi' means 'to become/attain/grow into', referencing her magical transformation from a statue, and 'beauty', respectively. Her first name could therefore mean something along the lines of 'attaining beauty'. Yatadera is a buddhist temple in Yamatokoriyama, Nara Prefecture, which is known for its [[jizou]] statues and in particular for housing the oldest jizou statue in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yatadera.or.jp/languages/en.html Yatadera Temple] website&lt;/ref&gt;

===Design===
Narumi has black hair in two long braids, dark brown eyes, and long earlobes typical of Jizo statues. She wears a long gray dress with a stone texture, with red circular buttons on the front, and a red capelet covering her left shoulder. She wears black sandals with red socks, and has a frilly, snow-covered conical straw hat.

The capelet and hat are both items Jizo statues are typically adorned with to convey gratitude or to ward off evil. The capelet has the phrase ''"hikkyō jōbutsu"'' ({{lang|ja|畢竟成佛}}, meaning 'ultimate attainment of Buddhahood') written on it. The text on her hat is taken from a poem, and while partially obscured by the snow, it reads {{lang|ja|「迷故三界城　悟故十方空　本來無東西　何處有南北 」}}, which roughly translates to &lt;i&gt;'Bewilderment [is akin to being lost] in the City of Three Realms. Enlightenment [is as if there] is emptiness in ten directions. Originally there was no East or West, so where do South and North exist?'&lt;/i&gt;.

The hat, including the poem text, is part of a traditional uniform for pilgrims undergoing the [[:wikipedia:Shikoku Pilgrimage|Shikoku Pilgrimage]], a 1000 km route of 88 temples associated with the Buddhist monk [[:wikipedia:Kūkai|Kōbō-Daishi]]. It was a dangerous journey, and pilgrims embarked on it aware of the possibility they may die. The poem on the hat was traditionally written on the coffins of priests, so by writing them on the hat, it could serve as their casket if they were to die.

==Appearances==
===Games===
;''Hidden Star in Four Seasons''
[[File:Th16NarumiSprite.png|frame|Narumi's sprite in ''HSiFS'']]
Narumi meets the protagonist in the snowy forest of magic. She is so full of the desire to fight that she does not notice [[Satono Nishida]], who disappears into the land of back doors through a back door in Narumi's back. After the fight, the protagonists point out the door on her back, whereupon, confused, she lets the protagonist pass through. Only in Cirno's scenario does the door appear on the protagonists back.

In [[Marisa]]'s ending, Marisa speaks with her about what she found in her back and in the [[Land of the Backdoor]]. After Narumi asks her if everything will go back to normal now, Marisa couldn't say for sure.

===Literature===
;''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]''
Narumi makes only a brief appearance when [[Aunn Komano]] and [[Marisa Kirisame]] discuss the incident in ''[[Hidden Star in Four Seasons]]''.
;''[[Visionary Fairies in Shrine]]''
Again, only talked about, in this case by the [[fairy]]s.
;''[[Curiosities of Lotus Asia]]''
In chapter 31, Narumi arrives at [[Kourindou]] meanwhile [[Rinnosuke Morichika]], [[Marisa Kirisame]] and [[Sumireko Usami]] were talking about the climate and the incident Marisa solved. After asking who was Sumireko and if she was in sale, all of them start talking. Marisa then starts saying exactly what the incident was about and about the [[Okina Matara|secret god]], to Rinnosuke's surprise.

==Relationships==
===Minor Relationships===
;[[Marisa Kirisame]]
Narumi and Marisa knew each other before the events of [[Hidden Star in Four Seasons]], and are on friendly terms.
[[Strange Creators of Outer World/Hidden Star in Four Seasons Interview with ZUN|According to ZUN]], Marisa's quote about Alice putting hats on statues before her fight against Reimu in ''[[Imperishable Night]]'' was a hint to this (although ZUN might not have been serious).

==Additional Information==
*In Hidden Star in Four Seasons, she is also referred to as Naruko (成子), such as during Marisa's scenario as well as in the upper-left corner of the screen when fought as a boss. [[Strange Creators of Outer World/Hidden Star in Four Seasons Interview with ZUN|According to ZUN]], Naruko was her original name and made it into the game originally (hence why it's still in some areas) but he later changed it to Narumi, partly because too many characters had names ending with 'ko'.

Species: Magician (Jizo)&lt;br /&gt;
Ability: Capable of using magic (control of life)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

A living creature who used to be a jizo statue in the Forest of Magic, but gained life from the forest's magic power.&lt;br /&gt;
She was troubled by the Forest's unseasonable snowfall, but she was a stay-at-home kind of person to begin with, so she didn't bother to leave the forest and investigate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

The Forest of Magic has the power to change the very nature of the beings within it.&lt;br /&gt;
She may be a "Jizo," but she's not the Jizo Bodhisattva or anything; she started off as just a stone jizo statue.&lt;br /&gt;
Since she's a stone statue that gained a life of its own, she's somewhat like a golem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Because she's sensitive to magic, she noticed that an abnormal magic power was flowing forth from her own back.&lt;br /&gt;
However, she thought that it was due to the influence of the Four Seasons Incident; she had no idea that her own power&lt;br /&gt;
was causing part of said incident in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

She's also the one who, after hearing about Okina from Marisa, came up with a secret counter-strategy to entrust Marisa with.

{{nihongo|'''Mystia Lorelei'''|ミスティア・ローレライ|Misutia rourerai}} is a [[night sparrow]] with an outgoing egocentric personality - at least she sounds arrogant - that enjoys infusing confusion and terror into the hearts of [[human]]s using her ability: a song that creates confusion in those who hear her. Her song seems to attract nearby monsters as well. She roams a road near the [[Human Village]] that [[Keine Kamishirasawa]] tries to protect, in search of humans to frighten. She is indeed feared by the locals as people around her become blinded by darkness. Some time later, along with [[Kyouko Kasodani]], formed a duo combination called [[Choujuu Gigaku]].

==General Information==
===Ability===
;Ability to bewilder or drive people insane by singing
It is an ability to dull and weaken people's ability to make judgments through her singing voice. Despite that, since she pretty much only sings, her existence is an annoyance to others. &lt;!--Her sense of lyrics rivals that of the infamous.--&gt; The true worth of this ability is unclear, but as [[Yuuka Kazami]] said, it "isn't coming from inside you, but rather you're singing a song you're hearing from a faint voice," and as [[Eiki Shiki, Yamaxanadu]] said, "if you continue singing without thinking, the souls around you will become more than strange." Therefore, Eiki concluded, "that may be connected to an unprecedented grave sin." By Eiki's judgement, it seems like Mystia herself does not understand the power of her own songs.

;Ability to inflict blindness to [[human]]s
Something that [[Night Sparrow]] also possess in real legends, it is an ability to inflict night-blindness on the opponent. Unlike the aforementioned song whose details are unknown, in the game she exercises this ability to her heart's content. Thanks to this, in battle time, nothing but the player's surroundings can be seen, and in the last spell, it becomes somewhat difficult to know what kind of [[danmaku]] it is. Incidentally, unlike [[Rumia]]'s darkness, since it is always merely an ability to make the darkness unable to be seen through, it can be of no use at all during daytime.

;King of winged insects
Although it is unknown how she does it, it is an ability to rule and subdue moths, sparrows, and countless other birds &amp; insects. In the game, this can be seen in the form of [[spell card]]s and [[danmaku]]. At night, she mainly uses winged insects, and at day, mainly birds. She even used several hundred birds to restore the legendary sake.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oriental Sacred Place]]'', Chapter 13&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character Basis==
[[File:PMiSS mystia.jpg|thumb|Mystia, as illustrated in ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'']]
{{stub|section}}
===Name===
Her full name is {{nihongo|''Mystia Lorelei''|ミスティア・ローレライ}}. The "Lorelei" part of her name most likely is a reference to a German poem about the siren [[wikipedia:Lorelei|Lorelei]], that also had a mesmerizing song.

===Design===
Mystia is shown to have grey eyes and pink hair. She has pointed ears like an owl and light pink bird-like wings with purple highlights. She is dresses in white and brown clothing, where her hat and dress contain numerous bird-shaped ornaments. 

Her alternative outfit in ''[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]'' the same, except her clothes are green, and her wings have red highlights. 

==Story==
===Games===
;''Imperishable Night''
:{{Main|Imperishable Night/Story/Boundary Team's Scenario 1#Stage 2|l1=Boundary Team's Scenario }}
Mystia calls out to Reimu &amp; Yukari to wait for her to catch up. When she approaches them, she wonders if they are good humans to eat. However, Yukari tells her she is mistaken, as they are a pair of non-humans in a hurry. Mystia muses that humans usually are not seen on the night road, and Yukari demands for the pair's passage, for there was no time to waste. Reimu chimes in, the end of the road isn't a place where youkai gather and ever so persistent, Mystia asks them if they would accompany her to mess with the human village. Reimu gets upset and the two fight.
:{{Main|Imperishable Night/Story/Magic Team's Scenario 1#Stage 2|l1=Magic Team's Scenario }}
Mystia interrupts Marisa &amp; Alice's journey and asks where they are going. Marisa responds that it is her annual Youkai Extermination Month. Mystia agitated, asks if she was picking a fight with her. Marisa scoffs, exclaiming that there is no one, human or youkai, that can stand against her magicannon. Mystia counters with that there are no humans that do no fear her, for she could summon enough Youkai to destroy all humankind. Alice, perturbed asks just what Mystia is playing at. Haughtily, Marisa laughs and tells her she doesn't know who she is dealing with. Alice, slightly undermining Marisa, adds in "A Human". Fired up from the boasting, Mystia exclaims they will never be able to see in the dark again, and the two clash.
:{{Main|Imperishable Night/Story/Scarlet Team's Scenario 1#Stage 2|l1=Scarlet Team's Scenario }}
Mystia flags down Remilia &amp; Sakuya, the two rushing down the path. Sakuya informs her that if she can keep up with them, the duo will listen. The night sparrow remarks the pair as a human and a bat; telling them she is only interested in Sakuya. Remilia, indignant mutters "Hmph. Is it the brats' night out?" to which Mystia interjects "Naturally! The good little children went to bed at noon.  "At night, it's happy hour for man-hunting!" Retorting, Remilia tells her that they are in a hurry and she needs to get out of their way, or she will get shot down. Mystia pleads for them to wait, while Sakuya suggests to Remilia to avoid picking a fight with her because they will find themselves fighting endlessly of other youkai her level. Mystia feeling scorned, tells them to stop joking and asks if they are afraid of birds flying in the night. Remilia remarks that frying birds is not as good as humans are; Sakuya chastising that she can't use fry in place of fly. Annoyed, Mystia prepares to fight Team Scarlet, exclaiming "I'll show you the true terror of darkness!".
:{{Main|Imperishable Night/Story/Ghost Team's Scenario 1#Stage 2|l1=Ghost Team's Scenario}}
Mystia stops the pair from going down the road, demanding to know why her song is not affecting them and wonders aloud if they are even human. Yuyuko muses that it is nighttime, but yet a sparrow is singing. Youmu tells her to not pay attention to her accursed song, and Mystia argues back that at least her singing is better than the sound of phantoms. Yuyuko thinks she has a point, much to her subordinate's dismay. She exclaims the sounds have gotten louder, and Mystia annoyed tells Team Netherworld that it does not matter if they are human or not, the festival of youkai has begin. Yuyuko bored, asks Youmu if they should hurry along and she agree, but figures they need to shoot the sparrow standing before them. Yuyuko mutters she doesn't like sparrows, for they are too bony and Mystia prepares to fight which she cries out "You shall not pass!"
;''Phantasmagoria of Flower View''
{{Main|Phantasmagoria_of_Flower_View/Story#Mystia.27s_Story|l1=Phantasmagoria of Flower View Story}}
During the events of ''[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]'', Mystia aimlessly wanders around singing, hoping to catch and eat humans attracted by the flowers. Instead, she attracts (or rather, annoys) the other protagonists and ends up fighting each in turn.

===Spin-offs===
;''Hopeless Masquerade''
[[File:Th135Mystia.png|frame|Mystia in ''HM'']]
Mystia made a background cameo appearance in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'' on the [[Hall of Dreams' Great Mausoleum]] stage. She is seen sitting high on the mausoleum whilst cheering something.

==Relationships==
===Kyouko Kasodani===
Mystia and [[Kyouko Kasodani]] form a band called "[[Choujuu Gigaku]]". Kyouko has also been seen assisting Mystia with her stall.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'', Chapter 20&lt;/ref&gt;

==Additional Information==
*Mystia's self-confidence makes her one of the only enemies that attacks as a midboss but does not run away to recover when defeated the first time, while another character who also does not run away after defeat is [[Yuugi Hoshiguma]]. Instead, Mystia immediately launches into another attack, firmly believing that she will win.
*She was featured on the cover of the ''[[Imperishable Night]]'' "trial plus" disc.
*Mystia, along with the [[Prismriver Sisters]] and [[Yuuka Kazami]], are the only [[Windows]]-era-[[spell-card]]-capable characters not to appear in ''[[Shoot the Bullet]]''.
*She hates Yakitori (grilled chicken on sticks) because she is a kind of bird. So she started a grilled lamprey stand instead of a Yakitori stand. (It was believed that lampreys had eight eyes and are able to cure night blindness.) She uses this as part of a con-act: she will travel with her stand at night, use her power to make unwary travelers night-blind, then sell them grilled lamprey, and slowly remove the effect as they eat it, claiming that the lamprey was what cured them.
*Mystia is also apparently a skillful cook, since even Aya concedes that her grilled lampreys taste good.
*From ''[[Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red]]'', Mystia says that she cannot read the tiny letters on the newspaper. Aya takes this as Mystia admitting that she cannot read. In ''[[Oriental Sacred Place]]'' Chapter 13, Mystia is shown to have the ability to read but somewhat struggles in it.

Stage 2 boss. A Night Sparrow.
She possesses ability to drive people insane by singing

Seeing as humans have only heard her cry, her true form is unknown.
From her cry she's called a sparrow, but it's hard to say if she is actually a sparrow.
As humans don't know her form, they fear her, and it's unclear what they would think if they saw her.

She's known to give humans night-blindness (an illness where one's eyesight degenerates a lot in dark places) to hide her form.

| translation = '''Stage 2 Boss, Night Sparrow'''

'''Mystia Lorelei'''

Species: [[Night Sparrow]]&lt;br/&gt;
Abilities: Driving people insane by singing

Stage 2 Boss.

In addition to her song of confusion, she can make people night-blind.

[[Human]]s call her the [[Night Sparrow]], but few have ever seen her appearance.  This is because she only plays during nighttime, and humans around her become blinded by darkness anyway.  Had they seen what she actually looks like, they probably wouldn't have called her a sparrow.

Her song can cloud a person's judgment; humans who walk into the night in that condition inevitably disappear without a trace.  This confusion ability is the main reason people lose their way at night so easily.

She can also make people night-blind in order to hide better within the darkness.

{{nihongo|'''Nazrin'''|ナズーリン|Nazūrin}} is a [[mouse]] [[youkai]] who's a skilled dowser and the leader of a great number of mice. As the leader of many mice, she often employs them to search for things for her; though if she were to ask them to find food, it would most likely be gone by the time they returned.

==General Information==
Nazrin first appeared as the [[stage]] 1 [[boss]] of ''[[Undefined Fantastic Object]]'' and later appeared as the stage 5 midboss. She was a target on Stage 7 in ''[[Double Spoiler]]'' and made a background appearance in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]''.

===Personality===
''[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]]'' describes Nazrin as having a large ego – due to being backed by [[Bishamonten]] himself – but that she is also timid, and would run away as soon as she became frightened. She also apparently eats quite a bit, and depending on how many mice are under her command at a given time, can put a serious dent in crop numbers.

''Symposium of Post-mysticism'' also mentions that if one is firm and holds their ground while negotiating with her, they can get her to search for lost objects for them - while on the other hand, asking humbly and politely is likely only to inflate her ego.

Throughout the events of ''[[Undefined Fantastic Object]]'' she is quite straightforward in speech.

===Abilities===
;Finding sought-for items
As stated, Nazrin's ability is being able to find specific objects that are being looked for by someone. In order to effectively utilize the ability, she must have a clear, concrete image of what she is looking for.
===Possessions===
; Dowsing Rods 
She presumably uses a pair of [[wikipedia:Dowsing rod|dowsing rods]] to aid her in this effort, which she uses to find gold and treasure, and also is able to order the mice under her command to assist her. The mouse and the [[wikipedia:Dowsing rod|dowsing rods]], freely using a pendulum, perform dowsing. It seems like the rod and the pendulum are utilised in battle, and are used as a shield and as a tool for firing [[danmaku]]. Furthermore, each end of the dowsing rods appears to have a letter. The left one has N (north) and W (west), while the right one has S (south) and E (east). Nazrin owns a pair of [[wikipedia:Dowsing rod|dowsing rods]], which she uses to find gold and treasure. She employs the rods in ''[[Undefined Fantastic Object]]'' to search for the lost pagoda of [[Bishamonten]], as well as the fragments of the Flying Storehouse.

The origin of this is probably due to a legend where a trial was ordered for [[wikipedia:Ōkuninushi|Ookuninushi]] to marry Suserihime. There, a mouse came back with an arrow that Ookuninushi was searching for. However, for the method to be due to dowsing is not quite accurate, and the standard of searching at that time is unclear. Furthermore, as the ability itself is always ancillary, in the end, she searches at her feet. It also seems like for the sought-for food items, they are devoured by the mice before the food can come to hand.

===Occupation===
Nazrin acts as [[Shou Toramaru]]'s faithful helper, but is also the leader of a great deal of ordinary mice. In ''Symposium of Post-mysticism'', she is referred to as Shou's mouse familiar, but in reality she is a high-ranking youkai dispatched by Bishamonten. Because of this, she does not generally reside at the [[Myouren Temple]], and will not visit unless Shou calls upon her.

She currently resides in a small self-built hut in [[Muenzuka]], because of the treasure that floats in from the outside world.

==Backstory==
Nazrin is a high-ranking youkai dispatched by the god [[Bishamonten]]. She was sent to god's new disciple, [[Shou Toramaru]], to be a helper and also to keep an eye on her.

==Character Design==
[[File:ThGKNazrin.png|thumb|right|200px|Nazrin as depicted in ''[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]]'']]
===Name===
Her only known name is {{nihongo|''Nazrin''|ナズーリン}}, which could be a reference to {{nihongo||鼠|nezumi}}, the Japanese word for "mouse". Her name could also be derived from [[wikipedia:Nasrin (name)|the Persian name ''Nasrin'']] ({{lang|fa|نسرین}}) with the meaning "wild rose", a widely used name in the Islamic world; various different spellings include ''Nasrin'', ''Nazrin'' and ''Nesrin''. There's also "Nasulin" ({{lang|ru|Насулин}}), a real Russian surname, and it's also the name of a nasal insulin. In the data files for ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'', her name was romanised as "nazu-rin".

[[ZUN]] states in an interview that it made sense to have a mouse be the envoy of the Bishamonten; in the Chinese zodiac, the mouse represents north, as does Bishamonten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otIrJdoaITI|title=Interview with Chara☆Mel|access-date=9 March 2011|author=Chara☆Mel|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Design===
Nazrin has gray hair and red eyes. She wears a brownish-black one-piece with pink sleeves and a gray capelet. She also wears a necklace with a crystal pendant. Carries dowsing rods with the letters for the cardinal directions on the ends. She also carries a mouse in a basket by her tail. When she appears as the Stage 5 midboss, she is carrying the jeweled pagoda of [[Bishamonten]].

==Appearances==
[[File:Th12Nazrin2.png‎|thumb|right|150px|Nazrin, as seen in Stage 5]]
===Games===
;''Undefined Fantastic Object''
[[File:Th12NazrimSprite.png|frame|Nazrin's sprite in ''UFO'']]
She was asked by [[Shou Toramaru]] to look for the lost pagoda of [[Bishamonten]]. On Stage 1 of ''Undefined Fantastic Object'', Nazrin descends from the flying ship after getting a treasure reading. Either by being provoked to or forced to, she attacks the player. After she loses the battle, she manages to flee the scene. Later she does find what she was looking for - the treasured pagoda, the other key to releasing [[Byakuren Hijiri]] - in a second-hand goods store (conceivably [[Kourindou]]).

Later, in the middle of Stage 5, she encounters the player once more. Seeing that her allies have brought the player with the treasure, she decides to test out the pagoda against her in the meantime. She loses once more, and escapes to return the pagoda to her master, Shou.

;''Double Spoiler''
:{{Main|Double Spoiler#Story|l1=Double Spoiler Story}}
In ''[[Double Spoiler]]'', Nazrin appeared as a [[stage]] 7 target, where she demonstrates her dowsing abilities to [[Aya Shameimaru]] and [[Hatate Himekaidou]] at their request to dig up a few old coins. Of course, she's actually using them as weapons in the [[spell card]]. She follows up on this by digging up some gold, fully demonstrating her dowsing abilities.

;''Hopeless Masquerade''
[[File:Th135Nazrin.png|frame|Nazrin in ''HM'']]
Nazrin made a background cameo appearance in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'' on the [[Palanquin Ship]]. She is seen standing on the ship waving her dowsing rods.

===Literature===
;''Wild and Horned Hermit'' chapter 2
She appears in chapter 2 of ''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'' along with Shou as part of the large crowd gathered to observe [[Kanako Yasaka|Kanako]] and [[Sanae Kochiya|Sanae]]'s cold fusion experiment.

==Relationships==
;[[Shou Toramaru]] and [[Minamitsu Murasa]]
Nazrin, while being a mouse youkai leader herself, is also Shou Toramaru's only known underling. She went to search for the lost pagoda on Shou's command, further showing her loyalty by keeping it a secret from [[Minamitsu Murasa]] - she states in [[Undefined Fantastic Object/Story/Marisa B's Scenario|Marisa B's story]] that Shou was probably too embarrassed to admit having lost it in the first place. It is stated in ''Symposium of Post-mysticism'' that she only really comes to the temple when Shou calls her, and otherwise lives in a little house she built near Muenzuka for the purposes of finding treasure there.
;[[Bishamonten]]
Originally, Nazrin had been placed as Shou's underling by Bishamonten in order to keep an eye on her, but as Shou exceeded all expectations, it eventually became unnecessary.

==Additional Information==
*According to the game transcript (namely Reimu-A and Marisa-B), Nazrin is the only [[stage]] 1 [[boss]] in a [[Windows]] game to escape rather than actually be defeated by the heroine. She would also be one of two only stage 1 bosses to not been defeated; the other being [[Yuyuko Saigyouji]].
*She is one of the few stage 1 bosses that actually have something to do with the plot, as opposed to "a pointless encounter with a pointless person", as [[Marisa Kirisame]] puts it. Another one is [[Seiran]] in ''[[Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom]]'', who is involved in the lunarian invasion of Gensokyo.
*She is also the only [[Windows]]-era stage 1 boss who attacks the heroines out of necessity rather than aggression (like [[Rumia]] or [[Letty Whiterock]]), or irritation (like [[Yamame Kurodani]] or [[Minoriko Aki]]).
*She was featured on the cover of ''[[Undefined Fantastic Object]]'' demo CD.
*Her Hard-Lunatic mid-boss spell card looks almost exactly like [[Sara]]'s last attack pattern. (Also with Rumia, coincidence?)

One was the fragments of Flying Storehouse that were being called the flying treasure.&lt;br /&gt;
The other was the [[Jeweled Pagoda of Bishamonten|jeweled pagoda of Bishamonten]].

{{nihongo|'''Nemuno Sakata'''|坂田 ネムノ|Sakata Nemuno}} is a yamanba who lives alone on the [[Youkai Mountain]].

==General Information==
Nemuno appeared as the Stage 2 midboss and [[Boss]] in ''[[Hidden Star in Four Seasons]]''.

===Personality===
Nemuno Sakata is a reclusive youkai who lives independently on Youkai Mountain. She has no interest in the world at large. Her way of living is very primitive, even by Gensokyo’s standards. She doesn't like trespassers and will attempt to drive away any intruder she comes across, be it human or youkai. &lt;ref&gt; ''[[Hidden Star in Four Seasons]]'' - Nemuno's Profile &lt;/ref&gt; This treatment is harsher with tengus, as they signed a non aggression treatment which says tengu need to leave her alone in her territory &lt;ref&gt; ''[[Hidden Star in Four Seasons]]'' - ''"You're not s'posed t' be here. We made an agreement." "So that's your way of doin' things, huh? Decidin' all by yourselves to scrap our non-aggression treaty?"'' ([[Hidden Star in Four Seasons/Story/Aya's Scenario#Stage 3|Aya]]'s Scenario) &lt;/ref&gt;

However, she does have a benevolent side to her. She likes strong people. In ''[[Hidden Star in Four Seasons]]'', she became more negotiable after fighting the protagonist. In Reimu’s scenario in particular, Nemuno tries to invite Reimu for some tea.

===Abilities===
;Ability to create sanctuaries
She has the ability to create sanctuaries, the exact meaning of this is unknown.

==Character Design==
===Name===
Her full name is {{nihongo|''Nemuno Sakata''|坂田 ネムノ}}. The characters for {{nihongo|''Sakata''|坂田}} are spelled with {{nihongo|''saka''|坂}} "hill, incline, slope", and {{nihongo|''ta''|田}} "rice field".
Her surname {{nihongo|''Sakata''|坂田}} is a reference to {{nihongo|''[[wikipedia:Kintarō|Sakata no Kintoki]]''|坂田 金時}} a child of superhuman strength who was raised by a [[Yamanba]]. He was first known as {{nihongo|Kintarō|金太郎|lit. Golden boy}} but after catching [[wikipedia:Shuten-doji|Shuten-dōji]] he became a loyal follower of [[wikipedia:Minamoto no Yorimitsu|Minamoto no Yorimitsu]] and changed his name to {{nihongo|''Sakata no Kintoki''|坂田金時}}.


Her first name {{nihongo|''Nemuno''|ネムノ}} may refer to the [[wikipedia:Albizia julibrissin|Albizia julibrissin]] (known as {{nihongo|"nemunoki"|ネムノキ|lit. "sleeping tree"}} in Japanese).

===Design===
Nemuno has red eyes and wavy waist-length grey hair that falls down naturally in a somewhat ragged fashion.  She wears blue detatched sleeves and a knee-length three colored dress, resembling a one-shoulder tunic, that wraps over her left shoulder yet still leaves both shoulders bare. Her dress has three color regions - yellow/gold on top, orange in the middle, and red on the bottom, all divided in a nonparallel manner by ragged white trim.  The bottom is perforated with two and a half staggered rings of diamond-shaped holes and her detached sleeves bear a similar design.
Nemuno wields a giant [[Wikipedia:Cleaver|cleaver]] with a red bow at the front of the handle.  She does not wear any footwear.

==Appearances==
;''Hidden Star in Four Seasons''
[[File:Th16NemunoSprite.png|frame|Nemuno's sprite in ''HSiFS'']]
:{{Main|Hidden Star in Four Seasons#Story|l1=Hidden Star in Four Seasons: Story}}
Nemuno attacks the protagonist, who has reached a secluded area on [[Youkai Mountain]]. Nemuno is confused as to why an outsider would enter this place, but attacks in order to protect her territory. She is defeated shortly after.

==Relationships==
Due to Nemuno's solitary nature, it is unknown if she possesses any relationship with the people of Gensokyo (other than vaguely speaking with the protagonists in HSiFS), however it can be assumed that she is the most isolated from Gensokyo.

Nemuno Sakata&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Species: Yamanba&lt;br /&gt;
Ability: Capable of creating sanctuaries&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

A youkai who lives on the Youkai Mountain.&lt;br /&gt;
Yamanba are a species that enjoy acting independently, without forming groups or societies.&lt;br /&gt;
They barely ever interact with fellow members of their species; on the other hand, they're known to interact with other species.&lt;br /&gt;
However, it's always a business-like kind of interaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

They're completely the opposite of the society-loving tengu. It seems that they form nonaggression treaties with other species and live on their own.&lt;br /&gt;
In the Human Village, it's generally assumed that people who go missing in the mountains were ''dealt with'' somehow by a yamanba.&lt;br /&gt;
But in reality, it seems that they often send lost adults back with a warning, and take custody of lost children, who they raise into upstanding human beings. The reason for this is unknown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Nemuno herself, likewise, has no interest in the world at large. She's primitive even by Gensokyo's standards, and there's hardly any information on her.

'''Nitori Kawashiro''' ({{lang|ja|河城 にとり}} ''Kawashiro Nitori'') is a somewhat shy [[Kappa]] who lives in [[Genbu Ravine]] on [[Youkai Mountain]]. She has the power to control water, and along with the other kappa she is very good with engineering and technology.

==General Information==
She first appeared as a stage 3 boss in ''[[Mountain of Faith]]'' and then became a playable partner with [[Marisa Kirisame]] in ''[[Subterranean Animism]]''. She was later a Day 6 boss in ''[[Impossible Spell Card]]'', and a playable character in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'' and ''[[Urban Legend in Limbo]]''. According to [[ZUN]], there were also plans to make her a playable character in ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]'', but she was scrapped due to time constraints.

===Personality===
Nitori is a shy kappa by nature and if she is alone and sees a human, she'll run away, like in Mountain of Faith. She considers herself to be superior to humans and even other youkai and when she's by herself it's easy to see. However, when among her own circle of friends, she is quite cheerful. As a kappa, she is easily persuaded to leave you alone by a cucumber or two. However, she has a greedy side when it comes to running a stand and is quick to come up with plots to maximize profit.

===Abilities===
;Manipulation of water
Her ability to manipulate water is inherent in the fact that she is a kappa, and has nothing to do with the myriad tools she uses. No one knows the true extent of this power, but she has been seen to use it to shoot water, create fountains, perform theatrical tricks and even summoning colossal tidal waves.

;Using tools
Akyuu makes a note that kappa, historically, have had an trait called tsuuhai (通背), which means their arms are connected inside their body and they can stretch one arm by retracting the other. However, it is said that they are actually just using tools to make it seem as though their arms stretch.&lt;ref&gt;[[Symposium of Post-mysticism/Nitori Kawashiro]]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Wild and Horned Hermit]] chapter one, Reimu receives a "kappa's arm" that ends up being a mechanical arm. In [[Hopeless Masquerade]], Nitori is also seen using several arm-like machines to attack.

===Occupation===
As she is an engineer she is very interested in products made by the humans of the outside world. She takes such products apart and puts them back together in order to understand them. However, she has trouble creating magical tools of any sort. She is fond of selling her inventions and other things such as Fish as her story mode in Hopeless Masquerade details her attempts at running a stand before getting sucked into the battle.
According to [[Hina Kagiyama]], she is also somewhat of a leader figure for the [[kappa]].&lt;ref&gt;Foul Detective Satori Chapter 19&lt;/ref&gt;

===Possessions===
Nitori possesses many small devices and objects and carries them all in her backpack.

==Character Design==
[[Image:ThGKNitori.png|thumb|right|200px|Nitori, as she appears in ''[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]]''.]]
===Name===
Her full name is ''Nitori Kawashiro'' ({{lang|ja|河城 にとり}}). ''Kawashiro'' ({{lang|ja|河城}}) means "river({{lang|ja|河}}) castle({{lang|ja|城}})". ''Nitori'' is in hiragana. 

Her name might have originated from [[Wikipedia:Ryūnosuke Akutagawa|Ryuunosuke Akutagawa]]'s novel ''Kappa'' the second chapter of which begins with the sentence {{lang|ja|「そのうちにやっと気がついてみると、僕は仰向けに倒れたまま、大勢の'''河童にとり'''囲まれていました。」}}''(Sono uchi ni yatto kigatsuite miru to, boku wa aomuke ni taoreta mama, oozei no '''kappa ni tori''' kakomarete imashita.'', "When at last I came 'round, I found myself lying on my back surrounded by a large number of kappa.") — from the translation by Seiichi Shiojiri.

===Design===
Nitori has blue hair tied into twintails and blue eyes in ''Mountain of Faith''. She wears a blue dress with lots of pockets around the hem of the skirt and her upper arm, and a dark aquamarine backpack with a golden key on the strap in front of her. She also wears a green hat with a white wispy symbol on it, blue wellington boots and carries a cattail. As an engineer she carries a lot of tools with her in the pockets.

==Appearances==
===Games===
;''[[Mountain of Faith]]''
[[File:Th10NitoriSprite.png|frame|Nitori's sprite in ''MoF'']]
When she first sees the heroine, she immediately runs away, but comes back and ambushes her. After the midboss fight, she says her "optical camouflage suit" broke, which confuses the heroine. Nitori mentions that the heroine is pretty strong and beat her even with the camouflage, then warns them that the mountain is dangerous for humans.
:{{Main|Mountain of Faith/Story/Reimu's Scenario#Stage 3|l1=Reimu Arc}}
When Reimu and Nitori meet again, Nitori immediately begins to warn Reimu about how dangerous the mountain is again, but Reimu ignores the warning, telling Nitori that she is in her way and she wants to talk to the [[Kanako Yasaka|gods]] there. Nitori again warns her but Reimu does not listen. Nitori attacks Reimu as a last-ditch attempt to get her to turn back and leave the mountain, but Reimu defeats her in a duel. Nitori is shocked, but says that [[kappa]] and humans are sworn friends, and so tells all of the other kappa to let Reimu go up the mountain.

:{{Main|Mountain of Faith/Story/Marisa's Scenario#Stage 3|l1=Marisa Arc}}
Much like in Reimu's scenario, Nitori shows up trying to test her optical camouflage suit -- which doesn't work. She is insistent, like in Reimu's scenario, that Marisa turn around and leave the mountain. Marisa quips about how if somebody tells you not to do something, you'll just want to do it more, and the two get into a duel. Nitori loses and says that human and kappa are sworn friends, leaving to tell the other kappa to let her through.

In the end the kappa accepted the new gods of the mountain.

;''[[Subterranean Animism]]''
:{{Main|Subterranean Animism/Translation/Marisa and Nitori's Scenario|l1=Marisa and Nitori's Scenario}}
During the events of ''Subterranean Animism'', she is one of the kappa who hears from the God of the sky, [[Kanako Yasaka]] about the new power of nuclear fusion in the [[Underworld]]. However, they are unwilling to go there due to the [[oni]] living underground. Learning that Reimu is going underground to investigate, she convinces Marisa to explore there as well, since she doesn't seem to have anything better to do.

===Spin-offs===
;''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]''
:{{Main|Hopeless Masquerade/Story/Nitori's Scenario}}
She's trying to run a stall by the temple when Byakuren confronts her over her pricing. They fight and after winning, Nitori finds herself getting into fights when all she wants to do is make money. She tries to convince Reimu into letting her open a stall there but she refuses, leading to a fight. Mamizou ends up surprised by Nitori appearing before her. When she finds Kokoro, she has the idea of trying to sell her some masks that might have some hope, provoking the final battle.

[[File:FSNitori.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Nitori appearance in [[Forbidden Scrollery]] chapter 29]]
;''[[Impossible Spell Card]]''
Presumably from hearing or seeing a wanted sign about the mischief-making [[amanojaku]] [[Seija Kijin]], Nitori appears to be one of the many [[youkai]] that tries to capture her. She uses [[spell card]]s that are considered impossible to dodge.

;''[[Urban Legend in Limbo]]''
:{{Main|Urban Legend in Limbo/Story/Nitori's Scenario}}
Nitori, ever a prospective entrepreneur, uses the [[Urban Legend in Limbo|Urban Legend Incident]] for profit, and travels across [[Gensokyo]] attempting to sell and buy [[Occult Ball|Occult Balls]], using an [[wikipedia:Loch Ness Monster|artificial Urban Legend]]. Because they cannot be exchanged without a fight between two persons holding them, she mostly ends up taking other people's Occult Balls without paying for them.

;''[[Antinomy of Common Flowers]]''
In ''[[Antinomy of Common Flowers]]'', Nitori again seeks to profit from the incident by artificially reproducing it. She teams up with [[Hata no Kokoro]] and uses her power over emotions to aid in research. Nitori ends up creating a mask that can simulate Perfect Possession.

===Literature===
{{stub|section}}
;''Wild and Horned Hermit''
Nitori frequently appears in ''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'', mostly with other kappas. She's commonly seen operating in business ventures to seek profit from current fads or events, running stalls selling goods or building structures with the other kappas. Her first appearance is as a cameo in the first chapter to illustrate a kappa losing its arm, but didn't get properly introduced until chapter 12.

In chapter 12, Nitori was amongst the kappa driven out of their hideout in [[Genbu Ravine]] due to the huge pillar of water created by [[kishin]] chief [[Suiki]] to attack [[Seiga Kaku]]. She expressed fears that the kappa may have angered Lord Suiryuu, but this fear was unfounded.

In chapter 22, Nitori was one of the kappas who searched for [[Manzairaku]] using sonar and searchlights. Perturbed by crowds gathering to watch the seal, she and the kappas moved it to the [[Abandon Pond]] and opens The Manzairaku Show there. simultaneously moving away the crowd and "making a killing" while at it. When Manzairaku becomes depressed, it was Nitori who asked Kasen for help. After being explained that the sea mammal requires saltwater and fish, Nitori and the kappas builds an artificial saltwater pool for it.

In chapter 25, seeing signs of an astronomy boom, Nitori builds a planetarium in the [[human village]], she gave Reimu a VIP ticket to assuage the shrine maiden's fears of a youkai gathering.

In chapters 38 and 39, Nitori was one of the kappas who worked on the construction of the [[Moriya Shrine]] ropeway. She convinced Sanae to power the ropeway using geysers belonging to the shrine, exploiting that the geysers will quickly render the machines unusable, requiring monthly maintenance (and payments to the kappa). When the ropeway was delayed, she swears to Kasen that the kappa would never intentionally cause a breakdown on their creations to help their business.

;''Forbidden Scrollery''
In chapters 14 and 15, Nitori along with the other kappas were using an old shack close to the [[Human Village]] as a warehouse to keep their items because the [[Abandon Pond]], their original warehouse, was completely frozen. To keep off the humans from approaching they used the "Seven Wonders" to conceal their identities and to guard the shack. After Reimu told them the humans already noticed something strange was going on, Nitori couldn't help but to find another place to store their items, the Forest Ghost Mansion Warehouse.

In chapters 28 and 29, Nitori and the kappas ordered a printed book from [[Suzunaan]] and was detected by [[Mamizou Futatsuiwa]]. Suspicious of their activities, Mamizou infiltrates the kappa's secret cucumber garden where they were growing cucumbers. After detecting and confronting Mamizou and explaining that the kappa started growing cucumbers using a book on selective breeding of cucumbers from the [[outside world]], Nitori reveals that the book she ordered printed from Suzunaan was a manual on cucumber recipes and preservation methods and that the book itself can allow the holder to use magic on a cucumber to make cucumber dishes.

;''Visionary Fairies in Shrine''
In chapters 11 and 11.5 of ''[[Visionary Fairies in Shrine]]'', Nitori and the kappas, due to their hideout being flooded, started a new business of "canyoning", where customers would be carried down the river currents, making use of the unusually strong river currents in the [[Genbu Ravine]] at the time along with the kappa's ability to manipulate water. After finding the three fairies, Nitori used them as guinea pigs to test the river courses. The canyoning business was a success and Nitori managed to convince [[Marisa Kirisame]] to try it out. However, after Clownpiece's torch caused a kappa's power to go out of control and throw an entire river into the sky in the shape of a dragon, the canyoning business was temporarily suspended due to safety concerns.
;''[[Lotus Eaters]]''
{{stub|section}}

==Relationships==
;[[Marisa Kirisame]]
Nitori knows [[Marisa Kirisame]]. In the story of [[Subterranean Animism]] the kappa heard news about nuclear power and Nitori asked Marisa to investigate underground. 
;[[Kappa]]
Obviously she is in a friendly relationship with the other kappa. With the other kappa they experiment and invent with new items. She is seen with the other kappa in ''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'' and ''[[Forbidden Scrollery]]''. It should be noted that Kappa are not that great at group projects so it's not likely that she'd work with them.
;[[Human]]s
Humans aren't aware of it, but she states kappa are friends with humans. Nitori in particular is too shy to be with a human when by herself. Even so, ''Symposium of Post-mysticism'' states that as a kappa, if a human gets too close she'll remove their shirikodama, and the human will die. She can even use her extending arms (tsuuhai) to grab a person's legs from a distance and drag them in. Because of the conflicting information, it's not really known just how much of an "ally" the kappa are to humans.

;[[Sunny Milk]], [[Luna Child]] and [[Star Sapphire]]
During the events of ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'', the [[Three Fairies of Light]] are shown working at Nitori's stall, near the [[Hakurei Shrine]].

==Additional Information==
*Nitori's "Optical Camouflage" [[Mountain of Faith/Spell Cards/Stage 3#Spell Card 27|spell cards]] may refer to another aspect of kappa that Akutagawa writes about: "But what is most remarkable about kappa is that, unlike human beings, they change colors according to their surroundings."
*Her backpack resembles a tortoise shell, fitting for a kappa.
*Nitori is the only playable partner in ''[[Subterranean Animism]]'' who never appeared in ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]''; all the other partners, including Reimu's, did.
*Nitori's last word in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'', ''"Super Scope 3D"'', partially resembles the [http://www.ssbwiki.com/Grenade_Launcher Grenade Launcher], [[wikipedia:Solid Snake|Solid Snake]]'s Final Smash from ''[[wikipedia:Super Smash Bros. Brawl|Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]''. Also, the name itself could possibly be a reference to the [[wikipedia:Super Scope|Super Scope]] and/or [[Twilight Frontier]]'s fangame ''[[DynaMarisa 3D]]''.
* One of her alternate color palettes in [[Urban Legend in Limbo]] resembles [[Hong Meiling]].

In the end, since Reimu and company didn't take her advice, Nitori secretly decided to let them into the mountain. She thought it would be interesting to watch them interact with the mysterious new god.

As a result of the ensuing battle, the kappa came to accept the new god of the mountain.

Ability: Manipulating water

A kappa that lives on the mountain.&lt;br/&gt;
Recently, the kappa heard some news that greatly excited them. According to the gods of the mountain, a high-temperature nuclear furnace was being completed underground. They wanted to get their hands on it as soon as possible to perform various tests with it.

However, the kappa didn't want to go underground where the oni lived. As they were wondering how they could investigate the underground, they heard a rumor that Reimu would be going there at the request of the other youkai.

Ever taking the initiative, Nitori decided to go convince Marisa to explore underground, since Marisa didn't seem to have anything better to do.

{{nihongo|'''Noroiko'''|呪い子}} is a [[humanoid]] of some kind that seems to be cursed and is the [[stage]] 2 [[Boss|midboss]] of ''[[Story of Eastern Wonderland]]''. She attacked [[Reimu Hakurei]] and [[Genjii]] after they've flown passed some [[crow]]s and [[Evil Eye]]s as they approached her. She shoots only one type of bullet that vaguely homes towards Reimu; her white bullets are the [[wikipedia:Kanji|kanji]] character {{nihongo||呪|Noroi|lit. "Curse"}}. With having no dialogue with Reimu, there is nothing known about her.

==Character Design==
===Name===
The name {{nihongo|''Noroiko''|呪い子}} is unofficial and is was taken from the Japanese fanbase, who notably uses the name to refer to this character. The {{nihongo|"Noroi"|呪い}} means "Cursed", referencing the kanji bullets she shoots, while {{nihongo|"ko"|子}} is a common general-purpose suffix in Japanese female names that literally means "child". There is also the western name {{nihongo|"Kuroko"|黒子}} which suppose to mean "Black Child", but has proved to not be as popular since the character hasn't got any form black. It may also be referred to as the {{nihongo|"SoEW 2nd Stage Midboss"|封魔録二面中ボス}}.

===Design===
Her sprite shows that she has short, dark red hair tied with a red bow. She seems to wear a purple skirt and a purple shirt with white long sleeves. There is a jagged, red design along the hem of her dress and there appear to be some aura around her.

{{nihongo|'''Nue Houjuu'''|封獣　ぬえ|Houjuu Nue}} is said to be one of the most mysterious and feared [[youkai]] in many years and has been defeated by [[human]]s many times. There are differing legends according to her appearance due to her concealed true form. At some point, she was sealed underground, but the events of ''[[Subterranean Animism]]'' caused her to resurface in [[Gensokyo]] during ''[[Undefined Fantastic Object]]''.

==General Information==
Nue Houjuu first appeared in ''[[Undefined Fantastic Object]]'' as the midboss of Stages 4 and 6 hidden in a ball of light, and takes on her true form as the Extra stage boss. She later appeared as the Extra stage midboss of ''[[Ten Desires]]''. Based on one of [[Reimu Hakurei]]'s quotes in ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]'', as well as Chapter 12 of ''[[Oriental Sacred Place]]'', she is currently living with [[Byakuren Hijiri]] in the [[Myouren Temple]].

===Personality===
Nue is a mischievous girl who is sensitive about her true form. She enjoys playing pranks. Being over 800 years old, most people are younger than her. She usually treats them as such due to her nature as an ancient Youkai. After the events of the Extra Stage in ''[[Undefined Fantastic Object]]'', she trains at the [[Myouren Temple]]. However, she is not well-acquainted with the other youkai, and has been seen near the edges of the property looking bored.

===Abilities===
;Making objects unidentifiable
Nue is able to conceal the true nature of other objects. She used this ability in ''Undefined Fantastic Object'' to conceal the nature of the fragments of the Flying Storehouse. 
An object that has lost its "identity" will appear to be a different thing depending on who observes it.

;Concealing her true form
Nue can modify her appearance to some extent at will. She has been seen as a ball of light in Stage 4 and Stage 6 of ''[[Undefined Fantastic Object]]'' as well as in a humanoid form (which she considers her true form) during the Extra Stage of ''Undefined Fantastic Object''.

;Contact with the outside world
Nue is able to contact the [[outside world]], which is evident from her relationship with [[Mamizou Futatsuiwa]] in ''[[Ten Desires]]''.

===Possessions===
;Three-pronged Trident
Nue wields a trident that she carries wherever she goes. She uses it as a conduit for summoning Danmaku. It's possible that it can also be used for physical combat.

==Character Design==
[[File:ThGKNue.png|thumb|200px|Nue, as illustrated in ''[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]]'']]
===Name===
Her full name is {{nihongo|''Nue Houjuu''|封獣　ぬえ}}. Like [[Satori Komeiji|Satori]], her first name is also the name of her species, ''[[Nue (Species)|nue]]''. Nue's family name, {{nihongo|''Houjuu''|封獣}}, literally translates to "sealed beast". "{{lang|ja|封}}" might be in reference to Nue's imprisonment underground prior to the events of ''[[Undefined Fantastic Object]]''.

===Design===
Nue has short black hair and dark red eyes. She has three red metallic-looking wings on the right side of her back, and three blue arrow-shaped tails coming out from her left side. She carries a trident and has a snake on her right arm (which might be the [[Seed of Unknown Form]]), and she wears a black wristband on her left wrist.  Her dress is black with blue and white trims in the middle, a red bow on the front, and a small, yin-yang [[wikipedia:tomoe|tomoe]] design at the bottom corner of her dress. She wears black thigh-high stockings and red shoes with bows on them. In most official artworks, she is drawn with pointed ears.

;''Undefined Fantastic Object''
[[File:Th12NueSprite.png|frame|Nue's sprite in ''UFO'']]
[[File:Th12NueBall.png|frame|left|Sprite of Nue as a ball of light]]
During the events of ''[[Undefined Fantastic Object]]'', she found out that [[Minamitsu Murasa]] and the other [[youkai]] sealed underground resurfaced and were planning something. Not knowing exactly what, she decided to play a prank by putting the [[Seed of Unknown Form]] in the fragments of Flying Storehouse, one of the elements needed to revive [[Byakuren Hijiri]]. The snakes contained in the seeds caused the fragments to scatter into the air; the characters initially believe that the geyser from ''[[Subterranean Animism]]'' was the cause. These fragments are the UFOs that the player encounters during the game.

During stages 4 and 6, she hides her true form in a ball of light and observes the heroine collecting the storehouse fragments. She decides to secretly follow her, hindering her progress with bullet patterns and aiding her with power items and extra lives. Once she realizes what the plan of the other youkai is, she figures that the resurrection of Hijiri would benefit her and settles on helping the heroine. She appears in the Extra Stage in her true form during the heroine's investigation of the [[Seed of Unknown Form]].

;''Forbidden Scrollery''
In chapter 31 of ''[[Forbidden Scrollery]]'', Nue is revealed to be the one who spread the rumor of a bull-headed monster that tells a story that would make its listener die of fright, wishing to turn it into an urban legend. She explained to [[Mamizou Futatsuiwa]] that she got the idea after seeing other members of the [[Myouren Temple]] use urban legends and wanted to join in on the fun. Due to the rumor causing a fear of the unknowable, Nue can benefit from a world of terror without lifting a finger. With the help of Mamizou's tanuki transforming into bull monsters, more and more villagers came to believe in the story until [[Reimu Hakurei]] spreads a flier claiming the bull-headed monster to be Gozu-Tennoh the bull-headed emperor and that the deadly story was a misunderstanding. In the end, though the rumor didn't develop quite as planned, Nue is still satisfied as something unknowable has still taken hold of the human villagers.

==Relationships==
;[[Minamitsu Murasa]] &amp; [[Ichirin Kumoi]]
Nue appears to have known Minamitsu Murasa and Ichirin Kumoi before the events of ''Undefined Fantastic Object''.

;[[Byakuren Hijiri]]
Nue currently resides at Byakuren Hijiri's temple near the [[Human Village]], because Byakuren was too nice to ostracize her.

;[[Mamizou Futatsuiwa]]
[[Mamizou Futatsuiwa]] is Nue's friend. Nue summons her during ''[[Ten Desires]]'' to defeat [[Toyosatomimi no Miko]].

==Additional Information==
*Similar to [[Kogasa Tatara]], she tends to scare off people by using the fear of the unknown, or the fear of her true form.
*A number of Nue's danmaku have various references:
**They're heavily reminiscent of other characters', such as [[Flandre Scarlet|Flandre]], [[Yukari Yakumo|Yukari]], [[Rumia]], and [[Hina Kagiyama|Hina]]. Specifically, they tend to act as combinations of [[spell card]]s, often using one element from one, and one from another.
**The spell card "Danmaku X from a Wandering Star" in ''[[Double Spoiler]]'' has danmaku in shapes resembling that of the [[wikipedia:PlayStation|PlayStation]]'s button logos (×, ○, ∆ and □).
**In Kyoto, the streets are laid out in grid-like pattern. Her spell card [[Undefined Fantastic Object/Spell Cards/Extra#Spell Card 112|"Nightmare of Heiankyou"]] refers to this.
**Nue's first non-spell card attack resembles [[Vivit (Erich's Daughter)|Vivit]]'s ([[Erich]]'s daughter) first attack in her second form in ''[[Shuusou Gyoku]]''.
*Nue is the only Extra Stage boss to appear as a midboss in multiple stages. [[Ran Yakumo]] is also an Extra Stage boss who has been a midboss, albeit only for one stage.
*Nue's appearance as a ball of light on stages 4 and 6 is similar to the stage 2 midboss of ''[[Mystic Square]]''. [[Yuuka Kazami|Yuuka]] also turned into a ball of light during her battle in ''[[Lotus Land Story]]''. However, she bears more similarity to the [[Mysterious Orb]] in ''Lotus Land Story''. Their appearances are identical, and both drop items when leaving the screen, each ending with an extra life.
*Nue has the tag "Heian" on her song and a some of her spell cards. Heian may be referring to the [[wikipedia:Heian period|Heian period]] (794 AD–1185 AD) of Japanese history (traditionally depicted as a Golden Age in Japanese History) and/or to a former capital city of Japan (794 AD–1868 AD), [[wikipedia:Heian-kyō|{{nihongo|"Heian-Kyo"|平安京}}]], which is now the city of [[Kyoto]]. Her age of approximately 800 years also places her origins at the end of or during the Heian period.
**Her theme's title might refer to [[wikipedia:Heiankyo Alien|{{nihongo|"Heian-Kyo Alien"|平安京エイリアン}}]], a game developed in 1979.
**The bass line from the beginning of her theme is borrowed from [[wikipedia:UFO (Pink Lady song)|UFO]], a song by [[wikipedia:Pink Lady (band)|Pink Lady]].
*Nue is the first Extra stage boss in the [[Windows]] series to have not met the final boss prior to the beginning of the game.
*Nue is the first character to appear as a boss in the Extra stage of two different ''[[Touhou Project]]'' games.

'''Nue Houjuu'''

Species: Nue&lt;br&gt;
Ability: Making her true form unknown

A great curiosity.&lt;br&gt;
An extremely mysterious youkai that flies the night sky.&lt;br&gt;
That is Nue.

She's been defeated by humans many times before, but each time, accounts of her appearance are different.  According to one legend, she had the head of a monkey, the body of a raccoon dog, the legs of a tiger, and the tail of a snake.  According to yet another legend, she had the head of a cat, the body of a chicken, and the tail of a snake.

These legends were all made up, though.&lt;br&gt;
In reality, she never showed people her true form.&lt;br&gt;
She just enjoyed watching humans get frightened and imagine all sorts of strange things from afar.&lt;br&gt;
That was her daily work.

Eventually she got tired of that and leisurely spent a long time deep beneath the earth's surface, but she got mixed up in the turmoil surrounding the geyser incident and appeared above ground once more.

She saw Murasa and the others who had been underground with her also come above ground and start plotting something.
"Ah, finally I can have some fun again", she thought, and decided to give them some trouble by attaching the Seed of Unknown Form to the fragments of the Flying Granary.

The Seed of Unknown Form was a small snake-like flying object with no determined form.&lt;br&gt;
When people saw it, what they saw depended on their own experience and knowledge.

Since Reimu and the others didn't think that a block of wood had any business flying in the sky, they thought it was a round UFO of the sort that most exemplified unidentified flying objects.

Murasa and company thought that the fragments of the Flying Granary had been scattered about by the geyser, but it was in fact thanks to the Seed of Unknown Form.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

In any case, when it looked like others were having fun, Nue would find a way to mess with them from afar.  She didn't know what Murasa's group was planning, but she thought it would be funny if they failed.

However, humans appeared who seemed happy at the appearance of that unidentified flying object.&lt;br&gt;
She was interested to see what sort of human wouldn't be afraid of such a thing.&lt;br&gt;
So, she secretly followed them, sometimes helping them, sometimes getting in their way.

Eventually she found out that what Murasa was doing would benefit her, too, and came to regret what she'd done.

However, Byakuren did not ostracize her for having meddled with her return.&lt;br&gt;
The nue thought she would have no choice but to follow the monk for a while.

&lt;br/&gt;
A strange and wondrous youkai that lives in Myouren Temple.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The saint that Byakuren had been holding back had finally resurrected.&lt;br/&gt;
When she heard about this, she decided to pay back what she owed Byakuren
from last time (UFO) and called on an old youkai friend in order to
increase the power of the youkai.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Naturally, she kept this a secret from Byakuren.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
As a result, another youkai came to live at Myouren Temple.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Thus, she only served to make Byakuren even busier.

{{nihongo|'''Okina Matara'''|摩多羅 隠岐奈|Matara Okina}} is the main antagonist of ''[[Hidden Star in Four Seasons]]'', and [[Flandre Scarlet]]'s advisor in [[Touhou Gouyoku Ibun]] as well as being the true mastermind behind the black water incident. She is a secret [[god]] and one of the [[Sages of Gensokyo]].

==General Information==
Okina first appears as both the final boss and extra stage boss in ''[[Hidden Star in Four Seasons]]''. 

A hidden god of multiple faces and roles, she has remained out of sight for some time until the events of ''Hidden Star in Four Seasons''. As one of the [[Sages]], she has helped to create the [[Gensokyo]] of today. Currently, she maintains its balance and protects it from the [[Outside World]]. 

===Personality===
She is said to be the spitting image of a classic god, having no mercy for those who disrespect her and graciously blessing those who revere her. Though described as "hidden", her true form is the same as the face she shows publicly, a chaotic mashup of the aspects of several gods. During and after the [[Incident#List_of_Game_Incidents|Four Seasons Incident]], her personality is shown to be that of an ostentatious, confident, and prideful person, making magnificent displays of her power in order to bring attention to herself. Okina seems to somewhat pity her servants, wishing to release them from their position (although it's unknown whether she actually feels this way, as it's revealed in ''Hidden Star in Four Seasons'' that she may not have even intended to replace them at all).

===Abilities===
;Creating doors on the backs of anything
Okina can create doors on the back of anything, even living beings. The back doors act like portals and allow her to travel wherever she wishes, or to send something to somewhere else. Creating a back door on a living being allows her access to the energy of said living being. The [[Incident#List_of_Game_Incidents|Four Seasons Incident]] started when Okina powered up the denizens of Gensokyo by pouring life energy into the doors on their back. The effect was particularly pronounced when Okina powered up [[fairies]], beings who are intrinsically tied to nature. Those with Okina's back doors on their bodies are able to further power themselves up by collecting seasonal energy. Okina can take away the seasonal energy from those using her doors and expel them from the [[Land of the Back Door]]. She is unable to collect the energy of ''doyou'', the period between seasons, as it would harm her. Each being in Gensokyo has a corresponding seasonal door. For example, fairies like [[Cirno]] and [[Eternity Larva]] should have summer doors (though, in the case of Eternity, her door actually corresponded to doyou, implying that she may not be a fairy at all). It may be that seasonal doors are interpersonal even within species, however, as [[Reimu]] and [[Marisa]] (both [[human]]), have different seasonal doors in the forms of spring and winter respectively. 

The doors can act as portals and connect to the extradimensional [[Land of the Back Door]], through which a number of other doors of Okina's creation are accessible. These doors all connect to various places in Gensokyo and it seems anyone can go through them. It's currently unknown if Okina can control who can go through her doors, however it's implied that she can as she is able to cut off access to them at any point according to [[Aya Shameimaru|Aya Shameimaru's]] [[Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons/Story/Aya's_Extra|Extra Scenario]] in ''Hidden Star in Four Seasons''. 

;Manipulating life energy and mental energy
Okina possesses the ability to manipulate both life energy and mental energy. She lends this power to her servants [[Satono Nishida]] (mental energy) and [[Mai Teireida]] (life energy). The two are described as "extensions" of Okina's power. Okina's profile states that she suddenly gained these abilities at some point in the past, likely before the creation of Gensokyo. 

Life energy is primarily used by Okina to tamper with nature. In ''Hidden Star in Four Seasons'', she poured life energy into the backs of Gensokyo's residents, powering them up temporarily. When Gensokyo's fairies were powered up, the seasons began to wildly fluctuate throughout the land. The seasonal energy that this created can also be manipulated by Okina. In [[Wild and Horned Hermit/Volume 9#Chapter Forty Two: Take Back the Four Seasons (October 13, 2017)|Chapter 42]] of ''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'', Okina was revealed to be able to create youkai by using life energy. She created [[Aunn Komano|Aunn]] by opening a back door on a [[wikipedia:komainu|komainu]] statue and pouring life energy into it, turning the [[divine spirit]] of the statue into an actual living being. In the same chapter she offers to make it spring so that the flowers could bloom, affirming that she has direct control over the seasons. She also boastfully states that she can recreate the entirety of Gensokyo if she so pleases. In this light, it appears Okina's manipulation of life energy allows her to create life or take life at will. 

Okina's manipulation of mental energy has never been demonstrated or mentioned so far, so its mechanics are unknown. It may, however, have to do with the slave-like devotion her servants have for her as well as the protagonists having slight amnesia about what happened during their first battle with Okina.

==Character Design==
===Origin===
She is based on {{nihongo|[http://www.onmarkproductions.com/html/monkey-koushin-p3.html#shinraMYOUJIN Matara-jin]|摩多羅神}}, an esoteric, multifaceted God primarily of the esoteric [[wikipedia:Tendai|Tendai Buddhism]] sect, introduced by [[wikipedia:Ennin|Ennin]]. It should be noted that while small today, historically Tendai was among the most powerful and influential Buddhist schools in Japan.

Matara-jin is a [https://www.academia.edu/10033824/The_Cultic_World_of_the_Blind_Monks_Benzaiten_J%C5%ABzenji_and_Shukujin shukujin], a type of formerly commonly worshiped syncretic god of destiny and stars, but also a god of outcast communities, such as traveling performers. Such groups were also associated with holidays taking place in the "backdoor" (後戸) area of Buddhist temples, eg. a space behind the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honzon honzon], or main object of worship&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Faure, ''The Cultic World of the Blind Monks: Benzaiten, Jūzenji, and Shukujin'', p. 83: [the area behind the honzon] was visited by various categories of people, such as monks of low rank and lay brothers. During New Year ceremonies for instance, this space was crowded, not only by monks and sarugaku performers, but also by outcasts fulfilling a variety of roles (in particular that of policemen, kebiishi 検非違使). On the one hand, these low-class types were perceived as not very different from the demons which were to be exorcized on such occasions, and which would actually be impersonated by some outcasts. These demons were needed as symbols of the impending chaos, kept at bay by ritual. In other words, they served as scapegoats, whose expulsion reaffirmed social order.&lt;/ref&gt;, where Matara-jin was commonly enshrined as a protector deity.

Additionally, Matara-jin with time acquired the status of a god of noh, which lead to him being conflated with Hata no Kawakatsu. Kawakatsu, head of the immigrant Hata clan, is a culture hero commonly portrayed as a trusted associate of prince Shotoku, a patron of sericulture and as an unspecified god masquerading, or reincarnated, as a human. Additionally, medieval authors such as Konparu Zenchiku associated both Matara-jin and Hata no Kawakatsu with the [http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/deta/o/okinamen.htm okinamen mask]. 

Matara-jin was sometimes also portrayed as capable of repelling diseases and various spirituals hindrances, especially tengu, viewed as the enemies of Buddhist doctrine. In turn, he too was at times presented as a hindrance to be placated with ritual performances.

Modern researchers such as [https://www.persee.fr/doc/asie_0766-1177_2006_num_16_1_1258 William M. Bodiford] consider Matara-jin to be a combination of elements from the Hindu and Buddhist god Mahakala (an aspect of Shiva, also separately introduced to Japanese Buddhism as the god of luck Daikoku) and the Chinese afterlife deity Taizan Fukun (incorporated into Buddhist beliefs as one of the ten kings of hell and often invoked in esoteric contexts as a shukujin himself).

Multiple factors contributed to formerly widely venerated Matara-jin falling into obscurity. First of all, the status of the mt. Hiei temple complex, where he was worshiped, was damaged by Oda Nobunaga's campaigns. Perhaps even more importantly, in various polemics, Matara-jin was condemned as the god invoked during genshi kimyodan (玄旨帰命壇), a secret Tendai ritual which according to the authors of such texts was sexually explicit in nature. Finally, during the Meiji era, syncretic deities existing on the border between kami and buddhas completely fell from grace due to the official policy of separation of Shinto and Buddhism.

Like most deities worshiped in Japan before the implementation of the shinbutsu bunri (神仏分離) policies, Matara-jin was also enshrined alongside, conflated or confused with, and viewed as a manifestation of many other gods, Buddhas and other religious or folkloric figures.

Matara-jin is sometimes portrayed with two servants ([http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/deta/d/douji.htm douji]), Teireita and Nishita.

===Name===
Her full name is {{nihongo|''Okina Matara''|摩多羅 隠岐奈}}. The first kanji in ''Okina'', 隠 (''o''), means "hidden". 岐 (''ki'') could mean either "crossroads" or "theatre". 奈 (''na'') can refer to [[wikipedia:Naraka|Naraka]] (''Naraku'' 奈落), the Hindu and Buddhist version of hell (also known as ''Jigoku'' 地獄 in Japan), or to "the basement of a theatre". Altogether, Okina (隠岐奈) translates to something like "hidden hell theatre" or "hidden crossroads [in] hell/a theatre's basement". Of note is that 隠岐 (''oki'') sounds similar to 奥 (''oku'' lit. "backside"). Additionally, Okina (隠岐奈) is homophonous to ''Okina'' (翁 lit. "old man"), the name of a [http://db2.the-noh.com/edic/2013/02/matarajin.html mask], used in [[wikipedia:Noh|Noh]], [[wikipedia:Kyogen|Kyogen]], and [[wikipedia:Sarugaku|Sarugaku]] performance. In Japanese [[Buddhist]] religious performances the mask represents a [http://www.lincolncenter.org/article/masks-of-noh god of the same name] often conflated with Matarajin. ''Matara'' (摩多羅) comes from the first three kanji of Matarajin (摩多羅神 lit. "god of matara") and is the Japanese transcription of the Sanskrit plural for "mother", [[wiktionary:मातृ|"mā́taraḥ" (मातर)]]. Thus, the kanji in Matara/Matarajin have no real meaning besides to mimic the sounds of the foreign "mā́taraḥ". Matarajin contains the Sanskrit plural for mother in his name due to his association with several female deities including, but not limited to: the [[wikipedia:Dakini|dakini]], [https://ja.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/荼枳尼天 Dakiniten], [[wikipedia:Benzaiten|Benzaiten]], [http://seesaawiki.jp/toho-motoneta_2nd/d/%C8%EB%B5%B7%A1%D6%E3%D2%C6%E1%A4%CE%B2%D0%A1%D7 Ena-Tenjin], [[wikipedia:Hariti|Hariti (Kishimojin)]], [[wikipedia:Mahakali|Mahakali]], [https://japanshrinestemples.blogspot.com/2017/08/chijin-earth-god.html?m=1 Kenro Jijin/Kenro Jiten (Prithvi)], and, mainly, the [[wikipedia:Matrikas|Saptamatara/Saptamatrika (Shichimoten)]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kawade.co.jp/np/isbn/9784309224947] "闇の摩多羅神/Yami no Matarajin" by Minato Kawamura&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="faure"&gt;[https://www.uhpress.hawaii.edu/title/protectors-and-predators-gods-of-medieval-japan-volume-2] "Protectors and Predators: Medieval Gods of Japan Volume 2" by Bernard Faure&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="daikoku"&gt;[http://www.onmarkproductions.com/Daikokuten] "Daikokuten Iconography" by Mark Schumacher&lt;/ref&gt;

;Okina's name in relation to the Oki Islands
The first two kanji in ''Okina'', 隠岐 (''oki''), make up the name of the [[wikipedia:Oki_Islands|Oki Islands (隠岐諸島)]]. The Oki islands is where the story of the [[wikipedia:Hare_of_Inaba|White Hare of Inaba]] supposedly took place. In said story, the god [[wikipedia:Okuninushi|Okuninushi]] helps direct the hare to heal himself after noticing the hare was flayed. Okuninushi is said to be one in the same with the god [[wikipedia:Daikokuten|Daikokuten]], who is the Japanized version of Indian god [[wikipedia:Shiva|Shiva's]] ultimate form, [[wikipedia:Mahakala|Mahakala]].&lt;ref name="daikoku" /&gt; Early on, Mahakala/Daikokuten was associated with a retinue of demonesses including the dakini and the seven mothers (Saptamatara/Shichimoten). The first time the name "Matarajin" appears in Japanese records it was used to describe a demonic three-headed yashajin (夜叉神 lit. "[[wikipedia:Yaksha|yaksha]] god") of [[wikipedia:Tō-ji|Toji]], who appears to be modeled after Mahakala. Several Buddhist texts identify Mahakala/Daikokuten and Matarajin to be one in the same.&lt;ref name="faure" /&gt; Interestingly, [[wikipedia:Lafcadio Hearn|Lafcadio Hearn]] (who is related to [[Yukari Yakumo|another character]]) wrote part of ''Glimpses of Unfamiliar Japan'' while visiting the Oki Islands. The islands also contain Myokensan (妙見山 lit. "[[wikipedia:Myoken|Myoken]] Mountain") and two of its places of worship, 妙見神社 (Myoken-jinja lit. "Myoken Shrine") and 妙見堂 (Myoken-ji lit. "Myoken Temple"). Myoken is another deification of the [[wikipedia:Big Dipper|Big Dipper]] with connections to Matarajin.

;Okina's name in relation to Kunado no Kami and Dosojin
The 岐 (''ki'') in ''Okina'' may derive from [[wikipedia:Kunado-No-Kami|Kunado no Kami]] (岐の神 lit. "god[s] of crossroads") and its derivative, [[wikipedia:Dosojin|Dosojin]] (道祖神 lit. "ancestral road god[s]"), also called Chimata no Kami (岐の神). Both types of gods are associated and identified with Matarajin because their purpose is to ward off pestilence and to remove hindrances, something that Matarajin is also responsible for. Dosojin also share the title of Shukujin (宿神 lit. "indwelling god", "god of destiny") with Matarajin. Additionally, both Kunado no Kami and Dosojin and are tied in with the [[wikipedia:Koshin|Koshin]] (庚申) ritual, something practiced heavily by the monks of the temples and shrines of [[wikipedia:Mount Hiei|Mount Hiei]], the center of [[wikipedia:Tendai|Tendai Buddhism]] and birthplace of the modern image of Matarajin. 

===Design===
She has long, blonde hair and yellow eyes. She wears a yellow-orange tabard adorned with a constellation pattern of stars representing the [[:wikipedia:Big Dipper|Big Dipper]], a symbol of Matara-jin and other associated deities. She wears a green skirt and black boots, and on her head is a three-point hat.

Her stage 6 portraits depicts her sitting on a "throne" and bearing a mirror-like [[:wikipedia:Tsuzumi|Tsuzumi drum]]. The throne has a backdoor installed in it, out of which flames in four colors emerge, each representing one of the four seasons.

Her extra stage portrait no longer has the throne and mirror, but the flames are still present. Instead, she has a wireframe-like door in front of her that she is looking through. Her eyes turn orange, her hair becomes longer and smoother and less pale-colored, as well as having bigger sleeves.

In [[Touhou Gouyoku Ibun]] Okina has a red cloverleaf knot on her tabard.

;Wheelchair
She is seen sitting in a wheelchair in various official printworks, such as [[Lotus Eaters]] and [[Visionary Fairies in Shrine]]. However, she does not require a wheelchair for mobility, as she is seen walking perfectly fine on various occasions, such as in [[Wild and Horned Hermit]]. Rather, she is the personification of disability itself. She represents all those who are affected by disability.

[[File:Th16ExtraStageOkinaSprite.png|frame|Okina's extra stage boss sprite in ''HSiFS'']]
{{Main|Hidden Star in Four Seasons#Story|l1=Hidden Star in Four Seasons: Story}}
Okina is the Stage 6 and Extra Stage Boss, along with being the Mastermind behind the '''Four Seasons Incident'''

She emerges from obscurity, wanting to find new replacements for her servants, Satono and Mai. She orders her servants to plant doors on the backs of others and empower them, with the purpose of bringing out their best to see if they are worthy of being Okina's servant. However, Reimu is not a fit candidate for the position due to 'Obvious Reasons'. Aya is also not deemed worthy as Okina is a God of Tengu warding. And Cirno is dismissed as being just a random fairy at first, then in the end, both her and Marisa were the worthy candidates, but they both refused to be Okina's servants. Deeming the player characters unworthy (or as in Marisa's case, tells her that she does not have a choice, and begins the fight saying that she will kill her if she's disappointed by her performance), she defeats them by taking the power they've gathered and expelling them to the beginning using the "door of seasons" planted on their backs. After gathering the lifeless boundary between seasons instead, preventing Okina from ejecting them again, the player returns and manages to defeat her. However, Okina's true goal is simply to stand out and make a show of her power, to engrave herself in the hearts and minds of everyone in Gensokyo once again, which means that her plan has succeeded.

;[[Violet Detector]]
{{Main|Violet Detector#Story|l1=Violet Detector: Story}}
[[File:Th175OkinaSprite.gif||thumb|frame|left|100px|Okina's sprite in ''GI'']]
Okina confronts [[Sumireko Usami]] in the [[Dream World]]. She is fascinated by her struggle and decides to help her through her ordeal by lending some power. When the Sumireko she helped finally meets with her other self, the real Sumireko, Okina takes back the power she lent her to make the fight fair.
;[[Touhou Gouyoku Ibun]]
During the events of Gouyoku Ibun, Okina leaks [[Yuuma Toutetsu]]'s plans to the residents of Gensokyo, and in an effort to stop her plan, she hires Flandre Scarlet to attack Yuuma. In reality, she is the mastermind behind the black water incident and had polluted the surface with the oil to make people aware of Yuuma. Once people were aware of her, Yuuma became the scapegoat for the pollution, and Okina was able to further the relationship between the Gouyoku Alliance and Gensokyo after Yuuma was defeated.

===Literature===
;''Wild and Horned Hermit''
{{Main|Wild and Horned Hermit}}
Okina makes her manga debut in chapter 42, directly following the events of ''Hidden Star in Four Seasons''. After revealing that she created [[Aunn]], she joins [[Reimu]] and [[Marisa]] in one of the [[Hakurei Shrine|Hakurei Shrine's]] regular flower-viewing parties. There, she boasts about her power over life energy, bragging that she could create youkai with a snap of her fingers, make the flowers bloom and seasons change at her will and even recreate [[Gensokyo]] if she so pleased. 

;''Visionary Fairies in Shrine''
{{Main|Visionary Fairies in Shrine}}
In chapter 14, [[Cirno]] and the other [[fairy|fairies]] make their way into the [[Land of the Back Door]], having decided that Okina was responsible for turning some other fairies into pure crystallized life force. Okina, nonchalantly sitting in a wheelchair, neither confirms nor denies the accusation. Rather, she is amused by Cirno and her friends and the prospect of battling them. In the final chapter, she shows her overwhelming superiority to the gang of fairies, and menacingly orders [[Clownpiece]] to "let the big shots in [[Hell]] know that Gensokyo is home to a secret terrifying [[god]]."

;''Lotus Eaters''
In chapter 24, several Zashiki-Warashi in the Human village went to Okina Matara so they could perform 'remote work' from the [[Land of the Backdoor]]. According to one of them, 
Zashiki-Warashi need to periodically change their place of residence in order to 'cultivate their power', and that they can monitor their households just as well from the [[Land of the Backdoor]], as it can 'connect' to anywhere as long as there is a door that nobody is watching.

==Relationships==
;[[Satono Nishida]] and [[Mai Teireida]]

Loyal servants of Okina. Vessels of her power, they act as extensions of her and unflinchingly obey her orders. They seemingly lack the free will to question otherwise. They are becoming less human due to Okina's influence and have little memory of their past, yet maintain their personalities. Whether because they're no longer useful or she pities them, Okina seeks to replace them, which she has periodically. However, after failing to find any, she says she is fine with retaining them. Satono and Mai do not know they are even searching for their own successors.
;[[Flandre Scarlet]]
During the events of [[Touhou Gouyoku Ibun]], Okina Matara hires Flandre Scarlet in order to take out [[Yuuma Toutetsu]] and thwart her plans.
===[[Sage|Sages of Gensokyo]]===
;[[Yukari Yakumo]]
It's implied in Reimu's extra stage in ''[[Hidden Star in Four Seasons]]'' that the two are familiar with each other, and that Yukari helped Reimu defeating Okina by suggesting her to use the "boundary between seasons" to fight her. Okina recognized Yukari's modus operandi, while Reimu said she didn't understand the logic behind the countermeasure method she was using. During the fireworks festival that Usami wrote about in [[The Grimoire of Usami]], the two banter about things as equals.
;[[Kasen Ibaraki]]
In chapter 42 of [[Wild and Horned Hermit]], Kasen reveals to [[Aya Shameimaru]] that Okina is one of her old acquaintances, and commented how it was a misfortune that she had known her.
===Minor Relationships===
;[[Zashiki-warashi]]
During [[Lotus Eaters]], several Zashiki-warashi in the Human village went to Okina Matara so they could perform 'remote work' from the [[Land of the Backdoor]]. According to one of them, 
Zashiki-warashi periodically need to change their place of residence in order to 'cultivate their power', and that they can monitor their households just as well from the [[Land of the Backdoor]], as it can 'connect' to anywhere as long as there is a door that nobody is watching.

*Okina is one of the four Touhou characters in the entire series to be both a maingame [[stage]] boss and the Extra Stage boss in the same game, with the other three being [[Rika]] in ''[[Story of Eastern Wonderland]]'', [[Alice Margatroid|Alice]] in ''[[Mystic Square]]'' and [[Junko]], partially, in ''[[Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom]]''. 
**Okina, however, is both the sole Windows-era boss and final boss to fully share these roles.
**She is also the first character since [[Yuuka Kazami]] from ''[[Lotus Land Story]]'' to fully be the boss of two consecutive stages. Plus they both have the season theme in common.
*Okina in the Extra Stage shares a spell background texture with [[Toyosatomimi no Miko]].
**The [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharmachakra wheel of Dhamma] is shown in one of her spell card backgrounds.
*Spell Card 116 is called ''Secret Ceremony "Sword of the Seven Stars"'' and [[Toyosatomimi no Miko]] also carries the "Seven Star Sword".
*[[ZUN]] originally planned for Okina to be in a wheelchair, because he wanted to address the issue of disabilities and how people with disabilities are the strongest. However, he decided that the topic was difficult to deal with in the game's theme, and that not treating it with the seriousness it deserves could become offensive.&lt;ref&gt;[[Strange Creators of Outer World/Hidden Star in Four Seasons Interview with ZUN]] - "At first the final boss was going to ride in a wheelchair, but that was really difficult. What's left of that is her sitting in a chair." &lt;/ref&gt;
*Though Okina is occasionally depicted being in a wheelchair in print works, she doesn't actually possess any sort of disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;[[Who's Who of Humans &amp; Youkai in Gensokyo]]: [[Strange Creators of Outer World/Who's Who of Humans &amp; Youkai in Gensokyo/Okina Matara|Okina Matara]]: "By the way, Okina is shown to be standing up in the Extra Stage, so it isn't that she actually has any leg impairments. She isn't saying that she ''has'' a disability, but that she ''is'' disability, and that perhaps disability is a necessary thing for this world." - ZUN &lt;/ref&gt;

Okina Matara&lt;br/ &gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Species: Secret God&lt;br /&gt;
Ability: Capable of creating doors on the back of anything&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

A hidden god who lurks behind all things in creation.&lt;br /&gt;
She has a wide range of public faces-- an Earth mother goddess, a god of ''noh'', a god of stars, a god of silkworm breeding, a god of hindrances, a god of [[wikipedia:Burakumin|discriminated peoples]], et cetera.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Nobody knows what her true nature really is.&lt;br /&gt;
She's the ultimate secret god, whose true form must never be seen, heard, or spoken of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Her status as a "secret god" doesn't mean she's hiding or anything, though.&lt;br /&gt;
At times, she makes ostentatious public appearances to show off her grand presence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

She claims that her objective was to find successors for Satono and Mai, but if she ended up unable to find any suitable successors, she'd be fine making the two servants continue to work for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Her true goal was to stand out.&lt;br /&gt;
To make a big show of herself, and engrave herself into the memories of every human, youkai, and sage in Gensokyo.&lt;br /&gt;
It seems she didn't find any successor servants in the end, but it appears that her latter goal was well and truly achieved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

She is also one of the sages who created the Gensokyo of today.&lt;br /&gt;
She protects Gensokyo from the outside world, can move anywhere she likes, and at some point without realizing it at first, she gained a mysterious power to control both vitality and mental energy, which she uses for her duty of keeping Gensokyo's balance intact.&lt;br /&gt;
Her menial tasks are usually entrusted to her two ''douji'' servants that wait upon her (ie. Satono and Mai).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

She shows no mercy to those who act rudely to her, and grants blessings to those who treat her with reverence.&lt;br /&gt;
Fearsome as an enemy and reliable as an ally, she's the classic example of a god.

　　そういえば、秘神ではあるが彼女は隠れているわけでは無いのだ。&lt;br /&gt;

Okina Matara&lt;br/ &gt;&lt;br /&gt;

The seasons on our heroines' backs were a trap that Okina had arranged.&lt;br /&gt;
Our protagonist used Okina's season trap to her own advantage, and challenged her for a rematch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

At this, the ultimate secret god agreed to refrain from chasing the protagonist off with the seasons' magic power, and revealed her true form.&lt;br /&gt;
It was a chaotic fusion of many gods' forms, every bit the same as the face she shows publicly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Speaking of which, she may be a "secret god," but she's not hiding.&lt;br /&gt;
From the very beginning, she was a secret god who put everything she has out in plain sight.

{{nihongo|'''Orange'''|オレンジ|Orenji}} is a [[youkai]] that appears in the mountains during the first stage of ''[[Lotus Land Story]]''. Apart from this, there is nothing else known about this character.

==Character Design==
===Name===
She is named for the color orange, a blend of red and yellow (both colors are prominent in her design).

Her name appears nowhere in the game, even in the Music Room, and only appears in the [[Lotus_Land_Story/Translation/Other#OMAKE.txt|OMAKE.txt]] file.

===Design===
In ''Lotus Land Story'''s official art, Orange has red eyes, long red hair, wears a yellow cap and has a white bow in her hair. She wears green and yellow clothing and carries a baton. Her hair turns blue during the final phase of her battle in ''Lotus Land Story''. As she bears resemblance to [[Hong Meiling]], she may have been part of the inspiration for Meiling.

{{nihongo|'''Parsee Mizuhashi'''|水橋　パルスィ|Mizuhashi Parusi}} is a [[hashihime]], or bridge princess, who guards the "bridge" between the surface world and the [[Underworld]]. She is able to control the jealousy in others.

==General Information==
Parsee first appeared as the [[stage]] 2 [[boss]] of ''[[Subterranean Animism]]''.

===Personality===
Parsee harbors intense feelings of jealousy due to being despised. No matter what situation the other person may be in, she'll always be jealous of it. Even if the other person is actually less fortunate, she will be jealous of the fact that they're not jealous. In this way, her jealousy is quite irrational. This isn't to say Parsee is actually unfortunate. If you were to talk to her directly, she would come off as completely normal – even a bit cheerful – but this masks the jealousy that she's actually feeling, and afterwards she will end up despising you and talking behind your back.

===Abilities===
;Manipulation of Jealousy
It is an ability from the legend of Hashihime. As a [[youkai]] who can be called the very embodiment of jealousy, she is able to manipulate those feelings in others. In relation to [[human]]s, it is a dreadful ability that can easily destroy them. She lives off of seeing the lives of those she introduces jealousy into being destroyed by it. This may be the reason she was sealed underground. She herself is deep in her own jealousy.

===Occupation===
Parsee used to be a guardian, someone who would watch over those crossing her bridge to make sure they passed between the underground and the surface world safely. However, her own jealousy at those travelers eventually caused her to be able to control feelings of jealousy in others.

===Species===
The {{nihongo|Hashihime|橋姫}} is a mythical [[youkai]] that appears in various Japanese texts (Most notably the [[Wikipedia:The Tale of the Heike|The Tale of Heike]]). After her husband left her and married another woman, the jealous and enraged Hashihime prays to the gods for revenge. A priest tells her a way: She has to dress herself in red and paint her face with the same color, her hair arranged with seven loops and crowned with a burning brazier, then spend 21 days under the Uji bridge while holding a metal rod. So deep was her rage and jealousy, that she actually did the entire process, becoming a vengeful youkai driven by jealousy that only appears in the vicinity of bridges that cross over water. She appears to loving couples, threatening to kill them both unless they break up right there and then. There is also a famous Noh Play about this mythological creature. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-noh.com/en/plays/data/program_026.html|title=Kanawa (Iron Trivet)|accessdate=18 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glopad.org/jparc/?q=en/node/21896|title=Hashihime {{lang|ja|橋姫}} [literally "bridge princess"&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;|accessdate=18 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nippon-kichi.jp/article_list.do;jsessionid=98EBB0CA3885C46AAA6513154C141D81?p=2486&amp;ml_lang=en|title={{lang|ja|能面 橋姫}}　Noumen Hashi-hime　Noh Mask Hashihime|accessdate=18 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://totaljapandemonium.wordpress.com/2011/01/26/the-yokai-files-hashi-hime/|title=The Yokai Files – Hashi Hime|accessdate=18 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[ZUN]] in an interview in [[Chara☆Mel]] released with ''[[Cage in Lunatic Runagate]]'' Chapter 7, the term {{nihongo||波斯人|hashihito}} refers to Persians, and he thought it would be interesting to try to make a more foreign-looking character, a Persian hashihime in old-style clothes, even if she doesn't really look like a hashihime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm5903008|title={{lang|ja|キャラ☆メル}}　vol.7 {{lang|ja|東方地霊殿神主インタビュー（前編）}}|publisher=Chara☆Mel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character Design==
[[File:ThGKParsee.png|thumb|150px|Illustration of Parsee in ''[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]]'']]
The name of Parsee's boss theme "Green-eyed Jealousy", as well as her midboss [[spell card]] and ''[[Double Spoiler]]'' title "The Green-Eyed Monster", are both terms used in Shakespeare's works to poetically describe jealousy.

===Name===
{{nihongo|''Parsee Mizuhashi''|水橋　パルスィ}} is her full name. Her family name {{nihongo||水橋|Mizuhashi}} means {{nihongo|"Water"|水}}) and {{nihongo|"Bridge"|橋}}. ''Parsee'' is an alternative spelling of "[[Wikipedia:Parsi|Parsi]]", who are the members of the Indian Zoroastrian community. They descend from Persian Zoroastrians who emigrated to South Asia in the 8th century AD. There's another possible connexion with "Parsee" and jealousy, although this could be a coincidence; "jealousy" in Italian is "gelosia", which can also relate to "[[Wikipedia:Window blind|Venetian blinds]]". These blinds can also be called "persiana" in Italian, where that word can also mean "Persian" if in its feminine form (NB: "persiano" is the masculine form).

Some Japanese people tend to pronounce her personal name "Parsee" [paɽɯ̥si] as if it were "Parseeh" [paɽɯ̥siː] or "Parshee" [paɽɯ̥ɕiː], maybe because there's a customary rule of Japanese engineer's terms that they ought to omit [[Wikipedia:Chōonpu|the long vowel mark]] at the end of a word, unless it isn't a short word; for example, "{{lang|ja|アッセンブラ}}" (assembler) although it's normally spelled as "{{lang|ja|アッセンブラ'''ー'''}}". Therefore, the correct spelling for "{{lang|ja|パルスィ}}" is "{{lang|ja|パールスィー}}".

===Design===
Parsee has wavy blond hair and green eyes, and her skin appears to have pale chartreuse tint to it. She wears a dress which resembles the traditional dresses of Iran's nomadic people, as well as Tocharians depicted in a [https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/QizilDonors.jpg 6th-century AD fresco from the Kizil Caves]; the top is brown with purple borders, with a white criss-cross pattern and a pink sash. The bottom is blue and purple with again the white criss-cross pattern and black with criss-crossed red strings hanging on the bottom edge. She has a pink scarf tied around her neck and pink puffy arm socks. Her SA appearance and other official artworks depict her with pointed ears.

==Appearances==
;Subterranean Animism
[[File:Th11ParseeSprite.png|frame|Parsee's sprite in ''SA'']]
In each scenario, Parsee wonders why a [[human]] has come to the [[Underworld]]. She is also unaware of the [[youkai]] that communicates with the heroine, which leads to various complications.

In [[Reimu Hakurei]]'s story arcs, Parsee wonders if Reimu is there for the "cursed powers" or, alternately, if she is there because of the earthquakes. With [[Marisa Kirisame]], Parsee warns the heroine against proceeding farther underground. In all cases, whether due to jealousy/anger with Reimu or Marisa's refusal to turn back, Parsee attacks and is defeated by the heroine.

:{{Main|Subterranean_Animism/Story/Reimu and Yukari's Scenario#Stage 2|l1=Reimu &amp; Yukari Arc}}
As Reimu descends underground, wondering how deep she has to go, Parsee shows up and asks why a human would need to get to the Former Capital, and asks if she's looking for their "cursed power". While [[Yukari Yakumo]] explains to Reimu that the youkai underground are strong, Parsee begins to get jealous of Reimu (without even knowing who she is) and attacks. Upon defeat, Yukari explains to Reimu how Parsee is a youkai driven by jealousy.

:{{Main|Subterranean Animism/Story/Reimu and Suika's Scenario#Stage 2|l1=Reimu &amp; Suika Arc}}
As Reimu descends underground, wondering how deep she has to go, Parsee shows up and asks why a human would need to get to the Former Capital, and asks if she's looking for their "cursed power". [[Suika Ibuki]] pipes up and says they don't need the cursed power, then immediately asks if she's the "Bridge Princess". Parsee, surprised that they know who she is, starts asking Reimu questions that she has no idea how to answer. Suika explains that she's a youkai driven by jealousy, and Parsee starts to grow tense at thinking that they're looking down on her, and attacks a confused Reimu. Upon defeat, Reimu scolds Suika for holding her own conversation. 

:{{Main|Subterranean Animism/Story/Reimu and Aya's Scenario#Stage 2|l1=Reimu &amp; Aya Arc}}
As Reimu descends underground, wondering how deep she has to go, Parsee shows up and asks if they are worried about the earthquakes above ground. [[Aya Shameimaru]] asks if she will do something interesting, to which Parsee throws the same question at them, asking if they'll do anything interesting. Reimu says no, explaining that they can always go see something interesting. Parsee becomes jealous, and attacks Reimu to relieve her boredom. Upon defeat, Reimu confronts Aya and thinks Aya just sent her to get material for her newspaper.

:{{Main|Subterranean Animism/Story/Marisa and Alice's Scenario#Stage 2|l1=Marisa &amp; Alice Arc}}
As Marisa descends underground, she wonders how many "floors are left in the dungeon". [[Alice Margatroid]] tries to explain that caves don't have "floors", as Parsee enters and replies that they're on "floor B666", calling the cave an underground skyscraper. Marisa gloats to Alice that she was right about the "floors", while Parsee asks if she's crazy because she's "talking to herself". Marisa asks if she's the "[[boss]] of the dungeon", and Parsee replies that she's just wasting time if she thinks going underground is a game, and attacks. Upon defeat, Marisa admits that she's just wasting time and moves on.

:{{Main|Subterranean Animism/Story/Marisa and Patchouli's Scenario#Stage 2|l1=Marisa &amp; Patchouli Arc}}
As Marisa descends underground, [[Patchouli Knowledge]] explains that [[Yamame_Kurodani|Yamame Kurodani]] was an earth spider that inflicts disease, a little late for their previous battle with her. Parsee enters and ask if she's exploring the underground, and Marisa says yes. Parsee replies that she's better off going back, when Marisa realizes she has to get past her and quickly tells Patchouli to look up her weak points. Parsee says that she tried to warn them, and Patchouli tells Marisa to deal with her by herself because she obviously can't look up weaknesses that quickly. Marisa tells Patchouli to look how to beat her while she's beating her, then Parsee attacks. Upon defeat, Patchouli was able to find the information (yet again, too late) that she's a Persian person driven by jealousy. Marisa wonders if Patchouli sent her just to conduct research.

:{{Main|Subterranean Animism/Story/Marisa and Nitori's Scenario#Stage 2|l1=Marisa &amp; Nitori Arc}}
As Marisa descends underground, she wonders how deep the cave goes. [[Nitori Kawashiro]] says that it's only a matter of time until they reach the "Ancient City". Parsee shows up an asks why they need to go to the underground city, where Marisa replies that she doesn't think she needs anything. Parsee then asks if they're lost, and says that they should return to where "the light is so dazzling". Nitori explains that Parsee controls jealousy, and that Marisa should just "beat her up" quickly. Marisa asks why she even went to the cave in the first place, and Nitori says it's because of the hot springs. While the two are talking, Parsee wonders why Marisa is talking to herself (because Parsee doesn't understand they're communicating) and wonders if anyone will mind if she just "beats up one person", then she attacks Marisa. Upon defeat, Marisa states that she still doesn't understand why they're underground, but "if hot springs are involved, it doesn't matter" then moves on.

;''Double Spoiler''
[[File:Th135Parsee.png|frame|Parsee in ''HM'']]
In ''[[Double Spoiler]]'', Parsee used a few [[spell card]]s and had [[Aya Shameimaru]] and [[Hatate Himekaidou]] taking photos of her and her [[danmaku]].

;''Hopeless Masquerade''
Parsee made a background cameo appearance in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'' on the [[Palace of Earth Spirits]] and the [[Youkai Tanuki Forest]] stage. She is seen behind all other characters with a glare.

&lt;br/&gt;
'''Parsee Mizuhashi'''

Species: Bridge Princess&lt;br/&gt;
Ability: Manipulating jealousy

Once, she was the protector, or guardian spirit, of the pit linking the [[underworld]] with the overworld. She watched over people to make sure that they could get to the underworld and back to the overworld safely.

However, as she is extremely jealous, she couldn't stand the people who looked like they were having fun going to and fro.
Whenever she saw someone like that, she would hinder their travel somehow.

Jealousy only begets further jealousy, so as she went mad from her own jealousy, she became able to fan the flames of jealousy in the hearts of others.

{{nihongo|'''Patchouli Knowledge'''|パチュリー・ノーレッジ|Pachurii Noorejji}} is a witch and resident of the [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]] in the library. She's friends with the mistress of the house, [[Remilia Scarlet]], and acts as resident librarian. She's known as a highly capable, experienced, and studious magician, usually found researching the countless tomes within the house library. But her great abilities are offset by her poor health, caused by long-time reclusivity and asthma.

==General Information==
Patchouli was the Stage 4 boss and Extra midboss in ''[[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]]'', along with being Stage 5 target in ''[[Shoot the Bullet]]''. She became a playable character in ''[[Immaterial and Missing Power]]'' and again in ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]'' and [[Touhou Hisoutensoku]] as an expansion character, she was a support character for [[Marisa Kirisame]] in ''[[Subterranean Animism]]''.

She is a [[magician]] (or witch) who is over 100 years old. As described in ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'', she is the type of magician that was naturally born as a magician; rather than a [[human]] that has become a magician through training, such as [[Alice Margatroid]].

She is "fairly short" and is around the height of Marisa and [[Youmu Konpaku]]&lt;ref&gt;[[ZUN's E-mails]]&lt;/ref&gt;. She stays confined to the library of the [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]] because the books and her hair are damaged by sunlight.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red/Patchouli]]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite her enormous magic power, she has a weak constitution, has asthma, is anaemic and has vitamin A deficiency. Her physical ability is worse than that of humans.

After the Scarlet Mist Incident during ''[[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]]'', she became somewhat more active. It was commented that [[Suika Ibuki]]'s party at the shrine was enjoyable for her&lt;ref&gt;Immaterial and Missing Power - Ending 8&lt;/ref&gt;, and in ''[[Silent Sinner in Blue]]'', she said that she herself came to the shrine to pull an [[wikipedia:Omikuji|omikuji]]. Incidentally, the result of the omikuji was {{nihongo|"future blessing"|末吉}}, though it seemed to have been something prepared by Marisa. It is noted by Reimu that she tends to have bad luck.

===Personality===
She doesn't have a very proactive personality, but rather always walks her own path. However, she's always interested where knowledge is concerned and will proactively go and try to acquire it. She does everything by the book, but still makes a lot of mistakes. She's also described as very dark and taciturn, which in this case means she is introverted and silent in expression and manner.

===Abilities===
;:&lt;nowiki&gt;Ability: Manipulation of fire, water, wood, metal, earth, sun, and moon&lt;/nowiki&gt; 
Patchouli manipulates the five Chinese elements, making her an "Eastern style Western magician", an antithesis existence to [[Marisa Kirisame]]: "Western style Eastern magician". Patchouli is able to handle the five phases (commonly called [[wikipedia:Wu Xing|Wu Xing]], sometimes known as the five elements) with the addition of the sun and moon elements. The order of elements she uses follows the [[wikipedia:Days of the week#East Asian Seven Luminaries|days of the week on a Japanese calendar]]. Due to this, she's known as the "one-week girl".&lt;ref&gt;[[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]] omake.txt&lt;/ref&gt; In the Japanese language, the weekdays are named after the [[wikipedia:Classical planet|classical planets]], which in turn were named after the Wu Xing phases (e.g. Mercury, ''water'' star), plus the Sun and Moon as heavenly bodies. As this ordering is based on the [[wikipedia:Planetary hours|planetary hours]], there is no direct relationship between the weekdays and Wu Xing. The ordering of Patchouli's elements follows the weekday sequence, but places the ''Wu Xing'' phases first and "Sun" and "Moon" last.

{{nihongo|Elemental magic|属性魔法}} (also {{nihongo|spiritual magic|精霊魔法}}) borrows the powers of spirits that exist in nature.&lt;ref name="PMiSSPatche"&gt;[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]: [[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Patchouli Knowledge|Patchouli Knowledge]]&lt;/ref&gt; Through this, she's able to receive great output from a small input. Since the Wu Xing elements interact with each other, she can combine them and multiply their power, but this runs the risk of weakening the overall effect unless the elements are precisely controlled. When she confronts enemies that likewise use elemental magic, then the interactions of Wu Xing would imply that she can somehow effectively use her own magic and somehow inhibit the opponent's magic.

[[File:GoMIllus-Patchouli.jpg|thumb|192px|Patchouli using the [[spell card]] ''Fire Water Wood Metal Earth Sign "Philosopher's Stone"'', as illustrated in ''[[The Grimoire of Marisa]]''.]]

Since the Wu Xing elements could be said to exist in living things, she touched upon them for characters who showed up in ''[[Immaterial and Missing Power]]''. For example, [[Marisa Kirisame]] is associated with the element "water" according to Patchouli.&lt;ref&gt;[[Immaterial and Missing Power/Story/Patchouli's Script]]&lt;/ref&gt; Given Marisa's last name (Kirisame, meaning "drizzle"), her black clothing, her lack of yang (due to living in the [[Forest of Magic]]), and her "Cold Inferno" shot in ''[[Mountain of Faith]]'', this makes sense.

She uses [[spell card]]s that combine multiple elements. In addition to using combinations with good compatibility such as ''Earth &amp; Metal Sign "Emerald Megalith"'', she also uses combinations with poor compatibility such as ''Water &amp; Fire Sign "Phlogistic Rain"''. Sun and moon are not within Wu Xing, but they're classically opposite to each other, and these two have been combined with each other in ''Sun &amp; Moon Sign "Royal Diamond Ring"''. In ''[[Shoot the Bullet]]'', she devised new experimental magic that combined elements with poor compatibility. With a large diversity of element combinations, she can do many things, such as increasing her power or covering her weaknesses.&lt;ref name="PMiSSPatche" /&gt; As of now, among the Wu Xing, the only combination that hasn't appeared is wood &amp; earth.

While she's capable of using advanced magic with great power, her poor health, asthma, and anemia limits her ability to use it. During ''[[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]]'', she says "I can't finish reciting the spells because of my anemia!" and her condition limited her to using two-element spells. On another day, her asthma wasn't as bad and she felt better, so she was able to cast three advanced spells in a row: a sun, a moon, and a five-element spell.

Fitting her magic to the same attributes as the days of the week is her secret hobby, but nobody has realized this.&lt;ref&gt;[[Immaterial and Missing Power]] [[Shanghai Alice Correspondence]]&lt;/ref&gt; Thanks to this, she doesn't mistake the day of the week, but oddly enough she doesn't have a good sense of the date.

In ''Embodiment of Scarlet Devil'', she had the peculiarity of using different spell cards depending on the player's character and shot type (a recurring gimmick in many stage 4 bosses of the Touhou games). Other than spell cards, she's able to use a revolving laser that focuses on herself as her regular [[danmaku]].

===Possessions===
Patchouli has many books in the library of the Scarlet Devil Mansion which are mostly used for magic. Some of these books appear to act "independently" and can shoot [[danmaku]], as shown in Stage 4 and the Extra stage of ''[[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]]''. She also has waterproof books that Marisa finds interest in reading in the bath.&lt;ref&gt;[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody/Story/Marisa's Script#Marisa Wins Patchouli]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character Design==
[[File:PMiSS patchouli.jpg|thumb|192px|Patchouli as illustrated in ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'']]
===Name===
Her full name is {{nihongo|''Patchouli Knowledge''|パチュリー・ノーレッジ}}. Her first name {{nihongo||パチュリー|Patchouli}} is a name of a plant of the Lamiaceae family, or the essential oil or perfume that could be made from it (originally from Tamil language). Her last name, {{nihongo||ノーレッジ|Knowledge}}, appears to reference to her learned, scholarly nature, though few other characters seem to have such literal surnames. The middle dot ({{lang|ja|・}}) in the middle of her name is used in foreign names to show where the next word begins. In the data files for ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'', her first name was romanised as "Pachouly".

A canon nickname, used for her by [[Remilia Scarlet]], is {{nihongo|"Pache"|パチェ}}, but "Patchy" is more commonly used in the English-speaking community.

===Design===
Shown in various works, her hair and eyes are purple, and has many ribbons tied to her hair and other parts of her clothing. She wears pink pajama-like clothing and a night-cap with a gold crescent moon on it, which [[ZUN]] says is her daily wear. Apparently, her dress looks like it has stripes of purple and violet. But according to [[ZUN]], it's in fact ''not'' a stripe. This was confirmed in a talk of him and [[Twilight Frontier]]. In this talk, it says that even though they had acknowledged it by a material handed by ZUN, she ended up having a striped pattern in ''[[Immaterial and Missing Power]]'' for some reason. A conversation quoted from the talk: ZUN "Patchouli doesn't have any stripes." Twilight Frontier staff "Everybody thinks Patchouli has stripes except ZUN-san."&lt;ref&gt;[http://dic.pixiv.net/a/パチュリー・ノーレッジ {{lang|ja|パチュリー・ノーレッジ 【ピクシブ百科事典】}}] her article on pixiv Encyclopedia.&lt;/ref&gt;

Her alternative outfit in ''[[Immaterial and Missing Power]]'' and ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]'' is mostly lavender while her hair is a darker shade of violet.

In ''[[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]]'', Patchouli attempts to stop the player from going further into the [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]], but has trouble as her anemia is preventing her from casting spells properly. Later on, when [[Flandre Scarlet]] gets out of the basement while [[Remilia Scarlet]] is away, she casts a rain spell around the mansion to prevent her from leaving. When the player returns, she challenges them again, this time with more powerful magic as she happens to be feeling better.

In ''[[Immaterial and Missing Power]]'', Patchouli decides to investigate the strange events herself after shooing [[Marisa Kirisame]] out of the library. Before leaving, she puts [[Sakuya Izayoi]] in charge of keeping an eye on things. As soon as she leaves, she runs into [[Alice Margatroid]], who's also investigating, and defeats her. From there, she makes her way to the [[Netherworld]], where after beating [[Youmu Konpaku]], she interrogates [[Yuyuko Saigyouji]]. Unfortunately, the ghost doesn't know anything either, but implies that [[Yukari Yakumo]] might. After fighting her at the [[Hakurei Shrine]] for a bit, [[Suika Ibuki]] finally decides to make herself known.

Patchouli made a background cameo appearance in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'' on the [[Hakurei Shrine]] stage. She is seen sitting on a chair with [[Remilia Scarlet]] under a tree, reading a book.

===Literature===
[[File:OSPPatchouli.png|thumb|150px|Patchouli's appearance in ''[[Oriental Sacred Place]]'' chapter 15]]
;Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red
Patchouli appears in an article where she decides to organize a setsubun festival at the [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]], though summer is already approaching. She claims that the word "setsubun" originally means "interval between seasons", so there should be no problem having it at that time rather than between winter and spring, when it's usually held. However, it being an outside-world holiday, Patchouli is unclear on a lot of the details. [[Aya Shameimaru]] interviews her afterwards, and she says that she's generally happy with how it turned out, though she did need to forbid the [[Fairy Maid]]s from throwing beans around in her library. They also discuss the [[oni]], and their inherent weaknesses.

;Silent Sinner in Blue
Patchouli is the main force behind the research and design of the rocket that [[Remilia Scarlet]], [[Reimu Hakurei]], [[Marisa Kirisame]], and [[Sakuya Izayoi]] use to reach the [[Moon]]. However, she cannot create the rocket fuel, so she decides to get Reimu to help by using her powers. She also remains behind as the navigator as the rocket travels to the Moon.

;Strange and Bright Nature Deity
Patchouli appears in a couple of chapters of ''[[Strange and Bright Nature Deity]]'' in the Scarlet Devil Mansion arc, where she enjoys a few meals with Sakuya and Remilia as the new year comes.

;Oriental Sacred Place
Patchouli also appears in chapter 15 in ''[[Oriental Sacred Place]]'', stumbling around her library for research materials. She leaves herself and goes to the shrine to recover some stolen books. The book in question had its seal unlocked, but no one knows by whom. In the meantime, the [[Three Fairies of Light]] sneak in and grab a few books and take them back home, later discovering that they're unable to read them at all.
;Foul Detective Satori
As a member of the scarlet mist incident, she was the first victim of [[Mizuchi Miyadeguchi]], who put her in to a coma. She was initially convinced that [[Sakuya Izayoi]] poisioned her, however, after an investigation by [[Satori]] and [[Rin Kaenbyou]] they discovered that this was the work of [[Mizuchi]].

Later on, she guessed what Satori was thinking using natural methods.

==Relationships==
===Residents of the Scarlet Devil Mansion===
Patchouli Knowledge is [[Remilia Scarlet]]'s old friend.&lt;ref&gt;Relationship flowcharts in ''[[Silent Sinner in Blue]]'' say Patchouli is an "old friend" of Remilia's&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]'', they called each other {{nihongo|"Remi"|レミィ}} and {{nihongo|"Pache"|パチェ}} respectively. The two have been depicted having tea and casual conversations together in ''[[Silent Sinner in Blue]]'' and ''[[Oriental Sacred Place]]'', where Patchouli offhandedly commented that they're both creatures of the night. As stated in ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'', Patchouli's role at the mansion is to solve problems and to cause them. Patchouli will often volunteer her services when she sees Remilia in need of them.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil/Translation/Extra Story|Embodiment of Scarlet Devil: Extra Story]]'': Patchouli caused a localised rainstorm to keep Flandre confined to the mansion.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Imperishable Night]]'' Ending 3: Patchouli helps Remilia in planning a trip to the moon.&lt;/ref&gt;

Patchouli is unlikely to be formally employed by Remilia. [[Sakuya Izayoi]] referred to Patchouli as "The Mistress's magician friend" while talking to [[Rinnosuke Morichika]] about her.&lt;ref&gt;[[Curiosities of Lotus Asia/Chapter_18|Curiosities of Lotus Asia Chapter 18]] "The Mistress's magician friend said 'I have enough of the ingredients,'"&lt;/ref&gt;, as opposed to any sort of employee title. She is referred to as Remilia's friend in other materials, as well.

The head maid [[Sakuya Izayoi]] is occasionally seen serving Patchouli. Patchouli tends to be rather sarcastic and condescending with her and [[Hong Meiling]], but seems to appreciate her, as she always remembers to thank Sakuya for tea or for completion of other jobs. With Meiling however, she tends to tell her to read books as to improve her brain. [[Koakuma]] is an employee of Scarlet Devil Mansion seen working in the library; any dialogue interactions between the two are unknown.

Not much is known about the relationship between Patchouli and [[Flandre Scarlet]]. Patchouli is aware of Flandre's existence and the need to keep her confined to the mansion, as Remilia noted Patchouli was probably causing a rainstorm around the mansion to keep Flandre from getting out.

===Marisa Kirisame===
[[Marisa Kirisame]] is a thief who steals books from the library of the Scarlet Devil Mansion. She states that she's only borrowing but Patchouli reacts by telling Marisa in ''Oriental Sacred Place'' that she has no intention to lend Marisa books in a rather serious tone.&lt;ref&gt;[[Oriental Sacred Place]] Chapter 15&lt;/ref&gt; However, she's one of three people who assists Marisa during ''[[Subterranean Animism]]'''s events, showing some sort of affinity despite Patchouli having her own agenda. Marisa has copied Patchouli's regular danmaku attack and named it Love Sign "Non-directional Laser", used as her normal B-type bomb in ''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]'' and as a spell card in ''[[Imperishable Night]]'' and other games.

==Spell Cards==
With the exception of her story cards Sign I "St. Elmo's Explosion" and Sign II "Forty-Day Deluge" in ''[[Immaterial and Missing Power]]'', whose prefixes are patterned in the style of other cards in that game, all of Patchouli's spell names are prefixed with one or more of the kanji for the seven elements she manipulates. The longest of these is {{Nihongo|Fire Water Wood Metal Earth Sign "Philosopher's Stone"|火水木金土符「賢者の石」|Ka-sui-moku-kin-do-fu "Kenja no Ishi"}}.

==Additional Information==
*Patchouli often refers to the science and technology of the [[Outside World|outside world]] as magic. This is actually not ignorance, but more due to her personal beliefs, as she tells [[Marisa Kirisame]] in her ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]'' victory quote that science and magic are the same.
*In ''[[Immaterial and Missing Power]]'', Patchouli refers to intruders/thieves (e.g., [[Marisa Kirisame]]) as "rats" and guards (e.g., [[Sakuya Izayoi]] and [[Hong Meiling]]) as "cats". She rates the catness/effectiveness of a guard on a scale of 1 to 96, because that's the highest number under 100 that is divisible by both 2 and 3. After defeating Sakuya in ''[[Immaterial and Missing Power]]'', she gave her a rating of 24. As for Hong Meiling, Patchouli compares that cat to a sieve in her ''Immaterial and Missing Power'' victory quote.
*The crescent on Patchouli's hat could be the crescent in the Sanskrit "Hum", part of the Mantra [[wikipedia:Om mani padme hum|"Om mani padme hum"]]. In Buddhism, it stands for knowledge and purity and is associated with the color white—all the 7 colors combined.
*As of ''[[Double Spoiler]]'', Patchouli has had appearances in 9 of the 13 [[Windows]] games (counting ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]'' as a standalone). This makes her the third most featured character, behind [[Reimu Hakurei]] and Marisa.
*In ''Touhou Hisoutensoku'', one of Patchouli's alternate colors resembles [[Hina Kagiyama]]'s outfit.
*The books in Patchouli's spell card, [[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil/Spell Cards/Extra#Spell Card 54|Fire Water Wood Metal Earth Sign "Philosopher's Stone"]], are arranged in a similar way to the [[Five Magic Stones]].
*It's suggested in ''Immaterial and Missing Power'' that Patchouli drinks coffee occasionally when she's studying, unlike the other residents of [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]] who almost always drink tea.
*The rhythm of Patchouli's theme ''Locked Girl ~ The Girl's Sealed Room'', when converted into morse code ("・－・・ －－－ ・・・－ ・"), spells "love".  This is referenced in the title of a cover of the song by ShibayanRecords on the album ''Magico Catastrofe''.&lt;ref name="ShibayanRecords: Magico Catastrofe Track 08"&gt;[[ShibayanRecords]], [[Magico Catastrofe]], [[Lyrics: ・－・・ －－－ ・・・－ ・|Track 08]].&lt;/ref&gt;
*Unofficially, [[Patchouli Knowledge]]'s library has often been called "Voile" based on its [[Voile, the Magic Library|stage theme]]. However, based on an erratum for ''[[Eastern and Little Nature Deity]]'' correcting the name of Patchouli's library from {{nihongo|"Voile, the Magic Library"|ヴワル図書館}} to {{nihongo|"a library inside the Scarlet Devil Mansion"|紅魔館内の図書館}},&lt;ref&gt;Ichijinsha Webpage - [http://www.comptiq.com/release/comic/55touhou_owabi.html the list of errata] (''[[Eastern and Little Nature Deity]]'')&lt;/ref&gt; the name "Voile" is not considered canon.
*Shibata Masahiro's manga series "[https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/manga.php?id=1648 Sarai]" seems to be a big inspiration for many of the characters from EoSD . Sarai is a manga about superpowered maids fighting youkai and monsters in a dystopian future. The series was published from 1997 to 2007 in Japan only.
**Patchouli shares the same name with [https://onsen.touhouwiki.net/wiki/File:Patchouli_seal.jpg Patchouli Seal] from Sarai.

'''The Girl of Knowledge and Shade'''&lt;br/&gt;
'''Patchouli Knowledge'''

Ability: Manipulating fire, water, wood, metal, earth, sun, and moon 

The 4th stage boss. She is the friend of the [[Remilia Scarlet|young mistress]] and is a witch who has lived for 100 years. The "One-week Girl".

Her weak constitution makes her poor at physical combat, but she makes up for for that with her various and powerful magical attacks. Patchouli's ribbon is not a holy charm, but rather an accessory that boosts magic power.

As a genuine witch, she possesses terrifying sorcerous powers. However, due to her natural asthma, she has difficulty reciting her incantations to the end. She also seems to have a vitamin A deficiency.

Maybe her windowless library room is dusty. No, obviously, it's very dusty. But with all the time she spends near her books, she feels that they're a part of her and cannot stand to be separated from them. She's lived this way for a hundred years or so.

Total of twenty-one card attacks.

'''The Unmoving Great Library, Patchouli Knowledge'''&lt;br/&gt;
Species: Witch&lt;br/&gt;
Residence: Scarlet Devil Mansion&lt;br/&gt;
Ability: Handling magic (mainly elemental magic)

A witch who has settled down in the [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]]. Unlike the [[Remilia Scarlet|mistress]] of the house, she is not weak against sunlight; however, she does not go out much. She spends her days in a library where the sunlight cannot reach. This is so that the books won't be damaged, but the unhealthy atmosphere is bad for her health.

She doesn't have a very proactive personality, but rather always walks her own path. However, she is always interested where knowledge is concerned and will proactively go and try to acquire it.  She does everything by the book, but still makes a lot of mistakes.

Although she is quite skillful, her complete lack of physical fighting ability can't be helped. She pretty much never attempts to directly punch or kick her opponent. She makes up for this with her knowledge of a great variety of powerful magic. She's more at ease using magic than trying to attack physically. Dividing the magic she uses according to the days of the week is a secret hobby of hers, but no one has realized this.

Patchouli Knowledge

Species: magician&lt;br/&gt;
Ability: The ability to use magic.

A magician living in Scarlet Devil Manor.

She noticed a great number of earth spirits welling up from the geyser.
On close inspection, these earth spirits looked just like phantoms, but they were actually vengeful spirits, a slightly different variety. Unlike phantoms, vengeful spirits bear grudges against the world. They were a threat to humans, youkai, and fairies alike.

Although she wanted to take her time to look for a book on vengeful spirits, it would have been quite dangerous if no one were to check on the geyser. Frustrated, Patchouli went to consult Yukari. Yukari, who was also surprised by the state of affairs, devised a plan to get the humans to explore the underworld.

}}{{Uwabami note}}
This character was found at the [[Twilight Bar Room]] and is the third stage midboss of ''[[Uwabami Breakers]]'' at the bar "Saturday Night Garden". He(?) attacked [[Isami Asama]] as she flies around drunk by throwing hundreds of knifes at her (in reference to [[Sakuya Izayoi]]?) in a circular manner before the the final [[boss]] [[Amakasu Barley Tenji]] appears. While he's shooting a load of knifes, he leaves a small gap in front of him to allow Isami easily dodge the knifes. Nothing else is known about this character except that he's a reference to the classic Japanese children's game ''[[wikipedia:Pop-up Pirate|Pop-up Pirate]]''.

==Background Information==
His sprite shows a pirate sticking out of a barrel which has "BEER" written on it with a [[wikipedia:Beer tap|beer tap]] and four knives sticking out. In the data files, the name for his sprite is {{nihongo|"beertaru"|ビール樽}}, which translates to "beer barrel".

The {{nihongo|'''Prismriver Sisters'''|プリズムリバー三姉妹|Purizumuribaa San-shimai}} are three [[characters]] named [[Lunasa Prismriver]], [[Merlin Prismriver]] and [[Lyrica Prismriver]], together appearing as the [[stage]] 4 [[boss]] of ''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]''. Lunasa, Merlin, and Lyrica are collectively called the "Prismriver Ensemble" and perform at parties and festivals. At first sight, their instruments (Lunasa with the violin, Merlin with the trumpet, and Lyrica with the keyboard) may seem scattered and disconnected, but they still perform magnificent music. There is also a fourth Prismriver sister, named [[Layla Prismriver]].

==General Information==
These three sisters are [[poltergeist]]s, made by [[Layla Prismriver]] to have the appearances and personalities of her three older sisters from whom she had been separated. Thus, they are technically all the same age since they were presumably created at the same time. They only act out the roles of oldest, middle, and youngest sister based on whichever one they were made to resemble.

It is known, based on their official profiles and from comments by [[Eiki Shiki, Yamaxanadu|Eiki]], that none of the original four sisters are still alive today. However, it's unknown how long ago the events that spawned these three poltergeists occurred.

===Ability===
;Performing on musical instruments without hands or feet
In ''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]'', this is the main ability that all three sisters have been specified to have. This probably derives from the ability [[poltergeist]]s have, put to specific use in performing with musical instruments. By manipulating the spirits of instruments, they're able to manipulate the spirits of notes to create sounds. Since they needn't have direct contact with the instruments, they're able to play music impossible to play by hand.

Since the three sisters' musical performance is something that they have learned themselves after Layla's death, their previous abilities were probably along the lines of "moving things without hands or feet" or "making sounds without hands or feet". The former is because poltergeists in general can move things and make them float. The latter is because in the general phenomena of poltergeists, they can be heard from anywhere (a rapping noise, for example).

===Name===
Sometimes "Prismriver" is translated as {{nihongo||虹川|niji-kawa}}, which means "rainbow river", even though "rainbow" does not mean "prism". Thus, Layla and her sisters are sometimes referred to as the {{nihongo|"niji-kawa sisters"|虹川三姉妹}}.
&lt;!-- PLEASE TRANSLATE THE FOLLOWING TEXT, WHICH IS FROM http://www.toho-motoneta.net/index.php?%A5%D7%A5%EA%A5%BA%A5%E0%A5%EA%A5%D0%A1%BC%BB%B0%BB%D0%CB%E5#c9d8eb2f

    プリズム(prism)
        古代ギリシャ語のπρισμα（削られたもの）が語源。
        角柱。
        よく磨かれた平面をもつ透明な多面体で、光を分散・屈折・全反射させるために用いるもの。
        材質はアクリル、ガラス、水晶など多彩。三角柱状のものが最もポピュラー。
            合奏系のスペカで三角になるものがあるのもここから？
        無色透明な角柱が分光効果を示すことは古代ギリシャから知られていた。
        当時はアクリルは元より無色透明なガラスの製法も確立していなかったため、
        水晶などの無色透明な結晶を削ったものが用いられた。
        （欧州で無色透明なガラスの製法が確立したのは1450年頃）

備考

    crystal river
        水晶のように輝く命の水の川（ヨハネの黙示録22章1節）
        最後の審判後に現れる新しい神の都の中央を流れている川。
            有名な童謡「たぬきの金時計」の元歌の元ネタである賛美歌「まもなくかなたの」はこの節からの着想。
            死後の神の都における友人や家族などとの再会について歌っている。--&gt;

'''Three Poltergeist Sisters'''&lt;br /&gt;
'''Eldest Sister: Lunasa Prismriver'''&lt;br /&gt;
'''Middle Sister: Merlin Prismriver'''&lt;br /&gt;
'''Youngest Sister: Lyrica Prismriver'''

Stage 4 boss, a musical performance group as poltergeists. Noisiness &lt;span style="white-space: nowrap;"&gt;times 3&lt;/span&gt;. They have the ability to perform with instruments without hands and feet&amp;mdash;&lt;span style="white-space: nowrap;"&gt;times 3&lt;/span&gt;.

The Saigyouji family enlisted the Prismriver sisters to provide music at a convention, promising them a flower-viewing in return. The three of them are always summoned to banquets and such; their music stirs things up. They're like phantomic versions of publicity-generating cultural icons.

This time, the Saigyouji family is holding an extravagant flower-viewing festival, so they would naturally be invited.

Lunasa is an honour student type who excels at everything she does. She hates cheating, and confronts all challenges with fairness and great strength.

She does what she has to do but her personality is somewhat dark on the outside. Furthermore, her honesty makes her easy to deceive.

She is most skilled with stringed instruments, especially violins. She usually prefers solo performances.

She is very skilled with all kinds of instruments, but usually works with either keyboards or percussion.

The three of them were born long ago. At that time, there was a [[human]] noble, Count Prismriver. The Count had four daughters, whom he cherished.

However, due to an unfortunate accident, the four daughters were orphaned. Without any other relatives, each daughter went her own separate way. The fourth daughter, [[Layla Prismriver|Layla]], was unable to leave the mansion that held so many of her memories. Using her strongest power, she conjured [[poltergeist]]s with the appearance of her older sisters, then vanished along with the mansion and the poltergeists.

Time moved on, and the death of the four people from those old days came to pass; the [[Ruined Western Mansion|poltergeists' mansion]] remained in [[Gensokyo]]. The three poltergeist sisters continue their noisy lives in that mansion to this day.

The musical performances given by those three, at various places of announcement, a fusion of casual rhythm and classical instruments, are loved by the inhabitants of the cheerful [[Netherworld]]. Yet, the performance itself provides no additional effect, and does not heal.

'''Project Characters''' is a [[Touhou Wiki:Projects|Touhou Wiki Project]] formed to better organize the writing and editing of any articles pertaining to [[Characters|characters]] featured in official [[Touhou Project]] games. If you would like to help, feel free to ask any questions on the [[Touhou Wiki talk:Project Characters|talk page]] and check out the [[Touhou Wiki:Project Characters#To-do list|to-do list]] on this page.

For a complete list of pages that are currently part of Project Characters, please use the "What links here" option in the Toolbox, or just click [http://en.touhouwiki.net/index.php?title=Special:WhatLinksHere/Touhou_Wiki:Project_Characters&amp;limit=500 here].

==Project Characters==

===Scope and aims===

'''Project Characters''' covers all articles regarding official [[Touhou Project]] characters, including, but not limited to, the characters' actual profile pages. It's goal is to ensure that all information is up-to-date, stubs are filled in with information, and the information is presented in a standard format(shown below).

All character articles should be in [[Category:Characters]] as well. The main character listing page is [[Characters]].

===Participants===

To join this project, just place your name at the bottom of the list. As the community is rather small in the first place, it's not mandatory to place your name here, but it will aid newcomers in finding people to ask about things related to character page editing.

* [[User:IbarakiIbuki|Ibaraki Ibuki]]
* [[User:Nazeo|Nazeo]]
* [[User:Quwanti|Quwanti]]
* [[User:Tony64|Tony64]]
* [[User:Eluthena|Eluthena]]

==Structure==

If you would like to just start by looking at a page whose structure is in line with the editing standards for character pages, take a look at [[Fujiwara no Mokou]]'s page. Most of the relevant headers are contained in the article. Otherwise, please look at [[Touhou Wiki:Guidelines/Standardization of Character Pages]] for more details.

Of particular note are the characters infobox, which comes at the top of each page, and the ordering of the sections, which differs from many character articles at the current time.

To indicate that an article is part of Project Characters, please place the following template at the bottom of the page, but above any group boxes(such as the character list box), using the following code.
&lt;pre&gt;{{Project Characters Notice}}&lt;/pre&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Raiko Horikawa'''|堀川 雷鼓|Horikawa Raiko}} is a [[tsukumogami]], transformed from a taiko drum. She appears in ''[[Double Dealing Character]]'' as the Extra Stage boss.

==General Information==
Though originally born as a tsukumogami from a taiko drum, Raiko now borrows the "magic energy" of modern drummers from the outside world, which is why she uses a modern-day drumset.

===Personality===
In all of Raiko's dialogue, she seems to simply want to be free. She seems laid-back and doesn't think much of stealing magic from the outside world. At the end of the Extra Stage, she makes friends with the main character, so she has no real ill intent, though she insists on keeping her freedom to make some noise during concerts.

==Backstory==
Raiko was born from a taiko drum that had become a tsukumogami through age, but because she was frequently used and enjoyed use, she wasn't a vengeful tsukumogami. During the events of Double Dealing Character, Raiko noticed a strange power enter her body and a desire for revenge against those who used her. Despite her ferocity, Raiko soon realized that the new power she felt was from [[Shinmyoumaru Sukuna]]'s use of the Miracle Mallet and that it would not last forever. Fearing that she would lose her newfound freedom when she ran out of power, she quickly worked to finding a suitable replacement for it. 

Taking a rather large risk, she abandoned her old taiko drum for a new drum kit and drummer, cleansing her body of the Miracle Mallet's power and making her self-sufficient while claiming that her new power is from magicians who live in the outside world. She taught this method to the other temporarily empowered tools, such as [[Benben Tsukumo]] and [[Yatsuhashi Tsukumo]], ensuring that they would be able to keep their freedom when the Miracle Mallet's power dissipated. 

Since then, she has supposedly been working with her fellow tsukumogami to create a paradise for tools to live freely.

==Character Design==
===Name===
Her surname Horikawa literally means "moat &amp; river". The theme ZUN implies with this is uncertain. There is "The Drum of the Waves of Horikawa" ({{lang|ja|堀川波鼓}}), a [[Wikipedia:Jōruri_(music)|joururi]] play composed by [[Wikipedia:Chikamatsu_Monzaemon|Monzaemon Chikamatsu]], the theme of which is the husband's "revenge" against his wife and another man in sexual dalliance. It is also probable that according to [[Wikipedia:Otogizōshi|Otogi-zoushi]]'s "Issunboushi," Horikawa is the surname of Issunboushi, whose offspring was Shinmyoumaru and empowered Raiko to first take action.

Her given name, Raiko, is made up of the kanji for "thunder" and "drum". The kanji used for "Japanese percussion" (鼓) is also the second kanji in the word "taiko" ({{lang|ja|太鼓}}). "Raiko" is a set of percussions carried by [[Wikipedia:Raijin|Raijin]] on the back, it is used for "lightning" or "thunder" — the brutal air pressure and sudden loud noise of thunder might remind people of bass drum.

===Design===
In [[Double_Dealing_Character|Double Dealing Character]]'s official art, Raiko Horikawa is seen with short, wavy red hair, red eyes, and a black shirt with red cross-hatching that is tucked into a short, white skirt. She also wears a small purple tie with a white upside-down cross on it, and a white sport coat with long sleeves. She has black-purple shoes with red lacing and large drum mallets on the back of them. Raiko is also shown sitting on her magical drums, which are red decorated with white flower patterns. The floor tom is notably detached from the rest of the drum set.

==Appearances==
;''Double Dealing Character''
[[File:Th14RaikoSprite.png|frame|Raiko's sprite in ''DDC'']]
:{{Main|Double_Dealing_Character/Story/Reimu A's_Extra|l1=Reimu A Arc|Double_Dealing_Character/Story/Reimu B's_Extra|l2=Reimu B Arc}}
When Reimu finds Raiko in the storm, she explains how she was born as a tsukumogami under the Miracle Mallet's power, but managed to change her own power source. She decides to fight Reimu in order to test it out. After being defeated, she explains a little more about the magic behind tsukumogamis (and tools in general), and Reimu, somewhat sympathizing with her plight, says she won't hunt tools and lets her off.
:{{Main|Double_Dealing_Character/Story/Marisa A's_Extra|l1=Marisa A Arc}}
Marisa is greatly surprised at the kind of magical expertise Raiko must have to change out her own source of energy. Raiko explains a bit about how it happens, and Marisa lets her go after she promises not to harm humans, and then leaves to fix her own Mini-Hakkero.
:{{Main|Double_Dealing_Character/Story/Marisa B's_Extra|l1=Marisa B Arc}}
Marisa attacks Raiko, as her Mini-Hakkero moving on its own has caused her no end of trouble. After Raiko is defeated, Marisa lets her go, insisting that she has no desire for the outside world's magic. Raiko explains that the tool depends on the user: if the user is wicked, then the tool will be, as well. Marisa takes it to heart.
:{{Main|Double_Dealing_Character/Story/Sakuya A's_Extra|l1=Sakuya A Arc}}
Sakuya approaches Raiko with her blade in hand, to try and get rid of both problems at once. However, Raiko has already changed her power source and is looking to test it out. After being defeated, she notes that the blade seems to like its "suffering", and offers to show Sakuya how to imbue it with more magic power. The maid refuses, though, as she is worried that if the blade became a tsukumogami, it would be far too strong.
:{{Main|Double_Dealing_Character/Story/Sakuya B's_Extra|l1=Sakuya B Arc}}
When Sakuya meets Raiko in the middle of the storm, the maid offers to remove the magic power and revert her to being a tool. Raiko has other plans, and does battle with Sakuya in order to test her new energy source. After noting that while mere tools can float in and out between Gensokyo and the real world all the time, a tsukumogami might not follow the same rules, Sakuya offers again, and Raiko turns her down.

===Spin-offs===
[[File:Th155Raiko.png|100px|thumb|right|Raiko's cameo in ''AoCF'']]
;''Impossible Spell Card''
:{{Main|Impossible Spell Card#Story|l1=Impossible Spell Card: Story}}
Raiko appeared once again in Impossible Spell Card to confront the on-the-run [[amanojaku]], [[Seija Kijin]]. Her goal was to stop Seija from abusing the power of the Miracle Mallet as well as abusing the many tools and items she was using to cheat her way through spell cards.

;''Antinomy of Common Flowers''
She is seen with the Prismrivers as a cameo at the Concert Stage of the Sun.

===Literature===

;Alternative Facts in Eastern Utopia
After publishing that the Prismriver threesome disbanded due to "creative differences," [[Aya Shameimaru]] shortly published another story reporting that the band had reformed—this time as a quartet, the fourth member being Raiko.

Afterwards, Aya interviews Raiko asking about the disband and Raiko claims that those "creative differences" only existed partially, and that she knew the band needed percussion. Also, she added that the negotiations with the Prismriver sisters had been going on since before the article and that they didn't want to break apart, but use the news to attract more public.

==Relationships==
===[[Benben Tsukumo|Benben]] and [[Yatsuhashi Tsukumo]]===
Raiko was the one who told the Tsukumo sisters how to convert their energy source away from the Mallet's power. Not much is said about their relationship otherwise, though, aside from Raiko looking out for people that were the same as her.

===[[Prismriver Sisters]]===
As of [[Alternative Facts in Eastern Utopia]], Raiko Horikawa is a member of the Prismriver Sisters band, the first member outside of the Prismriver family.

===Minor Relationships===
;[[Reimu Hakurei]], [[Marisa Kirisame]], and [[Sakuya Izayoi]]
After battling the heroine, Raiko almost invariably becomes friendly with her. They promise not to exterminate her and generally to let her be, even when she puts on a live concert.

==Additional Information==
*The symbol on the smaller drums is [[wikipedia:Tomoe|Mitsudomoe]]. Mitsudomoe are believed to represent the three primary divisions in Shinto, which are "man", "Earth", and "sky", and they are also associated with the lightning god [[wikipedia:Raijin|Raijin]].
*The hexagonal drum pads are reminiscient of the [[wikipedia:Simmons SDS-V|Simmons SDS-V]], the first commercially available electronic drum kit and popular in the 1980s.
*Raiko's [[Spell Card]]s "Blue Lady Show" and "Pristine Beat" shoot danmaku as to follow a rhythm, creating a melody out of it. The shot rate is only slightly slower than the beat rate of her own theme.

Horikawa Raiko

Species: Tsukumogami&lt;br /&gt;
Ability: Capable of making anything follow a rhythm

She's a tsukumogami created from a Japanese taiko drum.&lt;br /&gt;
She lived for a while, feeling joy when struck by people.

However, she began to feel a strong, new magical power within her.&lt;br /&gt;
At the same time, ferocity flared up in her mind.&lt;br /&gt;
"Now is the time for the tools to take revenge," she thought.

She was wise, though, and quickly realized that this power&lt;br /&gt;
was that of an oni (i.e. that of the Miracle Mallet).

She felt that at this rate, she'd be completely taken over by it.

She took a big gamble.&lt;br /&gt;
She threw away the taiko drums that made up her body, and the drummer that held the magic power,&lt;br /&gt;
and sought a new magic power of her own. This was in the forbidden outside world, as well.

Thus, she obtained a new drum kit, and a new drummer as well.&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks to the outside world's magic power, obviously.


None of the oni's power is left in her body any more.&lt;br /&gt;
Even if the Miracle Mallet enters its reabsorption period, she won't turn back into a regular tool.

She taught this method to the other tsukumogami around her.

Even if we're tools, we want to have fun of our own will!&lt;br /&gt;
Now, shall we go build a paradise for tools?

{{nihongo|'''Ran Yakumo'''|八雲　藍|Yakumo Ran}} is the [[kitsune]] [[shikigami]] of [[Yukari Yakumo]] and the master of the [[bakeneko]] shikigami [[Chen]].

==General Information==
Ran first appeared as the extra stage boss of ''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]'' and then as the Phantasm stage midboss in the same game. She has a strong midboss image, but even as an extra boss, she demonstrated abilities that were nothing to be ashamed of through a long and difficult battle.

She frequently appears as an attack option in the fighting games for Yukari, and appeared in ''[[Imperishable Night]]'' as part of Yukari's shot.

===Personality===
Ran is described as being a gentle youkai who won't start a fight unless provoked. Although Ran is a shikigami, she sometimes "forgets" her position as a servant and acts of her own volition, such as deciding to attack the heroine in ''Perfect Cherry Blossom'' to avenge Chen. Because of this, Yukari punished Ran to remind her who the master is.

===Abilities===
;Using Shikigami
She has the privilege of strong [[youkai]] being able to use [[shikigami]] while also being a shikigami herself. However, Chen has the same level of wisdom that a child does, perhaps because Ran does not have the level of power that Yukari has, or perhaps because Ran's own power of turning youkai into a medium wasn't enough. Also, although she's not able to go against what Yukari says, this doesn't mean that Chen perfectly listens to what Ran says. Because of this, she sometimes has to lure Chen with catnip to make her listen.

;Clear intellect
She has super-human intellect equal to Yukari's, and excels at mathematics. According to ''[[Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red]]'', she was somehow able to formulate and prove an equation for figuring out the width of the [[Sanzu River]]. It seems to be her specialty to process formulated calculations than invent new things through her intellect. At this point, the shikigami of [[Gensokyo]] have been often likened to the PCs of the [[Outside World|outside world]].

;Miscellaneous
[[Shoot_the_Bullet/Spell_Cards/Level_8#Spell_Card_8_-_7|One of her spellcards]] shows that she is capable of quickly increasing her physical capabilities, but other than this, nothing else about her other abilities have really come to light. She's likely able to use various other kinds of sorcery as a strong youkai, but since she pretty much never acts alone, this too is unclear.

Ran usually appears as a means for Yukari to attack, so when she flies, she often spins around. Perhaps the way Chen also spins around is related to this.

===Occupation===
As Yukari's [[shikigami]], Ran must do whatever Yukari commands her to do, such as doing Yukari's chores or checking the [[Great Hakurei Barrier]] around [[Gensokyo]] for problems. Apparently, Ran's own shikigami, Chen, is too unreliable to be entrusted with doing chores.

In her spare time, Ran often calculates various things such as [[Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red/Ran |the width of the Sanzu River]]. She may also be seen in the [[Human Village]] shopping for tofu. 

===Species===
;Shikigami
Ran's true identity is that of a [[shikigami]] possessing a [[youkai fox]], or youko ({{lang|ja|妖狐}}, "mystic fox"). The fox she is possessing is an entirely separate being, but since it never comes to surface, there's no problem in thinking of Ran as a nine-tailed fox herself.&lt;ref&gt;[[Strange Creators of Outer World/Who's Who of Humans &amp; Youkai in Gensokyo/Yukari Yakumo, Ran Yakumo, and Chen|Strange Creators of Outer World - Who's Who of Humans &amp; Youkai in Gensokyo: Yukari Yakumo, Ran Yakumo, and Chen]]&lt;/ref&gt; Because she is a [[shikigami]] herself, it's highly unusual that Ran has a shikigami of her own.
;Youkai fox
Ran's body is that of a youkai fox with nine large tails, which is a clear sign of great power and intelligence, as described by Akyuu&lt;ref&gt;[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Ran Yakumo]]&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Character Design==
[[File:PMiSS_ran.jpg|thumb|120px|Ran in ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]''.]]
===Name===
{{nihongo|''Ran Yakumo''|八雲　藍}} is her name. The characters for {{nihongo||八雲|Yakumo}} literally mean "eight clouds", and {{nihongo||藍|Ran}} literally means "indigo". All of the Yakumo family are named after colors.

Ran Yakumo is apparently not her real name; according to ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'', her name was given to by [[Yukari Yakumo]]. Her real name is unknown.

===Design===
In ''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]'', Ran has yellow eyes, short blonde hair, and nine fox tails. She wears a white dress with purple cuffs and collar, an indigo tabard with a white print, white and blue footwear, and a light pink two-tailed hat with many [[ofuda|amulets]] that hide her fox ears. According to ZUN, she is fairly tall.&lt;ref&gt;[[ZUN's E-mails]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearances==
;Perfect Cherry Blossom
[[File:Th07RanSprite.png|frame|Ran sprite in ''PCB'']]
{{Main|Perfect Cherry Blossom/Story/Reimu's Extra|Perfect Cherry Blossom/Story/Marisa's Extra|Perfect Cherry Blossom/Story/Sakuya's Extra|l1=Reimu Arc|l2=Marisa Arc|l3=Sakuya Arc}}
During ''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]'', Ran is busy preparing for a banquet for her master [[Yukari Yakumo]], who was still asleep as usual, when Ran was suddenly interrupted by the heroine.

;Imperishable Night
[[File:Th08Ran.png|frame|Ran in ''IN'']]
Ran makes a return in ''[[Imperishable Night]]'', somewhat as a playable character. Instead, she appears as a familiar of Yukari, where if the player chooses to focus, then Ran will appear in front of Yukari at a distance. She'll search for enemies and spin around on them until they're defeated. She'll act the same way if Yukari is unfocused while playing solo.

===Spin-offs===
;''Fighters''
{{multiple image

| align = right

}}
Ran appeared in ''[[Immaterial and Missing Power]]'', ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]'', and ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]'' as a projectile in Yukari's [[spell card]] ''Shikigami "Ran Yakumo"''. In [[Antinomy of Common Flowers]] she gets used in the same way, this time in a combined move with her servant [[Chen]].

;''Shoot the Bullet''
In ''[[Shoot the Bullet]]'', [[Aya Shameimaru]] encountered Ran on [[stage]] 8 and took photos of her [[danmaku]].

;''Hopeless Masquerade''
Ran made a background cameo appearance in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'' on the [[Hakurei Shrine]] stage. She is seen standing with [[Chen]] watching the fights.

===Literature===
;''Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red''
{{Main|Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red/Ran}}
Ran gets interviewed by [[Aya Shameimaru]] after she managed to determine the actual width of the [[Sanzu River]]. Ran also explains how equations and shikigami are related, and how Yukari's equations, which she uses to increase Ran's power indefinitely, are too much even for her to understand. 
{{Main|Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red/Yukari}}
In Yukari's article, Aya confronts Yukari after the latter smacked Ran with an umbrella as a punishment for having fought humans without Yukari's permission. Although Aya is outraged by an animal being abused like that, Yukari insists that Ran is not an animal, but a shikigami that sometimes forgets that she is a servant.

;''Silent Sinner in Blue''
Yukari requests Ran to search for allies to take revenge for her defeat in the 1st Lunar War. After asking various people, like [[Remilia Scarlet]], [[Yuyuko Saigyouji]], [[Youmu Konpaku]] or [[Suika Ibuki]], Ran explains that apparently the only interested person is Remilia, but that she doubts she will cooperate. Yukari tells her not to worry, as she has everything she needs, confusing Ran. After asking about her true intentions, Yukari will claim that only when she could do more than just mathematical calculus and could "add single digits" she could understand her plan &lt;ref name="CiLR&gt; Chapter 5 ''[[Cage in Lunatic Runagate]]'' &lt;/ref&gt;

The Full Moon day arrives and Ran follows Yukari in her journey to the [[Lunar Capital]]. However, they fall in [[Eirin Yagokoro]]'s trap, they are apprehended and they are taken to the Capital to be judged thanks to [[Watatsuki no Toyohime]]. After being released and surprised her master was so happy after seeing her plan failed, Ran asks for an explanation. Yukari then tells her the true nature of her plan and they celebrate their success at the [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]].

;''Alternative Facts in Eastern Utopia''
Ran was one of the visitors of the geyser hot springs right above [[Former Hell]]. When Aya asked her why she was keeping her hat in the bath, Ran said that it was because Aya was taking a picture of her.

;''Cheating Detective Satori''
Tired of the slowness and the supposed incompetency of [[Satori Komeiji]], [[Yukari]] orders both Ran and [[Chen]] to search for the vengeful spirit that was possessing a lot of youkais and humans in Gensokyo between all the [[Netherworld]] [[phantom]]s. They do so, and in chapter 8 Chen contacts Satori, [[Rin]] and [[Reimu]] to inform them that they had captured it. However, in chapter 10 [[Marisa Kirisame]] tells to both of them not only that they didn't captured it, but that it possessed their master Yukari. Surprised and worried about  her, they leave Marisa and Satori to find her.
==Relationships==
;[[Yukari Yakumo]] (Master)
Yukari is Ran's Master. As a shikigami, Ran must do whatever Yukari commands, but since Yukari is asleep most of the time, Ran has a lot of free time. When Ran follows Yukari's will, she can obtain power equal to Yukari's level, becoming much stronger than she usually is. However, Ran sometimes forgets that she is a shikigami, and Yukari scolds her as a result. 
;[[Chen]] (Shikigami)
Ran's shikigami. Since their relationship is the same as Ran's relationship with Yukari, one would expect Chen to follow anything that Ran commands, but Chen is unreliable and it's difficult for Ran to depend on her.

==Additional Information==
*The name of one of her [[Spell Card]]s, "[[Perfect Cherry Blossom: Extra Spell Cards#Spell Card 123|Princess Tenko]]," is likely a reference to a famous Japanese illusionist of the [[wikipedia:Princess_Tenko|same name]], considering how foxes are known for their tricks and illusions in folklore.
*Ran is the only [[stage]] mid-boss in any ''[[Touhou Project]]'' game that is immune to bombs.
*Since her master is the only Phantasm [[boss]], Ran is also the only Phantasm stage mid-boss.
*Both Ran and Yukari's surname was "Suzukaze" in the trial version ver. 0.09a of [[PCB]].&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/agagasoso/status/631132995148066817&lt;/ref&gt;

| translation =
'''Shikigami of the Gap Youkai'''&lt;br/&gt;

'''Ran Yakumo'''

Extra Boss, and [[Yukari Yakumo | Yukari]]'s [[shikigami]]. She does Yukari's work for her while her master sleeps. She has the ability to mainly use shikigami.

Yukari sleeps 12 hours per day and is only awake from sunset to midnight. On top of that, she hibernates through winter. Because of that, Ran takes care of Yukari's work while she's asleep.

Ran has been a shikigami for quite long time, so she's more powerful than ordinary [[youkai]]. For that matter, she has enough power to possess her own shikigami. Perhaps she has already forgotten that she herself is a shikigami.

Every year, when cherry blossoms are about to bloom, she visits the [[Netherworld]] for flower viewing. The cherry blossoms this year feels very pleasant. Just as she was considering that, some living [[human]]s dropped in. She watched them with interest for a few moments.

She later heard that [[Chen | her shikigami]] had been defeated by them, so she plotted a little revenge.

Her true form is a fox-turned youkai. Like [[Chen]], her shape is unchanged and she has a well-sociable personality. Even without looking closely, it's obvious that she has several tails. As a matter of fact, when it matters, she has plenty of power ever since she uses her true form.

Through all these events, her master continues to sleep.

{{nihongo|'''Reimu Hakurei'''|博麗　霊夢|Hakurei Reimu}} is the main protagonist of the ''[[Touhou Project]]'' series along with the deuteragonist, [[Marisa Kirisame]]. As the [[shrine maiden]] of the [[Hakurei Shrine]], she manages the [[Hakurei Border]] of [[Gensokyo]] and exterminates troublesome [[youkai]].

==General Information==
===Personality===
Reimu Hakurei's personality is typified by her desires, such as the desire to be wanted, to have good food, and to find happiness. Her biggest internal conflict comes from balancing her duties as the Hakurei shrine maiden and her own desires, though she does not seem to prefer acknowledging many of her internal conflicts.

Her duty as the shrine maiden gives Reimu a sense of purpose and identity, however, it conflicts with her desires in that it distances her from others and has her dealing with incidents and other related problems on a frequent basis. Despite her duty making it seem as though she antagonizes youkai, in truth, she wishes for peace between humans and youkai. 

Reimu is generally a joyful and airheaded person. She’s also incredibly prideful and quite arrogant due to it. She’s often seen in a good mood until her routines are broken by some outside influence, be it a youkai or the like. She is quick to anger, but she’s also quick to forget.

===Abilities===
;Ability to float
While many inhabitants of [[Gensokyo]] are capable of flying, Reimu's ability extends beyond that; she is someone who excels at floating through ''life'', displaying a level of oneness with her surroundings that has been compared to a [[hermit]]. While she "goes with the flow" Reimu displays superhuman instincts and incredible luck, naturally ending up on the path of least resistance through most situations; conversely, when distracted or acting with impure motives she quickly loses her edge.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'': Chapter 18&lt;/ref&gt; On one occasion observers saw Reimu dodging an attack "like she was made of air" while Reimu herself saw the attack swerving to avoid her;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Curiosities of Lotus Asia]]'': [[Curiosities of Lotus Asia/Chapter 03|Chapter 3]]&lt;/ref&gt; on another Reimu unknowingly walked across a river without getting wet, by stepping on fish that swam beneath her feet.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Eastern and Little Nature Deity]]'': Chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt; This also makes Reimu's techniques extremely hard for [[Marisa Kirisame]] to learn from, since even Reimu herself has trouble explaining what she's doing. The ultimate expression of this ability is ''Fantasy Nature'', which allows Reimu to float away from reality and become impossible to attack; this was considered too powerful for use as a [[spell card]] until Marisa gave it a name and time limit.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Grimoire of Marisa]]'': [[The Grimoire of Marisa/Reimu Hakurei's Spell Cards|Reimu Hakurei's Spell Cards]]&lt;/ref&gt;

;Aura manipulation
It's stated in the {{nihongo|omake.txt|おまけ.txt}} of ''[[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]]'' that Reimu can control the natural spirits of living things, an ability which isn't listed in any source afterwards. No clear instance of this ability has ever been displayed.

;Powers as the [[Hakurei]] [[Shrine Maiden]]
[[File:SSIBCH10ReimuSummoning.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Reimu invoking the gods in ''[[Silent Sinner in Blue]]''.]]
As the [[Hakurei Shrine|Hakurei]] shrine maiden, Reimu can handle the Hakurei [[Yin-Yang Orb]]s, and is trained in [[youkai]] extermination techniques as well as standard duties like performing blessings. Reimu is also capable of channeling [[Gensokyo]]'s [[god]]s, but she isn't well-trained enough to do so reliably.

;Barrier techniques
Reimu displays great aptitude with magical barriers (beyond that normally associated with [[shrine maiden]]s), presumably related to her work in maintaining the [[Great Hakurei Barrier]]. Among her techniques are barriers that explode, push enemies (or herself), or allow her to teleport. Reimu is capable of dismantling barriers and seals too complex for [[Marisa Kirisame]]&lt;ref&gt;''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]'': [[Perfect Cherry Blossom/Story/Marisa's Scenario|Marisa's scenario]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]'': [[Perfect Cherry Blossom/Story/Reimu's Scenario|Reimu's scenario]]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Patchouli Knowledge]]&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oriental Sacred Place]]'': Chapter 15&lt;/ref&gt; to understand, with what Marisa calls her "cheat technique".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Forbidden Scrollery]]'': Chapter 7&lt;/ref&gt;

;Other abilities
During the events of [[Urban Legend in Limbo]], and at least until the end of [[Antinomy of Common Flowers]], Reimu aquired abilities based on the "Gap Woman" urban legend. This allowed her to open gaps similar to the ones used by [[Yukari Yakumo]], which she used as portals for herself&lt;ref&gt;''[[Forbidden Scrollery]]'':Chapter 51&lt;/ref&gt; or to attack.&lt;ref&gt;[[Urban Legend in Limbo]]/[[Antinomy of Common Flowers]] - "Gap in the Great Hakurei Barrier" Skill&lt;/ref&gt;

===Occupation===
Reimu is the shrine maiden of the [[Hakurei Shrine]], and one of the main "incident resolvers" in Gensokyo. She and others characterize the time she spends at the shrine as largely boring and uneventful. While she is sometimes serious about her duties, she can't seem to get many worshippers at her shrine. It appears that youkai extermination is her only method of earning even a thin salary. 

[[Yukari Yakumo]] describes Reimu's job as not being that of a youkai exterminator, but rather a "balancer between humans and youkai", who prevents youkai from attacking humans and humans from becoming youkai.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Forbidden Scrollery]]:Chapter 53''&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'' depicts Reimu as frequently coming up with various schemes to make money, which generally fail due to her own lack of foresight.

===Possessions===
In most of the Touhou games, Reimu uses the [[Yin-Yang Orb]]s in combat. In ''[[Subterranean Animism]]'' they also functioned as communicators with people above the surface. In addition, she usually carries a gohei, sometimes referred to as her [[purification rod]], originally prepared by [[Rinnosuke Morichika]].

She also possesses a great amount of [[ofuda]], sacred paper charms with anti-[[youkai]] properties that she uses to fight, seal or exterminate youkai of any kind in her [[danmaku]]. Apparently, she can also use them to create barriers and even clones of herself.&lt;ref&gt; ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]] - Skill Card: [[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody/Spell Cards/Reimu Hakurei#Skill Card 11|Instant Dimensional Rift]]&lt;/ref&gt; Like the Yin-Yang Orbs, she uses them in most, if not all, games she has appeared in, either as a normal shot (usually with homing properties) or as bullets for her [[spell card]]s. Aside from this, the other projectile she uses is a large collection of throwing needles hidden within her sleeves.

===Machinery===
In PC-98 canon, she possesses a robot called [[Ruukoto]], given to her by [[Yumemi Okazaki]] as a reward for defeating her. Ruukoto has not been seen outside of ''[[Phantasmagoria of Dim.Dream]]''.

==Backstory==
Not much is known about Reimu's history prior to the events of the games. Her earliest mention in the Gensokyo timeline is four to five years prior to Chapter 22 of ''[[Curiosities of Lotus Asia]]'', which took place in 2006. [[ZUN]] does mention in one of his [[Shanghai Alice Correspondence]] documents that there was a previous Hakurei Shrine Maiden, and it's generally assumed that there's a line of them.

In Chapter 25 of [[Wild and Horned Hermit]], with night's darkness fast approaching, an annoyed Reimu remarks, "Believe not they will be around for you always: parents and daylight". The quote was thought to imply that Reimu knew her parents, but they're gone and she's rather bitter about it. However, her line was modified from a haiku about the transient, changing nature of things, the original subjects being parents and money ({{lang|jp|いつまでも / あると思うな / 親と金}}). In chapter 2 of ''[[Curiosities of Lotus Asia]]'', Marisa remarks, "She was a foundling", though the context of this scene suggests that this could just be a throwaway line.

==Background Information==
[[File:PMiSS reimu.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Reimu, as illustrated in ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]''.]]

===Origin===
Reimu Hakurei as a [[Shrine Maiden]] is likely inspired by other shrine maidens in video games such as Sayo-chan from ''[[Wikipedia:KiKi KaiKai|KiKi KaiKai]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Interview_on_Creative_Train|Interview on Creative Train]] Q: How was Touhou Born?&lt;/ref&gt; In general, [[ZUN]] thought it was a good idea to include a [[shrine maiden]] in an STG compared to other typical futuristic STGs simply because it was unusual at the time of her creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Davison|first=Pete|title=Curtains for You: The History of Bullet Hell|url=https://www.usgamer.net/articles/curtains-for-you-the-history-of-bullet-hell|website=US Gamer|date=8 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Name===
Reimu's full name is {{nihongo||博麗 霊夢|Reimu Hakurei}}. The characters for Reimu's last name {{nihongo||博麗|Hakurei}} literally mean something along the lines of "esteemed companion". The first word {{nihongo||[[wiktionary:博|博]]|Haku}} means "wide" or "exposition" while {{nihongo||[[wiktionary:麗|麗]]|Rei}} means "lovely", "graceful", or "beautiful". Her first name {{nihongo||霊夢|Reimu|lit. "spirit/soul dream"}} is a relevant Japanese word that refers to a "divine revelation made through dreams".

In the [[PC-98]] game era, her name was written with a slight difference. {{lang|ja|博麗}}&lt;big&gt;'''{{lang|ja|[[wiktionary:靈|靈]]}}'''&lt;/big&gt;{{lang|ja|夢}} was changed to {{lang|ja|博麗}}&lt;big&gt;'''{{lang|ja|[[wiktionary:霊|霊]]}}'''&lt;/big&gt;{{lang|ja|夢}} from ''[[Shuusou Gyoku]]'' onwards. "{{lang|ja|靈}}" is an [[Wikipedia:Hyōgaiji|uncommon]] form of "{{lang|ja|霊}}" with identical meanings. In the Japanese community, "{{lang|ja|博麗靈夢}}" is used to refer to Reimu in the PC-98 era specifically. Incidentally, Chinese (Taiwanese) fans who use the [[wikipedia:Traditional Chinese characters|Traditional Chinese characters]] also adopt this style to refer to Reimu in general (old Japanese kanji form and traditional [[wikipedia:Chinese characters|hanzi]] are basically identical).

===Design===
Reimu is of moderate height. In PC-98 canon, she is depicted as having purple hair and eyes, and she wears a large red ribbon at the back of her head, and red tubes on her sidelocks. From [[Story of Eastern Wonderland]] to [[Mystic Square]] she wears an outfit like a traditional shrine maiden uniform, with a red hakama over a white kimono.

However, her best known design is that of the Windows era. She has brown-black hair which varies in length and style between games (tending towards long and loose in later works), and her eyes vary from brown to red to even blue depending on the game, but she still wears a red ribbon and matching tubes on her sidelocks. She's still seen in her "shrine maiden uniform", but it now bears little in common with the standard uniform beyond the red-and-white colour scheme (which ZUN has acknowledged&lt;ref&gt;[[ZUN's reply to messages on the former Gensou Bulletin Board 3]]&lt;/ref&gt;). This uniform consists of a red skirt (rather than the standard [[wikipedia:Hakama|hakama]]), a sleeveless red top with a white collar, tied with a ribbon whose color varies across games, and a pair of white detached sleeves which exposes her [[wikipedia:sarashi|sarashi]]. Due to the color scheme, she's occasionally called the "red-white shrine maiden"&lt;ref&gt;''[[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]]'' - Extra stage&lt;/ref&gt;. Her shaman clothing and her [[purification rod]] came from [[Rinnosuke Morichika]], but it's unknown who designs them. 

On the Trial+ version of Perfect Cherry Blossom's portraits, as well her larger portrait on the character selection screen, she appears with white gloves. These were removed in the final release of that game, but the gloves on the character selection screen were kept. She has no longer been depicted with these gloves ever since.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:PCB Trial Portraits.png|Portraits used in the Trial+ version of Perfect Cherry Blossom]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearances==
Unless specified, Reimu has always held the role of a playable character in the majority of the games.

===PC-98===
;''Highly Responsive to Prayers''
:{{Main|Highly Responsive to Prayers#Story|l1=Highly Responsive to Prayers Story}}
A lone shrine sits Far East: the [[Hakurei Shrine]]. The powerful seal placed there has worn away, and many strange creatures are starting to come out. Now Reimu, seeking revenge (or possibly just to sate her curiosity), and armed with the shrine's treasure, the [[Yin-Yang Orb]]s, goes to the gate to face the [[Youkai|non-human]] creatures inside. The gate will lead to either [[Makai]] or [[Hell]] depending on which route the player chooses.

;''Story of Eastern Wonderland''
:{{Main|Story of Eastern Wonderland/Story|l1=Story of Eastern Wonderland Story}}
Reimu is training intensely in the harsh extremities of a mountain (or taking it easy), but when she returns to the shrine, she finds it infested by [[youkai]], [[ghost]]s and other non-human creatures. With her faithful turtle [[Genjii]] and her trusty Yin-Yang Orbs, she sets out to find the one who caused the trouble. Her journey leads her to [[Rika]], the culprit, as well as [[Mima]], who has broken the seal placed on her in ''[[Highly Responsive to Prayers]]'', and desires the power of the Yin-Yang Orbs for herself. Reimu is victorious in battle and learns the truth behind the Yin-Yang Orbs.

;''Phantasmagoria of Dim.Dream''
:{{Main|Phantasmagoria of Dim.Dream/Translation/Reimu's Scenario|l1=Phantasmagoria of Dim.Dream Reimu's Scenario}}
Things have been peaceful lately so Reimu has time to kill. When some old ruins appear near the shrine, promising a reward for whoever can manage to make it inside, she decides to enter a sort of tournament to decide who'll go in. This is the first time Reimu appeared as a [[boss]]. Assuming she's the player character, she defeats all six opponents and makes it inside to confront [[Chiyuri Kitashirakawa]] and [[Yumemi Okazaki]], who have come from the real world in search of proof of magic. As a reward for defeating her, Yumemi gives Reimu the housekeeping robot [[Ruukoto]].

;''Lotus Land Story''
:{{Main|Lotus Land Story/Story|l1=Lotus Land Story Story}}
Reimu mulls over on how quiet things have been, but soon enough, youkai and spirits start flooding out into [[Gensokyo]] again, putting her shrine in danger. She confronts a few, then realizes this must have been the work of something bigger, and decides to go straight to the source of the issue. She makes her way through to the [[Fantasy World]], where she finally meets [[Yuuka Kazami]] and defeats her.

;''Mystic Square''
:{{Main|Mystic Square/Translation/Reimu's Scenario|l1=Mystic Square Reimu's Scenario}}
A large outpour of [[demon]]s are appearing throughout the land from [[Makai]], and Reimu sets out to exterminate them. She reaches the creator of Makai itself, [[Shinki]], and defeats her in battle. Afterwards, she learns that the youkai and demon overflow in [[Gensokyo]] is the fault of some kind of Makai travel agency. Shinki promises to do something about it, but the demons make their way back to the shrine anyway.

===Games===
;''Embodiment of the Scarlet Devil''
[[File:Th06ReimuBackSprite.png|frame|left|Reimu's back sprite in ''EoSD'']]
:{{Main|Embodiment of Scarlet Devil/Story/Reimu's Scenario|l1=Embodiment of the Scarlet Devil Reimu's Scenario}}
[[File:079BAiJRspecialEoSD.jpg|thumb|200px|Reimu in the Scarlet Mist Incident]]
A scarlet mist covers the sky of Gensokyo. Reimu, who's annoyed by the mist, sets out to stop the incident. Her travels lead her to the [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]], whose owner, [[Remilia Scarlet]], has spread the mist to try and block out the sun's rays, as she is a [[vampire]]. After defeating her, Remilia soon comes to visit her at the shrine, but Reimu has to return to the mansion when an odd rain suddenly appears over it, in order to deal with [[Flandre Scarlet]].

;''Perfect Cherry Blossom''
[[File:Th07ReimuBackSprite.png|frame|left|Reimu's back sprite in ''PCB'']]
:{{Main|Perfect Cherry Blossom/Story/Reimu's Scenario|l1=Perfect Cherry Blossom Reimu's Scenario}}
[[File:081BAiJRspecialPCB.jpg|thumb|200px|Reimu in the Spring Snow Incident]]
Even though it's May, spring shows no signs of coming, leaving the inhabitants of [[Gensokyo]] in a cold winter weather that only gets worse. Reimu, noticing cherry petals blowing from the [[Netherworld]], decides to set out and stop the perpetrator from holding spring hostage. After making her way into the Netherworld, she comes to [[Hakugyokurou]], where the ghost [[Yuyuko Saigyouji]] spends her time administrating the spirits of the dead. She was gathering the essence of spring to try and make the [[Saigyou Ayakashi]] bloom, but Reimu stops her before she completes it. Later on, Yuyuko asks Reimu to go deal with her friend [[Yukari Yakumo]], as she's the one who has been weakening the boundary between Gensokyo and the Netherworld.

;''Imperishable Night''
[[File:Th08ReimuBackSprite.png|frame|left|Reimu's back sprite in ''IN'']]
[[File:Th08ReimuSprite.png|frame|Reimu's sprite in ''IN'']]
:{{Main|Imperishable Night/Story/Boundary Team's Scenario 1|l1=Imperishable Night Boundary Team's Scenario}}
[[File:085BAiJRspecial IN.jpg|thumb|200px|Reimu in the Eternal Night Incident]]
Yukari isn't able to sleep and discovers the full moon is nowhere to be found; it has been replaced with a fake moon, and the night appears to have stopped. She convinces Reimu into investigating the cause with her. After dealing with a few youkai, and [[Marisa Kirisame]] in particular, who demands to know why they've created this eternal night, they reach [[Eientei]], a house hidden in the [[Bamboo Forest of the Lost]]. Once there, they either confront [[Eirin Yagokoro]] or [[Kaguya Houraisan]]. Eirin explains that she actually sealed the Earth away from the [[Moon]] in order to prevent the Lunarians from taking Kaguya back. Kaguya, however, has tired of hiding, and so challenges Reimu and Yukari to complete her five impossible requests. Once they're defeated, they undo the seal (and thus "return" the real moon to Gensokyo). Afterwards, they all decide to have a moon viewing. Later on, Kaguya sends them into another part of the Bamboo Forest of the Lost as a "test of guts" - but her true intentions are revealed to be trying to annoy [[Fujiwara no Mokou]], another immortal human, and her eternal rival.

In the Magic and Scarlet Team's scenarios, she attacks the teams in the [[Bamboo Forest of the Lost]], accusing them of being behind the eternal night and falsely accusing the Magic Team of being behind the fake moon.

;''Phantasmagoria of Flower View''
[[File:Th09ReimuBackSprite.png|frame|left|Reimu's back sprite in ''PoFV'']]
:{{Main|Phantasmagoria of Flower View/Story#Reimu's Story|l1=Phantasmagoria of Flower View Reimu's Scenario}}
Reimu, who's usually easy-going, is disturbed by the amount of flowers blooming and, not to be the one who shrugs off her duties, goes on to search for answers. She fights through many opponents, including news reporter [[Aya Shameimaru]], in search of the truth. Eventually she reaches [[Muenzuka]], where the [[shinigami]] [[Komachi Onozuka]], who appears to have been slacking off on her job to manage said spirits. [[Eiki Shiki, Yamaxanadu]] appears after Reimu beats Komachi up, and explains what's happening - an awful lot of spirits of the dead suddenly arrived from the [[Human World]], and they're having trouble accomodating all of them. After a lecture, they do battle, and Reimu emerges victorious. The three of them have a flower viewing later on, where it's explained that as the spirits of the dead cross the [[Sanzu River]], the flowers' blooming will settle down.

;''Mountain of Faith''
:{{Main|Mountain of Faith/Story/Reimu's Scenario|l1=Mountain of Faith Reimu's Scenario}}
Reimu's shrine has become a hotspot for [[youkai]], so she doesn't get many [[human]] visitors to do patronage. She receives a foreboding threat from a [[Sanae Kochiya|mysterious human visitor]], who demands that the [[Hakurei shrine]] be shut down and submit to another god. Reimu, always the optimist, decided to go to [[Youkai Mountain]] to face the goddess who's making these threats. She fights her way up to the [[Moriya Shrine]] and defeats its shrine maiden, [[Sanae Kochiya]], as well as its resident god, [[Kanako Yasaka]], thus saving her own shrine. Afterwards, Reimu summons everyone to the shrine to watch the autumn leaves, where she vouches for Sanae and Kanako and tells [[Nitori]] and [[Aya]] that they should invite them over for drinks sometime and generally get along. Sanae also tells Reimu that youkai are a good source of faith. A while later, Marisa brings Reimu the rumor that a second god is actually living at the Moriya Shrine, and she goes to check it out. She then meets [[Suwako Moriya]] and defeats her.

;''Subterranean Animism''

A geyser appears behind [[Hakurei Shrine]], and at first Reimu is happy, since its heat will alleviate the cold of winter. However, [[Evil spirit|evil spirit]]s begin emerging from the earth and loitering about [[Gensokyo]]. Reimu is sent to investigate with either [[Yukari Yakumo]], [[Suika Ibuki]], or [[Aya Shameimaru]], depending on what shot type the player chooses. She communicates them throughout her trip via her Yin-Yang Orbs. She heads straight to the [[Underworld]], and fights her way deeper and deeper until reaching the [[Palace of the Earth Spirits]]. There she meets [[Satori Komeiji]], whose two pets apparently have something to do with it. Reimu defeats [[Rin Kaenbyou]], then reaches [[Utsuho Reiuji]], who, with her newfound powers, is maintaining the hellfire that heats the Underground, and is responsible for the geysers that let the evil spirits leak out. She defeats her as well, then returns to the surface. Rin starts frequenting the shrine, though mostly for food, and eventually they make the geyser behind the shrine into a hot spring. Utsuho later explains how she came to possess such power, and it seems to point straight towards Kanako and Suwako, so Reimu sets off for the Youkai Mountain again. When she gets to the shrine, however, she meets [[Koishi Komeiji]], who was apparently also looking for who gave Utsuho those powers. Suwako comes out to meet them after they fight and explains it's all part of their "industrial revolution project".

;''Undefined Fantastic Object''
:{{Main|Undefined Fantastic Object/Story/Reimu A's Scenario|l1=Reimu A Scenario|Undefined Fantastic Object/Story/Reimu B's Scenario|l2=Reimu B Scenario}}
When the treasure ship appears in the skies of Gensokyo, Reimu decides to go after it. She forces her way into it only to discover that there's no treasure inside. However, [[Minamitsu Murasa]] tells her they're headed to [[Makai]] to revive a "saint" of some sort. She follows them there and meets [[Byakuren Hijiri]], a Buddhist monk that loves youkai and humans equally. That certainly won't do, so Reimu beats her up. She and Byakuren later fly around the skies on the ship, but afterwards the ship is landed and renovated into the [[Myouren Temple]]. A little later, she follows up on the strange light that was following her during the journey, and it turns out to be [[Nue Houjuu]], a straggler from Byakuren's group. Reimu defeats her and persuades her to visit the temple.

;''Ten Desires''
:{{Main|Ten Desires/Story/Reimu's Scenario|l1=Ten Desires Story}}
A large number of [[Divine spirit|divine spirit]]s appear, threatening the flower viewing, so it's up to Reimu to figure out what's causing it. She visits the [[Netherworld]] first; while [[Yuyuko Saigyouji]] isn't the culprit, she points the shrine maiden towards the [[Myouren Temple]]. After forcing her way to the graveyard, she discovers the spirits all flocking to the [[Hall of Dreams' Great Mausoleum]]. Once inside, she defeats the newly resurrected [[Mononobe no Futo]] and [[Toyosatomimi no Miko]] in battle. When she finds that the temple is bringing in a youkai from the outside world for war against Miko, she finds and defeats [[Mamizou Futatsuiwa]].

;''Double Dealing Character''

:{{Main|Double Dealing Character/Story/Reimu A's Scenario|l1=Reimu A Scenario|Double Dealing Character/Story/Reimu B's Scenario|l2=Reimu B Scenario}}
After discovering that previously docile youkai have become violent, Reimu learns from [[Yatsuhashi Tsukumo]] and [[Benben Tsukumo]] that a group of youkai are planning social upheaval. She travels to the [[Shining Needle Castle]] and defeats [[Seija Kijin]], who remarks that her allies can become as strong as they want to if they ignore the consequences. After being led by Seija to the inner parts of the castle, she defeats the Miracle Mallet-wielding [[Shinmyoumaru Sukuna]]. Afterwards, a magical storm similar to the one caused by the Miracle Mallet rages and Reimu finds that the cause is the tsukumogami [[Raiko Horikawa]], who had successfully changed her source of magic to that of the outside world. After beating Raiko, Reimu lets her go in exchange for not causing any problems in the future.

;''Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom''
:{{Main|Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom/Story/Reimu's Scenario|l1= Reimu's Scenario}}
Mysterious machines similar to proves begin to appear all over Gensokyo withering everything in its path. Reimu drinks the [[Ultramarine Orb Elixir]] (or not, depending of the player’s actions) to travel to the Moon, following [[Eirin]]’s orders and goes to the Moon to prevent the invasion. There, Reimu learns that the Moon people wanted to migrate to Gensokyo because there was a person who was attacking the Lunar Capital. After traveling to the Sea of Tranquility, Reimu encounters [[Junko]], the true culprit of the incident. Reimu beats her and comes back to Gensokyo, but the Moon rabbits are still in Gensokyo, so she goes again to the [[Dream World]], where she encounters Junko again and fights the Hell goddess, [Hecatia Lapislazuli]], who trapped the lunarians in the Dream World.

;''Hidden Star in Four Seasons''
:{{Main|Hidden Star in Four Seasons/Story/Reimu's Scenario|l1= Reimu's Scenario}}
An anormal climate in Gensokyo alarms Reimu, who leaves the shrine to investigate. In her way, she encounters fairies who were strengthen and were from one place to another releasing their new powers, affecting the seasons.
Using a backdoor in [[Narumi Yatadera]]’s back, she enters the [[Land of the Backdoor]], where she finds and fights  [[Satono Nishida]]  and [[Mai Teireida]]. After that, she encounters [[Okina Matara]], who claims to be the responsable of the strengthening of the fairies. Reimu chooses to fight her, but she’s trapped and kicked of the Land of the Backdoor. After recolecting some doyou, she fights again Okina in a rematch she leaves victorious.

An eagle spirit contacts Reimu just when other beast spirits begin to appear in Gensokyo, trying to take Gensokyo by force. It claims to be a traitor, and asks Reimu for help to defeat the invasion, as it was needed a human to do it. 
After entering Hell and defeat some youkais, Reimu is guided by [[Yachie Kicchou]] to the Animal Realm, where she finds [[Keiki Haniyasushin]]. Reimu starts to doubt about the spirit’s words after listening to Keiki intentions, but she fights the god anyways. 
The spirits take advantage of the god’s defeat to attack the Human Realm, this time seriously. 
Reimu comes back to Hell, where she finds [[Saki Kurokoma]], leader of the Keiga family and boss of the eagle spirit.
;''Unconnected Marketeers''
{{Main|Unconnected Marketeers/Story/Reimu's Scenario|l1= Reimu's Scenario}}
Mysterious cards with human and youkais’ abilities start to appear all over Gensokyo.
Reimu fears that those cards fall into the wrong hands, so she decided to investigate.
After defeating some youkais, she reaches the peak of the [[Youkai Mountain]], where she finds [[Megumu Iizunamaru]], who claims to be the creator of the hands. However, she explains that she can’t control the circulation of said cards, and that if Reimu wants to do it, she needs to see the goddess [[Chimata Tenkyuu]].
The goddess atacks Reimu after finding out that Reimu wanted not to trade, but to steal all the cards. After the battle, Reimu finds an unknown person in the Rainbow Dragon Cave. She goes there to prevent a battle between [[Tsukasa Kudamaki]] and that person, but also because her investigation didn’t end. There she finds  [[Momoyo Himemushi]], who misunderstood Reimu and attacks her thinking she was a thief.

[[File:083BAiJRspecial IaMP.jpg|thumb|200px||Reimu in the Night Parade of One Hundred Oni Every Four Days Incident]]
As Reimu makes preparations for an upcoming feast, both [[human]]s and [[youkai]] are drawn to the feast and are unable to stop partying. Reimu is suspicious of a strange mist that covers Gensokyo and goes to investigate. She roams around, beating up various characters she suspects to be the culprit. She cannot find them; but on the day of the feast, [[Suika Ibuki]] finally makes herself known, and [[Yukari Yakumo]] shows Reimu to her.

:{{Main|Scarlet Weather Rhapsody/Story#Reimu's Story|l1=Scarlet Weather Rhapsody Reimu's Scenario}}
The [[Hakurei Shrine]] is suddenly destroyed by an earthquake, but upon consulting with Marisa, Reimu finds out that no one else felt it, so there must be something odd going on. She goes around to various suspicious characters, including [[Komachi Onodzuka]], who Reimu initially suspects. However, it's not her, so Reimu ends up making her way towards [[Heaven]], where the celestials [[Iku Nagae]] and [[Tenshi Hinanawi]] reside. Tenshi reveals she started the incident simply because she was bored watching everyone else getting involved in incidents and wanted to start her own. She also claims she destroyed Reimu's shrine so Reimu would be motivated to resolve the incident; Reimu promptly resolves the incident by defeating Tenshi. Afterwards, Tenshi has a legion of celestials help rebuild her shrine.

:{{Main|Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red/Reimu|l1=Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red Article and Interview: Reimu}}
Shortly after the events of ''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]'', [[Aya Shameimaru]] attends a flower viewing at the [[Hakurei Shrine]], where she meets Reimu, who's in a foul mood since no one wants to help her clean up after event. Aya plies her with sake and questions her about the incident, commenting in the article that "Reimu just seems to be a laid-back drunkard".
In the follow-up interview, Reimu claims Aya's paper is full of lies and insists her account of the incident is true, though Aya still doesn't recognize Reimu's deeds.

;''Silent Sinner in Blue''
Sometime not long after the events of ''[[Mountain of Faith]]'', Reimu is recruited by the members of the Scarlet Devil Mansion to power their rocket to the moon. The group is defeated by the Watatsuki sisters, who keep Reimu on the moon for a short period of time to clear their names before returning her unharmed to Gensokyo. Unbeknownst to almost everyone involved, their voyage was simply one part of a complex ploy by Yukari to intimidate the residents of Eientei.

[[File:ThGK Bunbunmaru12.jpg|thumb|200px|Reimu in ''SoPm'', with her shrine destroyed]]
:{{Main|Symposium of Post-mysticism/Bunbunmaru Newspaper 12|l1=Symposium of Post-mysticism Article: Reimu}}
In ''[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]]'', Reimu appeared on part 6 of the symposium. It was stated that Reimu was hiding and hearing over the whole symposium, that was attended by [[Hieda no Akyuu]], [[Marisa Kirisame]], [[Kanako Yasaka]], [[Byakuren Hijiri]] and [[Toyosatomimi no Miko]]. When she was revealed by Akyuu, Marisa noticed that she had an angry look on her face (although she seems to not be angry with Akyuu). That's because she's not happy with the discussion the group was having, believing that it's all nonsense. She slammed a pile of newspapers in front of them to prove how bad the [[youkai]] are and tells them to stop the symposium immediately. She was requested by the [[human]]s of the [[Human Village]] to stop this as they were aware – and felt uncomfortable – of "non-humans" discussing on changing the way of Gensokyo's life. The group were unhappy with her personality and her way of "fight-first, ask-later" attitude towards youkai, and can't even spend another minute finishing their sake.

There was also an article included, written by [[Aya Shameimaru]], that involved Reimu's broken-down [[Hakurei Shrine]] during the events of ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]''. It stated that it collapsed due to a localised earthquake and that the roof caved into the shrine. Aya found it suspicious that a [[celestial]], that been [[Tenshi Hinanawi]], came to help and re-build it.

;''Wild and Horned Hermit''
Reimu finds her shrine frequented by a mysterious hermit going by the name of [[Kasen Ibaraki]]. ''Wild and Horned Hermit'' follows the various escapades and adventures of Reimu and her friends in concurrence to the timeline of the games. Reimu in ''WaHH'' is generally short-sighted and obsessed with making a profit.

;''Forbidden Scrollery''
When book-lender [[Kosuzu Motoori]] of the [[Human Village]] begins dabbling with demon books, Reimu finds herself frequently having to sort out the incidents caused by the youkai that are released from them. In contrast to ''Wild and Horned Hermit'', which is fairly lighthearted, ''Forbidden Scrollery'' depicts Reimu as a shrine maiden who struggles to maintain the image of a protector for the Human Village while maintaining the masquerade set in place by the youkai.

===Seihou Project===
[[File:Sh01Reimu.png|thumb|Reimu as she appears in ''[[Shuusou Gyoku]]''.]]
{{seihou note|section}}
;''Shuusou Gyoku''
{{Main|Shuusou Gyoku/Story/Extra Scenario|l1=Shuusou Gyoku: Extra Scenario}}
[[File:Sh01ReimuSprite.png|frame|left|Reimu sprite in ''SSG'']]
Reimu has made a guest appearance as the second Extra stage [[boss]] of ''[[Seihou Project]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s first work ''[[Shuusou Gyoku]]'', a [[danmaku]] game series by the junior doujin circle "[[Shunsatsu sare do?]]", where [[ZUN]] also contributed music and art to the game. It seems like ZUN put her in the game along with [[Marisa Kirisame]]. Her title was "Eternal Shrine Maiden" and her theme was "Dichromatic Lotus Butterfly ~ Ancients". To add to this, [[Yuuka Kazami]] made a guest appearances in the following work, ''[[Kioh Gyoku]]''.

She seems to have no view towards the [[Seihou World]]; she doesn't know that there's no vegetation and has no thoughts about scientific machinery. After VIVIT defeated Marisa at the [[Hakurei Shrine]] in [[Gensokyo]], Marisa was then thudded by Reimu for fighting at the [[Hakurei Shrine]]. Reimu attacked her with two [[purification rod]]s before she could explain what she was doing. After Reimu lost, VIVIT told her that she was looking for the [[Holy Grail]], causing Reimu to become confused and start asking questions.

==Relationships==
Although Reimu often shows up as the main character, she doesn't participate in mundane activities to the extent [[Marisa Kirisame]] does, limiting her familiarity with most of [[Gensokyo]]'s population. Nevertheless, she has interacted with almost every other character that has ever made a physical appearance, with a few exceptions such as the [[Giant Catfish]], [[Renko Usami]], and [[Maribel Hearn]].

===[[Marisa Kirisame]]===
[[File:SSiBArtWallpaper1.jpg|thumb|192px|Reimu and Marisa, in ''[[Silent Sinner in Blue]]''.]]
Reimu’s closest friend is Marisa Kirisame, and the two of them spend most of their time together. They are seen together most often in the print works, game and extra stage prologues where they hang out at the shrine together, chatting about the latest rumors and news in Gensokyo. They’ve known each other since childhood and have been close ever since. 

Reimu and Marisa often quarrel and spar with each other, for reasons ranging from resolving incidents to hotpot ingredients. Regardless, they usually resolve their differences and continue being as close as ever.

They’ve also worked together on numerous occasions, such as when they chased down an enenra, or worked to exterminate a vengeful spirit. Though generally, they solve incidents at their own pace.

===[[Yukari Yakumo]]===
Despite her antagonistic personality, Yukari Yakumo mentors Reimu by pushing her to increase her spiritual powers, such as learning how to invoke the gods in ''[[Silent Sinner in Blue]]''. In that case, Reimu followed her instructions and orders to train hard despite Yukari not informing Reimu why she needed to do so, displaying how much Reimu either trusts Yukari or has decided it's pointless to argue with her (or both). Yukari occasionally seeks Reimu's assistance in resolving incidents in ''[[Imperishable Night]]'' and ''[[Subterranean Animism]]''. In this regard, she is an employer of sorts, as she remarks about compensating Reimu accordingly during the [[Imperishable Night]] incident. Yukari is also secretly a benefactor as well, donating to the shrine behind Reimu's back. Reimu is unaware of that, however.

===[[Rinnosuke Morichika]]===
Reimu is familiar with Rinnosuke Morichika, a shopkeeper who owns [[Kourindou]], who she sometimes visits to hang out or for wares (and sometimes shoplifts). She apparently has a large unpaid tab for requested items and services, but denies it since Rinnosuke "never accepts money" (which he denies being the case). Rinnosuke was also the one that originally prepared her [[purification rod]] for her use.

===[[Sanae Kochiya]]===
Despite being the priestess of a rival shrine, Sanae Kochiya is on friendly terms with Reimu and appears frequently in ''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'' alongside Reimu and Marisa. She came on a bit strongly when she and Reimu first met, but she really thought she was helping the Hakurei Shrine out by attempting to get it to switch gods to [[Kanako Yasaka]]. After ''[[Mountain of Faith]]'', Sanae offered to help Reimu as a fellow shrine maiden to gather faith for the shrine, and she appears to have been friends with Reimu since then. Nonetheless, the two have no qualms about antagonizing the other at times, though these quarrels are usually resolved by the next time they meet.

===[[Kasen Ibaraki]]===
Kasen Ibaraki is a regular at the shrine and acts as a mentor (and sometimes guardian) of Reimu, whom she fears is too concerned with worldly desires. Kasen actually initially became Reimu's mentor as part of her own plan, but she continues to view herself as a mentor after her goals were achieved. Reimu mostly thinks of Kasen as a nagging, preachy busybody. However, Reimu often concedes, either because Kasen is usually right or she doesn't want to deal with her. Kasen is openly critical of Reimu, believing her to be too greedy and slack in her duties.  In spite of this, Reimu views Kasen as a genuine friend. When fighting Kasen's arm, Reimu was unable to bring herself to fight Kasen whole-heartedly until she realized that the arm battling her was actually a separate entity from Kasen. By the present day, Reimu knows that Kasen is secretly an oni, but partially due to this friendship and partially due to owing Kasen for all the money that one of Kasen's schemes got her, Reimu can't tell anyone else about it.

===[[Genjii]]===
In the [[PC-98]] [[canon]], Reimu used a [[turtle]] as a means for flight until the end of ''[[Mystic Square]]''; that turtle was Genjii. Reimu calls him "gramps".

===[[Three Fairies of Light]]===
Reimu is often the target of pranks by the Three Fairies of Light, and Reimu tends to exterminate them on sight whenever she catches them (unless Marisa's escorting them). As of ''[[Oriental Sacred Place]]'', the three fairies moved into a tree near the [[Hakurei Shrine]] and become Reimu's neighbors, increasing the amount of pranks even more. Reimu aims to evict the fairies, but cannot find their treehouse, which is actually located on the [[Hakurei Border]]. Eventually, in an attempt to befriend Reimu so she'll no longer threaten them, the three fairies challenge her to a battle, reasoning that Reimu tends to befriend many youkai after fighting them. After an intense battle, Reimu finally defeats the fairies (instantly), and points out that their line of reasoning is utterly ridiculous. Despite this, Marisa finds that Reimu befriended the fairies after all, and as of the end of Oriental Sacred Place, the fairies now happily openly spend time at the shrine while helping Reimu out with various chores.

===[[Byakuren Hijiri]]===
Reimu views Byakuren Hijiri and the [[Myouren Temple]] as a rival of sorts to herself and the Hakurei Shrine. In ''[[Ten Desires]]'', [[Toyosatomimi no Miko]] points out that Reimu is friendly towards Byakuren. Although Reimu says they're religious rivals, she doesn't seem to deny it. In one of her ''[[Undefined Fantastic Object]]'' endings, Reimu is depressed at how quickly Byakuren's temple is picking up followers compared to her own shrine. By the time of ''[[Strange and Bright Nature Deity]]'', Reimu is angry at the temple for stealing away her shrine's followers (ignoring that her shrine never had (m)any followers in the first place), but Byakuren seems unaware of this.

===[[Kosuzu Motoori]]===
Kosuzu Motoori, the daughter of the book-lender in the Human Village, has a great deal of respect for Reimu. She is convinced that no harm will come to her from dealing with the youma books, because she is sure that Reimu will come save her if anything happens.

===Minor Relationships===
;[[The Hakurei God]]
Reimu knows next to nothing about the god dwelling in her shrine, making her unable to provide it with faith despite her efforts. Byakuren stated in one of the endings for ''[[Undefined Fantastic Object]]'' that the god is mad due to this.

;[[Ruukoto]]
In the PC-98 canon, she obtains a [[robot]]ic maid named [[Ruukoto]] as a servant at the end of ''[[Phantasmagoria of Dim.Dream]]'' though no reference has been made to it since.

;[[Mima]]
In the PC-98 canon, Mima is an [[Onryou#Akuryou|Akuryou]] who haunts the surroundings of the [[Hakurei Shrine]], after many confrontations and being resealed by Reimu, she decides to spend her days making fun of the shrine maiden.

;[[Suika Ibuki]]
Suika Ibuki, who often freeloads her shrine after the events of ''[[Immaterial and Missing Power]]'' is also is her ally during ''[[Subterranean Animism]]''. Reimu saw Suika's presence as a nuisance at first, but never really bothered with driving her away.

;[[Aya Shameimaru]]
Aya Shameimaru]], the tengu reporter was also her ally during the events of ''Subterranean Animism''.

;[[Misumaru Tamatsukuri]]
Although Reimu never met her before the Ability Card Incident, she was responsible for creating the Hakurei [[Yin-Yang Orb]]s.

;[[Unnamed kitsune]] &amp; [[Unnamed kuda-gitsune]]
In ''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'' Chapter 8, The Unnamed kitsune offered to help Reimu gain worshipers after being caught disguised as Marisa during a party at Hakurei Shrine. She was, however, deceiving Reimu by letting her use the powers of her kuda-gitsune. Using her ability, they gathered worshipers. [[Kasen Ibaraki]] discovered that these fox youkai had been consuming Reimu's willpower and wealth as payment for their help. However, they managed to walk away from the Hakurei Shrine with all her wealth.

==Additional Information==
*Reimu is the most frequent character to appear in the ''[[Touhou Project]]'' games, with [[Marisa Kirisame]] coming second. Reimu appears in every Touhou game, two times more than Marisa, who didn't appear in ''[[Highly Responsive to Prayers]]'' and the minigame ''[[Gold Rush]]''.
*Reimu appears on the cover of all five [[PC-98]] games.
*Reimu seems to be scared during her boss battle with the [[Five Magic Stones]].
*Most of her theme from ''Lotus Land Story'' sounds similar to [[Elis]] and [[Kikuri]]'s theme from ''Highly Responsive to Prayers'', "Magic Mirror".
*It was originally stated that she lives alone at the shrine, but other rarely seen characters ([[Mima]] and [[SinGyoku]]) are known to stay there or near there as well. Even then, Reimu claims that most youkai visitors are nuisances, and she'd prefer to be left alone. [[Marisa Kirisame]] seems to be one of the few who she wouldn't drive away.
*In ''[[Imperishable Night]]'', Reimu is the only one whose partner doesn't mention the danger of the full moon.
*Reimu's ultimate technique {{nihongo|'''Fantasy Nature'''|夢想天生|musou tensei|"innate fantasy gained at birth"}} is homophonous with the ultimate technique of the Hokuto Shinken school in ''[[wikipedia:Fist of the North Star|Fist of the North Star]]'', {{nihongo|'''Musou Tensei'''|無想転生|musou tensei|"nil-thought rebirth"}}, and has much the same effect.
**In ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]'', if you activate Fantasy Nature successfully in a 3rd round, a remix of "Eastern Mystical Love Consultation" will play which resembles ''Ai wo Torimodose'', the opening theme of the ''Fist of the North Star'' anime (an instrumental version of which usually plays whenever Kenshiro is about to win a fight).
*In ''Touhou Hisoutensoku'', one of her alternative palettes looks similar to VIVIT. Also, one of her palettes seems to be another maid homage, [[Ruukoto]], or possibly [[Sanae Kochiya]]'s colours. The palette also seems to resemble Mima from ''[[Highly Responsive to Prayers]]''. Her white/light gray palette seems to resemble [[wikipedia:Toki (Fist of the North Star)#Toki|Toki]] from Hokuto no Ken and possibly somewhat similar to her white outfit from the fangame ''[[Concealed the Conclusion]]''. &lt;!--And finally, her white/light blue palette looks like a tribute to [http://nanoha.wikia.com/wiki/Nanoha_Takamachi Nanoha], as they both tend to "befriend" their opponents with superior firepower.--&gt;
*When playing Yukari's story mode in ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]'', Reimu breaks down in tears in the ending after Yukari defeats [[Tenshi Hinanawi|Tenshi]] and reduces the Hakurei Shrine to rubble for the second time, with [[Sakuya Izayoi|Sakuya]] and [[Youmu Konpaku|Youmu]] looking on helplessly (although Suika offers to help rebuild it). This marks the first and only time where she's seen crying in a storyline scenario.
*The shrine maiden at the end of ''[[Dolls in Pseudo Paradise]]'' is probably Reimu. She has Reimu's title, "Shrine Maiden of Paradise" (and her personality), and according to [[Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red/Music Columns|''Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Music Column]], the shrine maiden in the song that accompanies the ending section is Reimu (so basically, this shrine maiden has Reimu's song and title). However, only the shrine maiden at the end is referred to as the shrine maiden of paradise. Thus it's possible that the shrine maiden seen in the first half of the story is a different person altogether.
*A "13th Shrine Maiden" signs off the Gensokyo Record in [[Perfect Cherry Blossom/Story/Prologue|''Perfect Cherry Blossom'''s prologue]]. [[ZUN]] has stated in [[ZUN's E-mails|an e-mail]] that the Gensokyo Record is unreliable (for one thing, the writing style of each section shows it was written by a different person each time), thus "there's a high possibility that Reimu isn't the 13th Hakurei shrine maiden." (technically, this also means there's no proof that the person who wrote that section of the record is a shrine maiden at all). 
*It' is shown in ''[[Oriental Sacred Place]]'' that the shrine sometimes gets various donations (including wine) from unknown sources (implied to be from the [[Outside World|outside world]], as the [[Hakurei Shrine]] lies on the border) and Yukari is shown in ''Oriental Sacred Place'' to sneak yen donations into the offering box when Reimu isn't looking.
*In [[Wild and Horned Hermit]] chapter 46, Reimu experiences a near-death experience because of food poisoning.
**It is also revealed, in the same chapter, that she has trouble of taking care of herself.
*Reimu appears on most of the series menu/title screen.
*In chapter 7 of ''[[Strange and Bright Nature Deity]]'', she used chopsticks with her left hand, and it was stated that she was left-handed (this statement was deleted in the collected edition), but she held a pen with her right hand in ''Subterranean Animism''. It has been speculated by fans that, assuming this wasn't an art error, she may be ambidextrous or just used to writing with her right hand.
*Shibata Masahiro's manga series "[https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/manga.php?id=1648 Sarai]" seems to be a big inspiration for many of the characters from EoSD . Sarai is a manga about superpowered maids fighting youkai and monsters in a dystopian future. The series was published from 1997 to 2007 in Japan only.
**There is a [https://onsen.touhouwiki.net/wiki/File:Reimu_Sarai.jpeg character] in Sarai that resembles [https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/File:00Reimu2.png Windows Reimu].

She's always involved in some strange affairs, though she seems to be dragged into most of them due to [[Marisa Kirisame|Marisa]]. Reimu pretends not to notice this. She sees Marisa as essentially a hopeless case.

[[Shrine maiden]] of the [[Hakurei Shrine]], and protagonist of the [[Touhou]] series. She appears quite carefree on the outside, and indeed deep down, she really is carefree. She lives in her shrine and is rarely visited by anyone, which causes her to be out of touch with current social norms. Even though she only extinguished certain sparks of conflict because they seemed to befall her without warning, her actions have generally resulted in preventing the residents of [[Gensokyo]] from visiting [[human]] settlements, and keeping outsiders away from wandering into Gensokyo.

Charms and the yin-yang orb are her weapons. Additionally, she has the ability to fly in the air.

'''Reimu Hakurei'''

Abilities: Flying in the air, manipulating auras

The protagonist.

Chronologically, this title isn't too far from the previous title, thus her age stays the same as before.

There is nothing special about her being a [[shrine maiden]]. Or rather, she's a shrine maiden only because the [[Touhou]] series has become the "Shrine Maiden [[Shooting game|Shooting Game]]" series. It feels like the cart has been placed before the horse to me.&lt;br/&gt;

This time, her outfit isn't overly intricate like typical [[shrine maiden]] clothing, but has become quite simple and only remotely resembles that of a shrine maiden. Is she really a shrine maiden?

She's more like "You, red-white!" in my opinion.&lt;br/&gt;

[[Hakurei Shrine]]'s [[shrine maiden]], and the protagonist. Her mind might appear normal, but in fact it's like spring in full bloom.&lt;br/&gt;
The shrine is always haunted by [[youkai]], and they're very friendly to Reimu as well.&lt;br/&gt;

She hates training, and because of this, lacks ability. So her skill is quite so-so.&lt;br/&gt;
She hates to do her very best at anything that falls upon her.&lt;br/&gt;

Charms and the yin-yang orb are her weapons. Additionally, she has the ability to fly in the air.

:She has a smaller [[hit box]], and her focused movement allows player to dodge very precisely.
:Spirit Sign's "Hakurei Amulet" is quite easy to use. It allows you to focus on dodging bullets.
:On the other hand, Dream Sign's "Extermination" wields destructive power of the highest class.
:Bosses are killed quickly, but the invincibility duration of her bombs is the shortest of all characters. It's also lacking in both effective radius and damage.

'''Reimu Hakurei'''

She possess the ability to mainly fly in the air.

Basically, she's a [[shrine maiden]]. The shrine maiden of [[Hakurei Shrine]], which is located on the boundary of [[Gensokyo]].&lt;br/&gt;
The Hakurei Shrine exists in both Gensokyo and the world of [[human]]s at the same time.&lt;br/&gt;
The boundary is the home territory of the Hakurei Shrine. From both sides, it's located at a very remote place from human villages, and is also kind of small, and has no known history or benefits. So it's no wonder that it rarely gets any visitors.&lt;br/&gt;
Inside the shrine, almost all foreign boundaries has been nullified. That alone should say that the Hakurei Boundary, the boundary between Gensokyo and the world of humans, is amazingly powerful.

Only those of the Hakurei have rules to follow in [[Gensokyo]]. Therefore, Reimu always wears clothes that's apparently some kind of uniform (she's supposed to have ''many'' other rules too, though...). Her daily routine consists of wearing red-white, staring at Gensokyo's sky from the edge of Gensokyo, and drinking tea.

By nature, Reimu can use various mysterious powers, but she doesn't use them or boast about them. Everything is, as is, after all.

'''Reimu Hakurei'''

Species: [[Human]]&lt;br/&gt;
Location: [[Hakurei Shrine]]&lt;br/&gt;
Ability: Flying in the air

A typical [[shrine maiden]] from Hakurei Shrine. She always lives on ideas off the top of her head, and doesn't consider something seriously. The only thing she does that actually resembles a shrine maiden's duties is enjoying tea and life on the veranda.

She's quite simple-minded, thus when she's angry she's angry, and when she smiles she smiles. Her open personality makes her well-liked by both [[human]]s and [[youkai]]. Due to that, many people stay close to the shrine.

She lacks training in both melee and spells (or rather, she rarely does them), but she covers that up with the numerous talents she's born with. So she's quite tough, enough to make you wonder if she's really a human. While she warps or uses guided shots, it's all straight from her perspective. What a mean shrine maiden.

[[Hakurei Shrine]]'s [[Shrine Maiden]].&lt;br/&gt;
A [[human]] that lives on the boundary. She has the ability to fly in the air.

She's the shrine maiden of the [[Hakurei Shrine]], which is located at the edge of [[Gensokyo]] and (possibly) has ancient and honourable origins.&lt;br/&gt;
She's emotional and noisy, and has a presence wherever she is, but she merges into her surroundings quite easily.&lt;br/&gt;
Her ability is being able to fly, that is, being weightless.&lt;br/&gt;
The gravity of Earth, any level of stress, and threats of power all mean nothing to her.&lt;br/&gt;
Both her mind and body float in the sky of fantasy, a mysterious [[Shrine Maiden|shrine maiden]].&lt;br/&gt;
However powerful the opponent is, that means nothing in her presence.&lt;br/&gt;
As she evens out whatever status one has, she tends to attract anyone regardless of species, [[human]] or [[youkai]].

Her weapons are amulets and a [[Yin-Yang orb]]. She is also preferred by mosquitoes.

:''Notes''
:She teams with [[Yukari Yakumo|Yukari]] this time.
:Focused speed only applies when she's used as a solo character.
:She lacks a bit in damage, but is quite easy to use and doesn't need much memorization.
:She's quite strong, especially against smaller enemies.
:In a word, dastardly.

'''Reimu Hakurei'''

Species: [[Human]]&lt;br/&gt;
Ability: Mainly flying in the air

The all-too-familiar shrine maiden of the Hakurei Shrine located on the border of Gensokyo. The Hakurei Shrine itself exists simultaneously in both Gensokyo and the Outside World.

She treats everyone fairly and equally, which makes her well-liked by even the feared being such as [[youkai]]. On the flip side, she doesn't see anyone as a comrade. Since there are a great number of humans and youkai around her, there are instances where she works together with them, but even so, she usually does things by herself alone. 
She might just truly be a cold-hearted kind of human...

The all-too-familiar shrine maiden.

The morning that she was expecting to see after a full night's sleep didn't greet her. She thought that something very strange was going on, so she left the shrine to investigate. It's not unusual for her to go out at night, but going out at midnight just after having taken a full night's rest was most unusual. Anyway, nights always make her sleepy, so she'll be going back to bed once the issue is resolved. She followed a trail of power into a bamboo forest, and what she found were very familiar faces...

The all-too-familiar shrine maiden of the Hakurei Shrine.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
She treats everyone basically the same way. However, since her job is hunting [[youkai]], she takes a fairly strict stance against youkai, but she's actually equally uninterested in humans and youkai.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
This time, there's a conspiracy surrounding her gods. She may be their spokesperson, but her circumstances as a youkai hunter are different, so she feels a bit lost.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Her weapons are amulets and yin-yang balls. Her piety seems light.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Her fighting style generally relies on equipment that lends a sense of stability.

これから巫女とそのライバルによる決闘が 行われるというのだ。&lt;br/&gt;
この闘いに勝って人気を不動の物とせよ！

特技　万有霊力の法則

霊力ゲージが他のキャラより長くなっており、&lt;br/&gt;
霊力最大値がアップします。&lt;br/&gt;
射撃攻撃や必殺技をより多く使用でき、&lt;br/&gt;
攻撃をガードして多少霊力を減らされても余裕が出ます。

ラストワード　夢想天生

構えを取って相手の打撃を受け止めて隙を作り、&lt;br/&gt;
大量のお札で包囲して圧殺する霊夢の最終奥義です。&lt;br/&gt;
０距離であれば問答無用にガード不能で発動するため、&lt;br/&gt;
カウンターを恐れて萎縮する相手を突き崩すことも容易です。
| translation ='''The Advocate of the Myriad Gods, Reimu Hakurei'''

The normally calm humans and the always-energetic youkai&lt;br/&gt;
are both in a state of excitement.&lt;br/&gt;
Their blood is boiling for one reason.&lt;br/&gt;
From here on, the shrine maiden and her rivals will be battling it out.&lt;br/&gt;
Emerge victorious in this battle, and acquire unwavering popularity!

'''Special skill: Law of Universal Spirit Power'''

Reimu's spirit power gauge is longer than the other characters',&lt;br/&gt;
so her maximum spirit power is increased.&lt;br/&gt;
She can use more ranged attacks and special attacks,&lt;br/&gt;
and even if she loses some spirit power while guarding attacks, she'll still have more in supply.&lt;br/&gt;

'''Last Word: Fantasy Nature'''

Reimu adopts a stance, and by taking an enemy melee attack, she creates an opening,&lt;br/&gt;
and then surrounds the enemy with massive amounts of ofuda and annihilates them in her most powerful attack.&lt;br/&gt;
If it's at point-blank range, guarding against it is impossible,&lt;br/&gt;
so it's also easy to wear down and flatten opponents fearful of the counter.

It chases enemies on its own to purify them, but since its homing speed is somewhat bad,&lt;br/&gt;

Somehow, it doesn't seem to be very satisfactory as a purification rod.

Her Occult Attack is “The Gap in the Great Hakurei Barrier”.&lt;br/&gt;
It’s a projectile-type attack that opens a gap in mid-air, where from wreckage flies towards the opponent.
Since Reimu herself moves independently from the gap, she can also attack simultaneously.

The all-too-familiar shrine maiden of the Hakurei Shrine.

The lunar emissaries have at last arrived for real.&lt;br /&gt;
Their goals are unknown, but as she's fighting entirely away from home,&lt;br /&gt;
it's obvious that this will be the first truly difficult battle for her in a long while.

This time, she's forced to fight a battle with no room for error.

Frankly, the cherry blossoms blooming at the shrine don't bother her,&lt;br/&gt;

That conceit leads her to severely misjudge the true nature of the incident.

The all-too-familiar shrine maiden of the Hakurei Shrine.

Beast spirits had begun to invade from Hell en masse.&lt;br&gt;
A beast spirit that was cooperative with humans told her that it'd lend her its power, so she decided to go to Hell.&lt;br&gt;
She wasn't completely convinced by what the spirit had told her, but she would be more powerful than if she went to Hell by herself, and she could always just defeat the beast spirit itself if things came to that, so she decided that it didn't pose any disadvantage to her.

Mysterious cards were circulating in the streets.&lt;br&gt;
She sensed that the secrets of humans and youkai were hidden within the cards, and felt she had no choice but to investigate.&lt;br&gt;
For starters, her plan was to search around wherever she could for those selling the cards, and seize them en masse.

| translation = Our infamous protagonist. She appears throughout most of the series. In the 6th title of the series, EoSD, I changed Reimu's design a lot and she became quite different compared to Reimu in previous titles. You can say she's Reimu reintroduced.&lt;br/&gt;
She's supposed to be a powerhouse, yet she's unreliable here and there. She's supposed to be the youkai exterminator, yet she's more liked by youkai than humans in comparison. With those traits, she shows her charm through such frivolity. If Reimu were the conventional type of protagonist who's dead serious about justice while having tons of companions, we'd be talking about a completely different story that is nothing like Touhou.

{{nihongo|'''Reisen'''|レイセン}} is a [[Rabbit|lunar rabbit]] from the [[Touhou Bougetsushou]] series. 

==General Information==
[[File:SSIBReiSen2.png|thumb|200px|left|Reisen "vanishing" in ''[[Silent Sinner in Blue]]'']]
===Abilities===
;[[Moon rabbit]] abilities
Moon rabbits can send "ESP waves" and receive them with their ears, forming a sort of psychic network where they share feelings and rumors.
;Vanishing(?)
In Chapter 2 of ''[[Silent Sinner in Blue]]'', Reisen is shown to vanish from Reimu's sight and appear behind her. It is unclear whether this is a display of speed, teleportation or some other ability.

==Background Information==
===Name===
{{nihongo|"Reisen"|レイセン}} is in fact not her original name, but is the name she received when she became the Watatsuki sisters' pet. Her original name has not been revealed. The unofficial romaji "Reisen" is used to distinguish the name from {{nihongo||鈴仙|reisen}}, used in [[Reisen Udongein Inaba]]'s name, through different spelling with identical pronunciation.

===Design===
Reisen has short hair, light purple and red eyes. White fluffy rabbit ears, lacking the button-like decorations normally worn by members of the Lunar Defense Corps. Wears a black business suit over her shirt, similar to [[Reisen Udongein Inaba]], and a gray skirt.

==Story==
;Silent Sinner in Blue
:{{Main|Silent Sinner in Blue}}
Reisen fled to Earth from the Moon early in the events of ''[[Silent Sinner in Blue]]''. She was nursed back to health by [[Reimu Hakurei|Reimu]] after being injured by space debris during her travel. Because of this, [[Eirin Yagokoro]] was able to learn of her presence. Since Reisen still had attachments to the moon, Eirin sent her back along with a letter for the Watatsuki sisters, warning them of [[Yukari Yakumo]]'s imminent invasion. Since fleeing to Earth was a crime, she was sentenced to live as the Watatsuki sisters' pet where she was then given the name Reisen, the same name as their former pet (who is currently known as [[Reisen Udongein Inaba]]).

Reisen later appears alongside [[Watatsuki no Toyohime]] when she confronts [[Yukari Yakumo]], and then appears again attempting to deliver a letter to [[Eirin Yagokoro]] before being confronted by Tewi.

;Cage in Lunatic Runagate
:{{Main|Cage in Lunatic Runagate}}
In the [[Cage in Lunatic Runagate/First Chapter|first chapter]] of ''[[Cage in Lunatic Runagate]]'', [[Eirin Yagokoro]] spots Reisen's [[Lunar Veil]] as she travels to Earth. Shortly afterwards, [[Reimu Hakurei]] arrives claiming to have found an injured [[rabbit]], but none of [[Tewi]]'s rabbits are missing. Connecting the dots, Eirin convinces Reimu that the rabbit is actually a [[fox]] or [[tanuki]] trying to trick her, before making preparations to meet up with Reisen herself.

Reisen later appears as the viewpoint character of [[Cage in Lunatic Runagate/Sixth Chapter|chapter six]] where she reminisces on the events which lead her to run away from the moon, as well as the new things she's been experiencing under the Watatsuki sisters' tutelage. Reisen observes a battle between [[Marisa Kirisame]] and [[Watatsuki no Yorihime]], after which Yorihime sends her to prepare a letter to Eirin. Unable to find [[Toyohime]] at the Watatsukis' mansion, Reisen writes the letter by herself. However, after leaving the mansion she somehow encounters Toyohime in a dark forest, apparently on Earth, and is told to "watch what's about to happen".

==Relationships==
;[[Watatsuki no Yorihime]] &amp; [[Watatsuki no Toyohime]] (Owner)
Reisen's current owners. Rather than report Reisen for her desertion because she was sick of pounding mochi, they "punished" Reisen by making her join the Lunar Defense Corps. They both decided to adopt her as well.
;[[Reisen Udongein Inaba]] (Namesake)
Reisen replaced Reisen Udongein Inaba as the Watatsuki's pet after she deserted the Moon, making her a successor of sorts.

==Additional Information==
*During her first appearance in ''[[Silent Sinner in Blue]]'' chapters 1-2, this rabbit who would later be given the name Reisen. She wore a dress very similar to [[Tewi Inaba]]'s because she wanted to disguise herself as an Earth rabbit.

{{nihongo|'''Reisen Udongein Inaba'''|鈴仙・優曇華院・イナバ}} is one of the [[moon rabbit]]s who fled from the [[Moon]] to Earth as a refugee from the "Lunar War" between the two worlds that began in 1969 A.D. after the [[Wikipedia:Apollo 11|Apollo 11]] "invasion". Making her way to [[Gensokyo]], she was surprised to meet the notorious fugitives [[Kaguya Houraisan]] and [[Eirin Yagokoro]], and asked for asylum in [[Eientei]]. In exchange, she works for and protects Kaguya and Eirin.

==General Information==
Reisen first appeared as the Stage 5 [[boss]] ''[[Imperishable Night]]'' and later became playable in ''[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]'', ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]'', ''[[Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom]]'' and the PlayStation 4 version of ''[[Urban Legend in Limbo]]''. She also appears in many official manga such as ''[[Silent Sinner in Blue]]'', ''[[Cage in Lunatic Runagate]]'' and ''[[Inaba of the Moon and Inaba of the Earth]]''.

===Personality=== 
Despite her insanity-inducing abilities, she is actually a rather balanced and thoughtful individual. She has a high level of generalized anxiety, and appears to be constantly afraid of being punished by her superiors, as seen in her bad ending of [[Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom]]. This may be due to her history of being slave in the [[Lunar Capital]] and a contributing factor to why she fled in the first place. Despite her relative degree of freedom while living at [[Eientei]] in [[Gensokyo]], she still desires to make herself useful to others as much as possible, even at personal expense.

===Abilities===
;Manipulation of Wavelengths/Insanity
Reisen has the ability to sense and manipulate waves of all kinds, her red eyes often acting as a means of inducing insanity. Her signature use of this ability is manipulating another person's perception to the point of inducing madness or hallucinations depending on the strength of her opponent's will. By increasing the frequency of brainwaves she can make a person short-tempered and irrational, or by reducing them can leave her target apathetic and depressed.

Reisen can also manipulate light and sound waves to deceive the senses such as by concealing the paths of her [[danmaku]], to creating after-images of herself, to casting wide-area illusions that cause people to get lost. Finally, she is capable of releasing waves from her eyes in a destructive blast. 

Reisen is immune to the abilities of the [[Three Fairies of Light]] (seeing an invisible [[Sunny Milk]], hearing a silent [[Luna Child]] and escaping [[Star Sapphire]]'s detection) since they are based on waves, though she seems unable to replicate [[Star Sapphire]]'s abilities with her own.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Strange and Bright Nature Deity]]'': Chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt;

;[[Moon rabbit]] abilities
Moon rabbits can send "ESP waves" and receive them with their ears, forming a sort of psychic network where they share feelings and rumors. Reisen can still participate in this network despite the physical and spiritual distance between [[Gensokyo]] and the [[Moon]].

===Occupation===
Formerly Reisen was a Moon Rabbit in service of the Lunarians. Moon Rabbits are seen as tools by Lunarians and are used for a large variety of menial labour including farming, pounding medicine, cleaning and as soldiers in the Moon's war effort. However, sometime in the Lunar War, Reisen deserted the Lunar Capital and fled to Earth.

After seeking refuge from Eientei, Reisen now serves Eirin and Kaguya. She effectively performs as their housekeeper doing manual errands for them. Eirin operates as Reisen's mentor in medicines. She also sends her to the Human Village where she sells medicine to humans at an affordable price.

===Possessions===
;Megaphone-shaped Handgun
Starting with ''Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom'', Reisen equips a handgun in a shape of a megaphone. She uses to fire bullets and mainly soundwaves at her foes. It can change the size to function as a shotgun and even use like a real megaphone. Reisen has two in her possession which she dual-wields. &lt;ref&gt; [[Antinomy of Common Flowers]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Species===
Throughout the ''[[Touhou Project]]'', she is always referred to as a [[moon rabbit]]. However, in ''[[Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom]]'', Reisen realizes that living on Earth for too long has tainted her with [[impurity]]. This allows her to save the [[Lunar Capital]], as only someone with impurity could face [[Junko]], the game's primary antagonist. Knowing that she can no longer return to the [[Lunar Capital]] or being a moon rabbit again, she now proudly proclaims herself to be an earth rabbit of [[Gensokyo]].&lt;ref name="LoLK"&gt;''[[Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom]]'': [[Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom/Story/Reisen's Scenario|Reisen's Scenario]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character Design==
[[File:PMiSS reisen.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Reisen, as illustrated in ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]''.]]
===Name===
Her full name is {{nihongo|''Reisen Udongein Inaba''|鈴仙・優曇華院・イナバ}}, which is often abbreviated to {{nihongo|''Reisen U. Inaba''|鈴仙・Ｕ・イナバ}}. Originally, her name was written in katakana as {{nihongo|"Reisen"|レイセン}}, but in order to blend in on Earth, she [[wikipedia:Ateji|changed the spelling]] to {{nihongo|"Reisen"|鈴仙}} and adopted the surname {{nihongo|"Udongein"|優曇華院}} from [[Eirin Yagokoro]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Cage in Lunatic Runagate]]'': [[Cage in Lunatic Runagate/First Chapter|Chapter One]]&lt;/ref&gt; Note that "gein" is pronounced the same way as the English word "gain"; her name should be written as "Udonge'in" in romaji and possibly as "{{lang|fr|Udongeïn}}" in French ― the noun "udonge" and the suffix "-in" are analyzed to the different morphemes and it keeps the two vowel's separation. {{nihongo|"Inaba"|イナバ}}, drawn from [[Tewi Inaba]], is a name [[Kaguya Houraisan]] uses for all the rabbits in Eientei as she has trouble distinguishing between them.

In canon, [[Eirin Yagokoro]] is the only one who is allowed to call Reisen by the name "Udonge" or "Udongein", though she also calls her "Reisen" from time to time, particularly when she is not present. Kaguya is seen to use both "Inaba" and "Reisen".

The characters for ''Reisen'' literally mean something like "bell hermit", and ''Udongein'' "house of plantain flowers". Titles ending in {{nihongo|院|"-in"}} were typically granted to Japanese noblewomen in their old age to indicate their special contribution to a temple or their high place in society, and carry a sense of great nobility and culture. This title is similar to posthumous names, called {{nihongo||院号|[[wikipedia:ja:院号|ingou]]}}; examples include [[wikipedia:Taira no Tokuko|Kenreimon-In]] and [[wikipedia:ja:待賢門院堀河|Taikenmon-In]].

There are several theories of where the name ''Reisen'' came from.
* {{nihongo||醴泉|reisen}}, meaning "spring of sweet water" - some say that this was the source of the immortality elixir in the Chinese legend of [[Chang'e]].
* {{nihongo||霊蟾|reisen}}, meaning "spirit toad", but which due to a confusion led by the kanji is now used to refer to [[moon rabbit]]s or the Moon itself.
* {{nihongo||冷戦|reisen}}, meaning "[[wikipedia:Cold_War|Cold War]]", the time at which [[human]] exploration of the Moon started. (see the notes on [[Imperishable Night/Spell Cards/Stage 5|Reisen's spell cards]]).
* {{nihongo||零戦|reisen|also called zero-sen}}, meaning "Zero-Fighter", a nickname for the famous [[wikipedia:Mitsubishi A6M Zero|Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighter plane]], which may be a reference to Reisen's military background (see also [[Imperishable Night/Music]]). However, this name connection has been stated to be irrelevant by ZUN in [[Strange_Creators_of_Outer_World/Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom_interview_with_ZUN|Strange Creators of Outer World]].
Incidentally, in German ''[[Wiktionary:reisen|reisen]]'' means "travels" or "voyages" as well as "to travel". There is also a species of rabbit known as the ''Deutsche Riesen'' (German), but this origin is generally thought unlikely. More loosely, ''reisen'' is a definite singular for ''reise'' in Norwegian, which means "journey" or "trip".

===Design===
In ''[[Imperishable Night]]'' Reisen has red eyes, long light-purple hair and long rumpled rabbit ears - like all members of the Lunar Defense Corps&lt;ref&gt;''[[Silent Sinner in Blue]]'' chapter 8&lt;/ref&gt;, her ears stand up straight and are decorated with two accoutrement-like buttons. Her outfit consists of a long-sleeved black business suit over a white shirt, along with a beige skirt, white socks and red shoes. Her left lapel is decorated with a crescent moon-shaped insignia, and a pocket square in her left shirt pocket.

In ''[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]'' Reisen's jacket is removed and she wears a purple skirt. There is a clip on her necktie in the shape of a carrot, identical to [[Tewi Inaba]]'s. Her alternate outfit makes her shirt black and her tie yellow.

In ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]'', she wears a short-sleeved white shirt, a red belt and a blue skirt. Her alternate outfit gives her a dark green dress, ears and eyes, and a light green shirt and hair.

In ''[[Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom]]'', she wears the same short-sleeved shirt, but with a violet belt and a light red skirt.

In ''[[Urban Legend in Limbo]]'', she wears an outfit similar to her previous playable appearance, with the exception of her skirt, which now has a white horizontal stripe near the bottom of the skirt, and her belt, which is now red. The carrot-shaped necktie clip is larger compared to her previous one. Her hair now reaches past her legs and her socks are now unfolded and reaches her knee. Her tail is noticably large in her artwork in the game.

==Appearances==
===Games===
;''Imperishable Night''
[[File:Th08ReisenBoss.png|frame|Reisen's sprite in ''IN'']]
Reisen's début was in ''[[Imperishable Night]]'' as the [[stage]] 5 [[boss]]. Here, Reisen hid within [[Eientei]] to avoid any lunar emissaries that might arrive on Earth and force her to return to the [[Moon]]. She was tasked with sealing the doors inside Eientei to ensure that [[Kaguya Houraisan]] could not be found by the emissaries either. She used her power of insanity to stop the heroines from invading Eientei, but was defeated. Reisen's power of insanity comes from her eyes; she uses them to refract and twist waves, disorienting and confusing her victims and deceiving them with frightening illusions. Unfortunately for Eientei, she forgot to seal the door that Kaguya was hiding in, and thus the heroine was able to enter it.

;''Phantasmagoria of Flower View''
[[File:Th09ReisenBoss.png|frame|Reisen's sprite in ''PoFV'']]
[[File:Th09ReisenPlayer.png|frame|Reisen's back sprite in ''PoFV'' &amp; ''LoLK'']]
{{Main|Phantasmagoria of Flower View/Story#Reisen and Tewi's Story|l1=Phantasmagoria of Flower View Story}}
In ''[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]'', she worries about [[Tewi Inaba]] running off and seems more level headed than most other characters. Although she doesn't know what's causing the flower incident, she's decided to investigate by going wherever the flowers are blooming.

;''Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom''
{{main|Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom/Story/Reisen's Scenario|l1=Reisen's Scenario}}
Reisen returns as the fourth playable character in ''[[Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom]]''. When playing as her, she can shoot white bullets upwards and have purple bullets spread as a wide shot. If focused, all her bullets will shoot directly vertical. She has eyes and surround her to shoot the purple bullets, and if her power increases, she can shoot more bullets. Her bomb is unique in that, rather than turning invincible and damaging enemies, she'll instead have three red rings around that, basically, gives her three extra lives. If all lives aren't used by the end of the stage, then the bomb will end.

In her scenario, like her human allies, Reisen is given the [[Ultramarine Orb Elixir]] by [[Eirin Yagokoro]] and she was ordered to travel to the [[Moon]] and stop the incoming invasion from the [[Lunar Capital]]. She knew how to get there; use the [[Dream World]]. After taking care of [[Seiran]] and [[Ringo]] on the [[Youkai Mountain]], she bumps into [[Doremy Sweet]] in the Dream World. After defeating her, she finally makes it to the Lunar Capital, realising that the place is empty. There, she encounters [[Sagume Kishin]], who after tests her ability, gives her a new mission to save the Lunar Capital from its own invaders. This is why the capital is invading [[Gensokyo]]. Due to her [[impurity]], she is able to confront the one behind the incident. She flies over the [[Sea of Tranquility]] and takes care of [[Fairy|fairies]] from [[Hell]], including [[Clownpiece]]. She then confronts [[Junko]], the one Eirin and Sagume wanted Reisen to take care of. Eventually, she is finally defeated.

In the Extra stage, the [[lunarian]]s have yet to return from the fake capital in the Dream World; this is because [[Hecatia Lapislazuli]] kept them sealed away. After fighting her along with Junko through a long battle, they were finally defeated.

===Spin-offs===
;''Shoot the Bullet''
In ''[[Shoot the Bullet]]'', [[Aya Shameimaru]] encountered Reisen on [[stage]] 4 and took photos of her [[danmaku]].

;''Scarlet Weather Rhapsody''
{{Main|Scarlet Weather Rhapsody/Story#Reisen's Story|l1=Scarlet Weather Rhapsody Story}}
During the events in ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]'', she appears in the [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]] to ask questions but is beaten by the furious Mistress. Later she inquires into the fate of the [[Hakurei Shrine]] and asks if the earthquakes are still going on.  Failing to find clues, she later goes to [[Hakugyokurou]] to check its condition and to ask [[Yuyuko Saigyouji]] about the Shrine's destruction. She tells her about the "completion ceremony" of the new shrine, but when she goes there, the shrine is destroyed. She also meets [[Yukari Yakumo]], who forbids her to investigate the shrine. Some time after the battle with Yukari, [[Tenshi Hinanawi]] suddenly appears and tells Reisen that earthquakes are just "fine".

;''Touhou Hisoutensoku''
[[File:Th135Reisen.png|frame|Reisen in ''HM'']]
:{{Main|Touhou Hisoutensoku/Translation/Reisen's Script|l1=Touhou Hisoutensoku Story}}
If connecting ''SWR'' with ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]'', then Reisen can become a selectable character to play with, although she appears in no scenarios.

;''Hopeless Masquerade''
Reisen made a background cameo appearance in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'' on the [[Human Village]] stage. She is seen sitting with [[Tewi Inaba]], [[Eirin Yagokoro]], and [[Kaguya Houraisan]], waking up Kaguya who falls sleep from time to time.

;''Urban Legend in Limbo''
Reisen made her return in the PlayStation 4 version of ''[[Urban Legend in Limbo]]'' as a console-exclusive character. Her story focuses on the events after [[Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom]]. Her urban legend is "[[wikipedia:Kunekune (urban legend)|Kunekune]]".

;''Antinomy of Common Flowers''
Reisen's [[Dream World]] self escapes to Gensokyo and goes on a rampage, fighting everyone she comes across. As beings in their dreams are much more honest and emotionally unstable than in reality, this Reisen shows much more anger. The real Reisen is an opponent in a couple of other scenarios, as well.

===Literature===
;''Forbidden Scrollery''
In ''[[Forbidden Scrollery]]'', Reisen appears as a traveling salesperson, dressing incognito in traditional Japanese peasant clothing, selling small cat-shaped devices that supposedly ward off mice and other pests by harnessing moonlight as a power source.

;''Alternative Facts in Eastern Utopia''
In ''[[Alternative Facts in Eastern Utopia]]'', [[Aya Shameimaru]] writes multiple articles describing Reisen and the other residents of [[Eientei]] as being "immigrant drug dealers." The articles are never publicly published.

;''Strange and Bright Nature Deity''
In ''[[Strange and Bright Nature Deity]]'' Chapter 3, the [[Three Fairies of Light]] were rabbit hunting in the [[Bamboo Forest of the Lost]] until they bump into Reisen. Confused about why [[Star Sapphire]] couldn't detect Reisen, they run away from there. They are easy followed by Reisen, who guessed they were lost. She helps them get out of the forest, without losing the opportunity of complaining about [[Tewi Inaba]], who she was looking for since the beginning.

;''Foul Detective Satori''
In ''[[Foul Detective Satori]]'', Reisen appears as [[Eientei]]'s gatekeeper, following [[Eirin Yagokoro]]'s order. She later lead [[Orin]] to the place where they held the intruder from the night before, then stop [[Orin]] when she tried to contact with the intruder fearing that she could get possessed by the culprit.

==Relationships==
===[[Kaguya Houraisan]]===
Kaguya and Eirin took Reisen in when Reisen fled from the moon. Although Reisen does answer to Kaguya, their relationship is not as formal as the ones Reisen experienced on the moon with her former masters, and Kaguya seems to give her much more free reign.

===[[Eirin Yagokoro]]=== 
Reisen's current master. Eirin has employed Reisen's telepathic abilities to gain intelligence on the Lunar capital.  She also sends Reisen to the Human Village to sell her medicine.

===[[Tewi Inaba]]=== 
Reisen helps Tewi manage the rabbits at Eientei, though Tewi's carefree nature seems to bother her.

===[[Fujiwara no Mokou]]===
Given Reisen's proximity to [[Kaguya Houraisan]], it would be expected that Mokou might have negative feelings towards Reisen, but in their exchanges in ''[[Antinomy of Common Flowers]]'', Mokou seems to think kindly upon Reisen despite her affiliations.

===[[Lunar Capital]] Relations=== 
[[Watatsuki no Toyohime]] and [[Watatsuki no Yorihime]] were Reisen's former masters before Reisen fled to Earth. Despite her desertion, both sisters fondly miss her.

In ''[[Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom]]'', she's shown indication of already knowing [[Seiran]] and [[Ringo]], two [[moon rabbit]]s, although little of their relationship with her is known. Additionally, despite having fallen to Earth and no longer having any status as a moon rabbit due to her impurity, she seems to still hold a high degree of reverence for [[Sagume Kishin]], referring to her as {{nihongo|"Lady Sagume|サグメ様|Sagume-sama}}, and is willing to carry out Sagume's order to save the [[Lunar Capital]] regardless.

==Additional Information==
*Reisen's right hand is often depicted to be making a gun shape, which leads to fan assumption that she shoots [[danmaku]] in this manner, and she indeed does in ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]''. Some fans even depict Reisen holding an actual handgun in artwork. Those are all based on [[ZUN]]'s word that her normal shots were modeled after a bullet. The revelation in ''[[Silent Sinner in Blue]]'' that all Moon Defense Corps Rabbits are drilled with rifles suggests that Reisen can also use the real thing.
*In ''[[Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom]]'' she is effectively seen holding what seems to be a bunny-themed handgun. Same goes for the PlayStation 4 version of ''[[Urban Legend in Limbo]]'' where she is seen holding a rifle, complete with a magazine, that resembles her bunny-looking handgun. In both Urban Legend in Limbo and in ''[[Antinomy of Common Flowers]]'', the handgun is seemingly able to transform into several different variants, including an automatic rifle and shotgun. Reisen is also seen dual-wielding the handguns in some attacks, so it's likely she has more than one. It's unknown whether she took them from the [[Lunar Capital]] when she fled or if somebody else made them.
*Reisen's alternate outfit in ''Scarlet Weather Rhapsody'' and ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]'' is a homage to the [http://vocaloid.wikia.com/wiki/Vocaloid Vocaloid] [http://vocaloid.wikia.com/wiki/Miku_Hatsune Miku Hatsune]. Her other alternate outfits in Hisoutensoku are also homages to fellow Vocaloids [http://vocaloid.wikia.com/wiki/Rin%2FLen_Kagamine Rin and Len Kagamine], [http://vocaloid.wikia.com/wiki/Luka_Megurine Luka Megurine], [http://vocaloid.wikia.com/wiki/Meiko Meiko], [http://vocaloid.wikia.com/wiki/Kaito Kaito], [http://vocaloid.wikia.com/wiki/Gakupo_Kamui Gakupo Kamui] and [http://vocaloid.wikia.com/wiki/Gumi Gumi].
*In ''[[Urban Legend in Limbo]]'', Reisen has an alternate color palette that resembles her outfit in ''Scarlet Weather Rhapsody'', one that resembles [[Houraisan Kaguya]] and another that resembles Hatsune Miku.
*In her official profile of ''[[Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom]]'', despite Reisen being a [[moon rabbit]], she is marked as a [[human]]. This was stated to be an error by [[ZUN]] on the 28 May 2015 session of [[Nikenme Radio]].

'''Reisen Udongein Inaba'''

Species: Moon Rabbit&lt;br /&gt;
Abilities: Manipulating insanity {{sic}}

A rabbit who lived on the moon. In her eyes dwell far greater power of insanity than the rabbits of the earth.

She is currently the pet of [[Kaguya Houraisan|Kaguya]]. Although real name is simply Reisen (レイセン, in ''katakana''), she has adopted the admittedly quite contrived ''kanji'' spelling 鈴仙 in order to blend in among the earthlings.

"Udongein" is the nickname given to her by [[Eirin Yagokoro|Eirin]]. The reasons for this are unknown. who affectionately also calls her "Udonge." Why one would casually assign a nickname only to abbreviate it is also unknown. The thoughts of an alien are difficult to fathom.

"Inaba" is a nickname given to her by Kaguya gave her. In fact, Kaguya calls all rabbits "Inaba", and makes no distinction between Reisen and [[Tewi Inaba | Tewi]] when she says the name—though it seems she makes no such distinction in any case. Perhaps all rabbits are the same to her.

Reisen is a moon-rabbit who fled the moon after the beginning of the Earthling invasion, of which a detailed account may be found in [[Kaguya Houraisan | Kaguya's profile]].

A rabbit from the moon.

In her red eyes dwell far greater power of insanity than the rabbits of the earth.

Flowers are blooming all over Gensokyo so the rabbits of Eientei went into an uproar. This couldn't be left uninvestigated, so she went out to investigate.

While she's at it, since Tewi disappeared, she's also going to bring her back if she can.

Race: moon rabbit&lt;br/&gt;
Place of residence: Eientei&lt;br/&gt;
Ability: Manipulating insanity

It's common knowledge that light is made of waves, but there's more to sight than just that.
Space itself is waves, and the creatures, things, and of course, light in it are also all made of waves.

Naturally, the thoughts and feelings of living things also consist of waves, and their wavelengths determine personalities.

Reisen can tamper with these waves.

Short wavelengths induce madness, and long wavelengths induce an easygoing nature. And, if you completely invert the waves' phases ... she can completely disappear from her opponent's perception.


Personality: Both carefree and crazed.  Is a different person in battle.

Since she is not originally a creature of Earth, she cannot get along with humans very well.
She can change her personality completely to match her circumstances.

Though she has never been friendly, she sometimes shows her dumb side just like Reimu.

{{nihongo|'''Remilia Scarlet'''|レミリア・スカーレット|Remiria Sukāretto}} is the main antagonist of ''[[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]]''. She's a [[vampire]] and the owner and head of the [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]], the mistress of [[Sakuya Izayoi]], [[Hong Meiling]] and the [[Fairy Maid|fairy maids]]. She's also the older sister (and guardian) of [[Flandre Scarlet]].

==General Information==
Remilia first appeared as the Final [[Boss]] in ''[[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]]''. She later became a playable character in ''[[Immaterial and Missing Power]]'', ''[[Imperishable Night]]'' (along with [[Sakuya]] as a duo) and ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]''. She was also a [[Stage]] 7 target in ''[[Shoot the Bullet]]'' and a Final Day boss in ''[[Impossible Spell Card]]'', along with been in the background of ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]''. Due to being a vampire, she usually appears at night, indoors or under a parasol when the sun is out. She is seldom seen without a parasol on a sunny day outdoors.

While her appearance (and often speech and behavior) may portray her as childlike and non-threatening, she has fearsome magical powers and a reputation to match. According to Akyuu she evaporates when exposed to sunlight (although [[Hieda no Akyuu]] mentioned that she can reabsorb the lost residue). However, it was shown in ''[[Silent Sinner in Blue]]'' that she only begins to smoke under sunlight, and didn't suffer any lethal injuries after being hit with Amaterasu's light. Regardless, she typically remains inside the [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]] (which has few windows to prevent light getting in) during the day and emerges during the night. While she is naturally known to drink [[human]] blood, with a particular preference for [[wikipedia:ABO blood group system|B-type blood]], her light appetite means her victims rarely die from their wounds. However, since she tends to stain her clothes a deep scarlet from the blood, she is also known to be called the {{nihongo|'''Scarlet Devil'''|紅い悪魔|Akai akuma}}.

===Personality===
[[File:Charisma Break!.png|thumb|left|150px|Remilia's childish crouching block in ''[[Immaterial and Missing Power]]'']]
While she tries to cultivate the image of a mysterious and frightening vampire aristocrat, Remilia is as childish as her appearance suggests. However, she is surprisingly polite. Her long lifetime has only served to make her prone to boredom and as a result she prizes anything she finds novel. In ''[[Silent Sinner in Blue]]'' she allows herself to be manipulated by [[Yukari Yakumo]], simply because the alternative would have been boring. The other residents of the [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]] spend much of their time catering to Remilia's odd whims (including numerous parties), though she does make an effort to appreciate and respect their patience.

Remilia is respected by most youkai of Gensokyo and so she's said to have a [[wiktionary:charisma|charismatic]] personality. However, in reality this is only because of the fear they have for her kind. While she can act in an overblown and grandiose fashion, she usually only does it during incidents or for important matters. Otherwise, she tends to exhibit childish behavior&lt;ref&gt;[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody/Story/Remilia's Scenario|Remilia's Scenario in Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]&lt;/ref&gt;. She enjoys novel things and isn't above playing along in silly games&lt;ref&gt;[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody/Story/Aya's Scenario#Stage 4|Stage 4 of Aya's Story Mode in Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]&lt;/ref&gt; or allowing herself to be manipulated if it means staving off boredom.

Her behavior may be due to the fact she actually has the wisdom of a 500 year old being with the personality of a bratty child. Yet, it remains to be said that she has an overflowing and charming personality that even makes most fairies stick around as employees despite their freedom to leave at any time.

===Abilities===
[[File:GoMIllus-Remilia.jpg|thumb|192px|Remilia in red magic, as illustrated in ''[[The Grimoire of Marisa]]''.]]
; Abilities As a vampire
Remilia has tremendous physical abilities (superhuman strength and speed) and magical power. According to ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'', vampires have the strength of [[oni]] and the speed of [[tengu]], that allow them to uproot a thousand-year-old tree single-handedly and to run through the [[Human Village]] in a flash. While the true extent of these capabilities is unknown, Remilia's profile in ''[[Immaterial and Missing Power]]'' describes her as being ''"faster than the eye can follow, and strong enough to crush boulders"&lt;ref name="IaMPomake"&gt;[[Immaterial and Missing Power]]: {{lang|ja|上海アリス通信}}.txt&lt;/ref&gt;'', and in ''[[Silent Sinner in Blue]]'' she claimed that she was able to fly around the [[Moon]] (or at least around its "fantastic" version) in an extremely short period of time. Vampires also have the ability to summon and manipulate a great number of [[devil]]s with a single shout&lt;ref name="PMiSSVampire"&gt;''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'': [[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Vampire|Vampire]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IaMPomake" /&gt;, and to turn into a swarm of bats or even mist to escape or dodge an attack. Additionally, as long as their head remains intact they can regrow the entire body in just one night. Because vampires possess all of these capabilities, they are among one of the strongest species in Gensokyo.&lt;ref name="PMiSSVampire" /&gt;

Like most [[vampire]]s, Remilia has the power of shape-shifting at her disposal and can change into a bat. However, unlike most vampires, her wings remain visible even when she is in [[human]] form, making it impossible to pass herself off completely as a human.

Because she has the ability to summon and manipulate devils, it would be natural for her employing them in great numbers. However, the [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]] currently only has [[Koakuma|one little devil]], usually seen around the library of the mansion, in employment. It remains a mystery as to why so many [[Fairy Maid|fairy maids]] are employed instead.

Vampires like Remilia are also immortal, as they forfeit growth and maturity in exchange for eternal life.&lt;ref&gt;[[Imperishable Night]]: Manual&lt;/ref&gt;

;Manipulation of Fate
In the current world view of [[Gensokyo]], there isn't detailed information concerning this ability nor an instance where Remilia clearly used it. Consequently, what this ability actually entails is quite uncertain. If the power is as potent as it suggests, then for any enemies that she confronts, she should be able to change fate to her advantage so that she would always win. However, since Remilia does sometimes lose, this does not seem to be the case. This could just be because of the [[spell card]] rules, however (similar to how [[Reimu Hakurei]] is not allowed to easily win any battle by using her ability to float out of reality before [[Marisa Kirisame]] came out with ''[[Imperishable_Night/Spell_Cards/Last_Word#Spell_Card_215|Fantasy Nature]]'', which has a time limit and thus is not completely unbeatable).  It is unclear whether Remilia manipulates it intentionally or if she can only change the fate of things around her without being aware of doing so. Thus, there exist speculation as to whether she truly can use it. The best representation of this ability being used would be in several of her spell cards where she uses red chains that chase the enemy (chains are commonly associated with destiny).

According to [[Hieda no Akyuu]] in ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'', it seems to be that those in her vicinity will be followed by bad fortune. This may be a "use" of her ability similar to [[Hina Kagiyama]]'s ability to spread curses and misfortune by merely being close to someone. However, this is not an effect that can be quantified. Akyuu also states that Remilia can bring great changes in one's daily life with nothing more than a word but as mentioned before, it is still something that can't be measurable. As such, no one can know when or if she's actually doing it. In ''[[Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red]]'', according to her little sister [[Flandre Scarlet]], the true nature of the ability may simply be to know what happens in the future. However, Flandre also said that it's just that "she [Remilia] just likes to talk that way" and thus may just be an act of pretense.

==Backstory==
Remilia's past prior to her arrival at [[Gensokyo]] is unclear, but her name, appearance, house, and clothing imply she is [[wikipedia:Europe|European]] in origin, and she has been stated to have come from "the west"&lt;ref&gt;[[Symposium_of_Post-mysticism/Afterword_by_Hieda_no_Akyuu|Symposium of Post-Mysticism: Afterword by Hieda no Akyu]]. "the vampires that came from the West"&lt;/ref&gt;. She has been the mistress of the [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]] for about 500 years. She claims to be a descendant of one of the world's most notorious [[vampire]]s: [[wikipedia:Vlad the Impaler|Count Vlad Ţepeş Dracul]]. However, unknown to the people of [[Gensokyo]], this is a complete lie.

===Remilia and "The Vampire Incident"=== 

It is not known how Remilia came to Gensokyo in the first place, but the Scarlet Devil Mansion (and thus presumably Remilia herself) were in Gensokyo at least as early as 1998. It is also known that when she came to Gensokyo, the [[Great Hakurei Barrier]] (erected in 1885) had been in place for a while, as at this point in [[Gensokyo Timeline|Gensokyo's history]], the [[youkai]] had lost much of their power from being unable to attack [[human]]s.

Upon arriving in Gensokyo, Remilia quickly gathered many subordinates and proceeded to go on a rampage. However, she was eventually defeated by powerful youkai. They settled on a devil's contract where the youkai would give her [[human]]s for food, and in exchange she would not attack the humans of Gensokyo. Such prohibition proved distasteful to many youkai, which led to talks with [[Reimu Hakurei]] to establish a set of ground rules for battle (It is unclear if Remilia was involved in these discussions). This culminated in the creation of the [[spell card]] rules. In 2003, almost immediately afterwards, another plot of Remilia's would lead to the first incident that used the system.

At the time In ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'', Remilia was never directly stated to be the vampire behind "the Vampire Incident" (where a vampire first arrived and went on a rampage), so it was technically unconfirmed whether it was Remilia. [[Hieda no Akyuu]] states that any reference to the vampires in [[Gensokyo]] must be referencing the Scarlet family, which could mean the reader was supposed to assume the vampire in question is Remilia.&lt;ref name="PMiSSRemilia"&gt;[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]: [[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Remilia Scarlet|Remilia Scarlet]]&lt;/ref&gt; 
Later on, it was finally confirmed in [[Strange Creators of Outer World]] 2 that Remilia was indeed that vampire in the Vampire Incident.

==Character Design==
[[File:PMiSS remilia.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Remilia in ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]''.]]
===Name===
Her full name is {{nihongo|''Remilia Scarlet''|レミリア・スカーレット}} which, unlike most ''[[Touhou Project]]'' [[characters]], gives a strong western feeling, likely French or British. The name "Remilia" is likely made-up by [[ZUN]] as a variant of "Emilia", which means "Rival; Emulating". "Scarlet" refers to a bright shade of the color red with a slight hint of orange and is a variant of "Scarlett" as a surname. The middle dot ({{lang|ja|・}}) in the middle of her name is used in foreign names to show where the next word begins.

Despite having a name, she is more commonly known as "the vampire", {{nihongo|"the Scarlet Devil"|紅い悪魔}} and sometimes "the mistress". It's actually quite uncommon for other residents of Gensokyo to refer to her proper name. However, Patchouli calls her {{nihongo||レミィ|Remi}}.

===Design===
In ''[[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]]'', ''[[Immaterial and Missing Power]]'' and ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]'''s official art, Remilia has red eyes, short light-blue hair and a light-pink [[wikipedia:Mob cap|mob cap]] with a red ribbon decorated with white stripes. She wears a light-pink dress with a red ribbon on both sleeves (is seen with red trimmings in ''Embodiment of Scarlet Devil''), a large red ribbon behind her waist with white stripes and a necklace featuring a [[wikipedia:Caduceus|Caduceus-like]] centerpiece. She also has a pair of large black bat-like wings on her back with a wingspan wider than her height. In ''[[Imperishable Night]]'', she is seen without the necklace.

She is said to be about as tall as a girl in her early teens (10 to 14 years old).&lt;ref&gt;[[ZUN's E-mails]]&lt;/ref&gt;

; Alternative Outfits
Her alternate outfit in a palette from ''[[Immaterial and Missing Power]]'' and ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]'' has her dress red instead of pink and her hair blond. This color scheme looks similar to her sister's, [[Flandre Scarlet]].

}}
In ''[[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]]'', Remilia decided to release a mist over [[Gensokyo]] to block out the sun and let her move freely during the day; after her scheme was discovered and halted, she was forced to use a parasol to shade herself when she wanted to move around during daylight hours (as mentioned in ''[[Immaterial and Missing Power]]''). A speculation from [[Hieda no Akyuu]], however, is that Remilia actually staged the entire incident and lost on purpose in order to show [[Sakuya Izayoi]], who was having trouble adapting to Gensokyo's environment (possibly culture, given the context), that [[human]]s could be friends. There is nothing to prove this to be true, but nothing to really disprove it, either. 
:{{Main|Embodiment of Scarlet Devil/Story/Reimu's Scenario|l1=Reimu Arc|Embodiment of Scarlet Devil/Story/Marisa's Scenario|l2=Marisa Arc}}
Remilia does take her loss with amazing stride in every single ending, where the only hint of anger she shows about losing was jokingly ribbing [[Marisa Kirisame]] that things would have been cooler with the mist, though in the Marisa B ending Sakuya does hide Marisa in the library so Remilia can't find her. In the Reimu A ending, Remilia comes to the shrine with a parasol of her own volition and doesn't seem annoyed at having to use a parasol, causing Reimu to ask why she bothered with the mist in the first place. Unfortunately, Reimu starts playfully(?) grappling Remilia before Remilia can answer.

;''Imperishable Night''

[[File:Th08RemiliaSprite.png|frame|Remilia's sprite in ''IN'']]
:{{Main|Imperishable Night/Story/Scarlet Team's Scenario 1|l1=Imperishable Night Scarlet Team's Scenario}}
In ''[[Imperishable Night]]'' she heads out with Sakuya to punish the ones who took the full [[moon]] from the night sky since the fighting would be at night. Due to her weakness to sunlight, it's only possible to play as her on night [[stage]]s.

===Spin-offs===
;''Immaterial and Missing Power''
:{{Main|Immaterial and Missing Power/Story#Remilia's Story|l1=Immaterial and Missing Power Remilia's Scenario}}
During her story mode, Remilia leaves the [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]] after convincing Sakuya that she should handle it herself. After running into [[Marisa Kirisame]] and beating her up, she claims that she will be the "star" of the upcoming feast. She goes to the [[Hakurei Shrine]] afterwards and defeats Reimu, repeating her intentions. She then defeats both [[Youmu Konpaku]] and [[Yuyuko Saigyouji]]. Finally she meets [[Yukari Yakumo]], and demands to know who is behind the feasts happening every night. In the end [[Suika Ibuki]] appears and the [[vampire]] defeats her as well. During her ending, she tries to enjoy a full moon with Sakuya and they discuss what it means to have class.

In ''[[Shoot the Bullet]]'', [[Aya Shameimaru]] encountered Remilia on [[stage]] 7 and took photos of her [[danmaku]].

;''Scarlet Weather Rhapsody''
:{{Main|Scarlet Weather Rhapsody/Story#Remilia's Story|l1=Scarlet Weather Rhapsody Remilia's Scenario}}
In ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]'', she settles her "own" investigation by ordering [[Sakuya Izayoi]] to drag the suspects to her, in order to find the culprit, figuring later that the [[Tenshi Hinanawi|culprit]] is above the mountains, where she is very prone to the light.

;''Touhou Hisoutensoku''
:{{Main|Touhou Hisoutensoku/Translation/Remilia's Script|l1=Touhou Hisoutensoku Story}}
If connecting ''SWR'' with ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]'', then Remilia can become a selectable character to play with, although she appears in no scenarios. If the player places a custom parasol system card in Remilia's deck, she'll be able to fight in [[stage]]s that has sunlight, although she isn't shown with a parasol on-screen.

;''Hopeless Masquerade''
[[File:Th135Remilia.png|frame|Remilia in ''HM'']]
Remilia appears as a background cameo in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'' on the [[Hakurei Shrine]] [[stage]]. She is sitting on a chair with [[Patchouli Knowledge]] and [[Sakuya Izayoi]] drinking some tea. She has a [[Fairy Maid]] hovering above her holding a parasol to block the sunlight.

;''Impossible Spell Card''
:{{Main|Impossible Spell Card#Story|l1=Impossible Spell Card: Story}}
After apparently reading the newspaper by the [[tengu]] about a mischief-making [[amanojaku]], she becomes one of the many strong [[youkai]] and [[human]]s to try and stop [[Seija Kijin]] on the final day. She uses [[spell card]]s that are considered impossible to dodge.

===Literature===
;''[[Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red]]''
:{{Main|Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red/Remilia}}
Aya Shameimaru writes an article about the scarlet mist that Remilia used to cause the Scarlet Mist Incident, describing the weird red rainbow it creates and it's wing-like pattern (more specifically, angel wings, that would clash with Remilia's position as a [[Devil]]). However, when interviewed,  Remilia only explains the cause of the rainbow, saying that she doesn't know anything about the pattern and thus it had no real meaning. [[Patchouli Knowledge]] intervenes and after giving a more complete explanation about the scarlet rainbow, explains that the pattern is only a coincidence and it happened because Remilia releases the mist from her fingers, making it following the shape of the fingers themselves.

:{{Main|Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red/Flandre}}
Aya interviews Remilia, along with her sister, to get some informations about the meteorite that exploded in the sky. While Flandre just describes how she destroyed the thing, Remilia explains that the meteorite was ''fated'' to fall on her mansion right in the moment it happened, and that Flandre was also fated to be there destroying it. In a successive interview, Remilia re-explains that it not only was fated to fall there, but also that the event was caused artificially and that ''someone'' forced it to do so, showing a fragment of the meteorite covered by magical runes.

;''[[Silent Sinner in Blue]]''
With the help of Patchouli, Remilia is able to travel to the [[Moon]] together with Reimu, Sakuya and Marisa, using the [[Moon Rocket]] that uses Reimu's power. There they meet [[Watatsuki no Yorihime]] with various [[Moon rabbit]]s and pick a fight with them, but since both sides don't want to create a bloodshed, they fight using the [[spell card]] rules. After Yorihime defeats all of them, Remilia and the others (except Reimu) return to Earth. Despite suffering a crushing defeat from the Moon Princess, Remilia doesn't seem to be really bothered by it, and finds another way to pass time and amuse herself by building a fake indoor sea in the [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]].

;''[[Forbidden Scrollery]]''
In Chapter 6 of ''Forbidden Scrollery'', Remilia tells Reimu that she has found a rare animal from the outside world, a tupai, and is currently raising it. However, it goes missing, and it's assumed that it's behind the sake disappearances in the [[Human Village]]. In Chapter 7 this "tupai" is revealed to be [[Tupai|a chupacabra named Tupai]].

==Relationships==
===Residents of the Scarlet Devil Mansion===
;Flandre Scarlet
[[File:053BAiJRFlandre.jpg|thumb|192px|Remilia and Flandre, as illustrated in ''[[Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red]]''.]]
[[Flandre Scarlet]] is Remilia's younger sister. Flandre is stated to respect her sister, and Remilia cares for Flandre as shown where she is considering getting her a good tutor in ''[[Imperishable Night]]'', but it is unknown how often the two interact. ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'' states that it's rare (but not nonexistent) to see Flandre and Remilia together. However, they are seen depicted together many times such as in ''[[Forbidden Scrollery]]'' chapter 7 when they were looking at their pet [[Minor Characters#Tupai|Tupai]] and in ''[[Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red]]'', which also shows that Remilia will at least allow [[Aya Shameimaru]] to interview Flandre in the first place. They also show up together in ''[[The Grimoire of Usami]]'', ''[[Violet Detector]]'', and ''[[Foul Detective Satori]]''. The interview shows that although Flandre might respect her older sister, it's to the extent you'd expect a snarky child to. She is willing to outright state when she thinks Remilia is just spouting nonsense, at which point Remilia comes in with a comment that she shouldn't be talking about her older sister like that.

;Sakuya Izayoi
[[Sakuya Izayoi]] serves Remilia Scarlet as the Head [[Maid]] without question, a servitude with which no one knows why either trusts each other so much (''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Sakuya Izayoi|Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'' gives the most popular theory). She is often assigned to run errands relating to the current incidents, as Remilia cannot go outside without an umbrella. Sakuya follows Remilia's requests even when she knows it won't work, such as catching [[Lily White]] to catch Spring in ''[[Strange and Bright Nature Deity]]'', because that's what her mistress wants. When Remilia playfully criticizes Sakuya for her failure to catch spring, she takes it in good stride and doesn't disagree. They are shown to be close friends, as Remilia forgives Sakuya even though she is not always competent in keeping away unwanted visitors, seen through her defeat by two humans in [[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]]. She will also do things for Remilia if Remilia doesn't even ask, like accompanying her in ''[[Imperishable Night]]'' and ''[[Immaterial and Missing Power]]''. As stated in her profile, occasionally she's more a babysitter than a maid. She chastises Remilia in her ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]'' and ''[[Immaterial and Missing Power]]'' victory quotes for sneaking out food or playing around too much.

;Patchouli Knowledge
[[Patchouli Knowledge]] is Remilia's friend. In ''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]'' ending, Remilia called Patchouli {{nihongo||パチェ|Pache}}. The two have been depicted having tea and casual conversation together in ''[[Silent Sinner in Blue]]'', ''[[Oriental Sacred Place]]'' and ''[[Strange and Bright Nature Deity]]'', where Patchouli offhandedly commented that they're both creatures of the night. As stated in ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'', Patchouli's role at the mansion is to solve problems (and to cause them), although it is uncertain if that means she's officially an employee or not. Regardless, Patchouli will often volunteer her services when she sees Remilia in need of them (such as causing a rainstorm to keep [[Flandre Scarlet]] confined to the [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]] when Flandre was trying to get out in ''[[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]]''). It is unknown how Patchouli came to live at the Scarlet Devil Mansion, but she has been there for about one hundred years.

;Hong Meiling
[[Hong Meiling]] guards the gate of the [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]], and is thus an employee of Remilia's. Meiling serves her mistress faithfully and loyally (but not necessarily competently all the time), apologizing to her not-present mistress when she fails to defeat [[Reimu Hakurei]] or [[Marisa Kirisame]] in ''[[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]]''. The only known depiction of an actual interaction between Meiling and Remilia in an official work is their win quotes to each other in ''[[Immaterial and Missing Power]]'' as well as ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]'', which depicts their interactions as a generally friendly one. Other interactions are stated in other works, however. ''[[Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red]]'' shows that Remilia likes to play pranks on Meiling quite often (the latest in the article being an order for Meiling to restore the garden to normal despite how Remilia knew it was beyond Meiling's ability to do so). ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'' also mentions that Remilia enjoys watching Meiling's duels with challengers at the gate. It is unknown how Meiling came to be under Remilia's employ or who hired her (an advertisement in ''Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red'' shows that [[Sakuya Izayoi]] is the one currently in charge of hiring at the [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]], but that doesn't mean she was the one that hired Meiling).

;Other servants
[[File:FSch7-SDMChars.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Remilia mesmerising the Tupai with Flandre ''[[Forbidden Scrollery]]'' Chapter 7.]]
Similar to Meiling, the [[Fairy Maid]]s must put up with Remilia's outrageous requests from time to time, as stated in ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'', and Remilia gets frustrated with her fairies in ''[[Silent Sinner in Blue]]'' when they turn out to be quite useless during their battle against [[Watatsuki no Yorihime]] and her [[rabbit]]s. Punishments, however, are never mentioned or depicted, with Remilia only going so far as to make an angry comment on the subject. Presumably, Remilia knows how to manage her employees' needs well, as in ''[[Strange and Bright Nature Deity]]'' Chapter 1, Remilia tells [[Sakuya Izayoi]] to let the maids relax, because if they get worked too hard, they'll get mental health issues. This chapter shows the maids conversing in an official work, where they're worried about an upcoming soy bean festival because those tend to put the mistress in a bad mood (and are difficult to clean up). ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'' states that employees of the [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]] are allowed to leave their jobs at any time, yet most end up staying. This also could imply that the employees of the Scarlet Devil Mansion are not bound by a devil's contract (not including Sakuya).

Following the events of ''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'' chapter 16, Remilia employs a number of [[hobgoblin]]s as servants.

[[Koakuma]] is a devil seen in the library of the [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]] during ''[[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]]''. The relationship between her and Remilia is unknown, her official profile says that she lives in the Scarlet Devil Mansion so it could be said that she is technically under the employment of Remilia indirectly.

;[[Tupai]]
Tupai is Remilia's pet chupacabra. It is implied that she somehow mistook it for an actual [[wikipedia:treeshrew|tupai]], but still called it the "Tupai" anyway.

===Reimu Hakurei===
Remilia was indirectly involved in the discussions with [[Reimu Hakurei]] that led to the creation of the [[spell card]]rules. Certainly, ''[[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]]'' was where Reimu first met the other residents of the [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]], and also where she discovered that Remilia was the mistress. Reimu's actual dialogue with Remilia herself, however, does not necessarily indicate whether they knew each other prior to that meeting or not. At any rate, after their battle in ''Embodiment of Scarlet Devil'', Remilia often drops by the [[Hakurei Shrine]] to hang out with Reimu. She is one of several [[youkai]] depicted when Reimu complains about youkai hanging around her shrine in ''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'', and Reimu successfully argues in an early chapter of ''[[Strange and Bright Nature Deity]]'' that she should be allowed into a party at the Scarlet Devil Mansion because Remilia always comes to her shrine. Although Remilia is fond of Reimu, she still has a rivalry of sorts with the [[Shrine Maiden]] too and is more than happy to get into a duel with her, as shown in ''[[Imperishable Night]]'' and Remilia's storyline in ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]''.

===Aya Shameimaru===
Like most characters, Remilia has been interviewed by [[Aya Shameimaru]] and is an involuntary source of news for her. Unlike other characters, however, Remilia seems to actually enjoy Aya's visits. Remilia plays along with Aya in ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]'' pretending to be a monster in the [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]], and afterwards requests that Aya tell her if or when it gets in the news. She asks if she could be allowed to write an editorial for Aya's newspaper in her victory quote to Aya. Aya remarks to [[Hong Meiling]] in her ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]'' quote that she has a lot to thank the Scarlet Devil Mansion for due to its mass subscriptions to her news paper and providing lots of scoops. Remilia still gets annoyed when Aya just assumes she can come into the Scarlet Devil Mansion without being invited at the end of ''[[Silent Sinner in Blue]]'', but lets her come along anyways.

===Yukari Yakumo===
[[Yukari Yakumo]] used Remilia as part of her scheme to extract the residence tax and get revenge on the [[Lunarian]]s in ''[[Silent Sinner in Blue]]''. Patchouli reveals Remilia knew she was manipulated but didn't care, because she was bored. Remilia herself has an unexplained rivalry of sorts with Yukari, wanting to get to the [[Moon]] in her own way before Yukari could to surprise her. This rivalry might be due to the power struggle mentioned in [[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Vampire|''Perfect Memento in Strict Sense''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Vampire article]], possibly starting with the Vampire Incident. The rivalry is mostly on Remilia's part, though Remilia has no objections to Yukari staying for the party at the end of ''Silent Sinner in Blue'' or assisting her with investigating in ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]''.

Dialogue in ''[[Immaterial and Missing Power]]'' seems to imply they've already known each other before that game. It is possible they met at the Vampire Incident, and that Yukari was the one that signed "the contract" with Remilia.

==Additional Information==
*Due to "The Young Descendant of Tepes", the title of the prelude theme to the final [[boss]] [[stage]] of ''[[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]]'', she has been sometimes linked to Count Dracula's lineage. This is because Dracula's full name is [[wikipedia:Vlad the Impaler|Vlad Ţepeş Dracul]]. While Remilia herself asserts that she is a literal descendant of Ţepeş, [[ZUN]] claims that she is lying.
*Remilia is not only [[Sakuya Izayoi]]'s master but the one who gave Sakuya her name, according to ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]''. Considering Sakuya's murky past and the unlikelihood of a human becoming a vampire's servant, the leading theory is that Sakuya was once a vampire hunter, and Remilia earned Sakuya's servitude by besting her in combat.
*Based on her being around 500 years old during the events of EoSD, Remilia was probably born sometime in the late 15th century.
*The name of her spell card "Red Magic" is very likely a reference to a [[wikipedia:Hiroshi Mori (writer)|MORI Hiroshi]] novel {{nihongo|"All become F"|すべてがFになる|Subete ga F ni naru ~The Perfect Insider}}. In the novel, Redmagic is a name of an advanced [[wikipedia:OS|OS]] developed by the genius Shiki Magata.
*One of Remilia's spell card is named after [[Wikipedia:Gungnir|Gungnir]], the spear of Odin described as having the ability to always hit its mark.
*It is quite coincidental that Remilia's appearance was in the 6th game of the ''[[Touhou Project]]''. She is the Stage 6 boss, and the player will fight through 6 [[Spell Card|spell cards]] on that stage on any playable difficulty above Easy (Remilia has 5 spell cards total and Sakuya has 1 in her midboss appearance). When these numbers are all put together, it reads "666", which is often associated with the Devil in pop culture.
*Remilia's theme starts the same as [[wikipedia:Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s Piano Sonata no.8 Pathetique, "3rd Movement".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8W69EyxEjk a video of Beethoven's Piano Sonata no.8, Pathetique, 3rd Movement on YouTube]&lt;/ref&gt;
*In [[Curiosities of Lotus Asia/Chapter 04|''Curiosities of Lotus Asia'' Chapter 4]], [[Reimu Hakurei]] comments that Remilia should go back to her coffin. Remilia retorts that coffins are for the dead, indicating that she doesn't sleep in a coffin. In [[Imperishable Night/Translation/Scarlet Team's Scenario 1|''Imperishable Night''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Scarlet Team Scenario]], before battling Reimu, Remilia once again reminds her that she doesn't sleep in a coffin. Finally, in ''[[Oriental Sacred Place]]'' Chapter 15, released 7 years later, what's apparently the first canonical depiction of Remilia's bedroom is shown, and that she sleeps in a coffin (on a bed).
*Her first 5 alternate pallets in ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]'' resemble [[Flandre Scarlet]], [[Patchouli Knowledge]], [[Hong Meiling]], [[Sakuya Izayoi]] and [[Koakuma]], respectively.
*Despite her childish-girly appearance, she uses both a haughty "mistress" {{lang|ja|(～かしら？、～だわ)}} and a strong manly {{lang|ja|（～か？、～だ）}} speech patterns in her original Japanese lines. Unfortunately most of these nuances cannot be translated into English.
*There is a character from Yume 2kki named Oni Musume that bears a resemblance to her in terms of appearance (with the exception of pigtails or some sort of hair accessories in her hair) but is more close to [[Patchouli Knowledge]] in terms of location and behaviour.
*Since Remilia is a corruption of the name Emilia, a rather common name in France, and Scarlet is an alternative spelling to Scarlett, a common French surname, it's possible (but not certain) that Remilia is from France. Her sister's name, Flandre, is further evidence; Flandre is a French term for people from the province of Flanders, a region that, while today is in southern Belgium, was historically a part of France.
*Shibata Masahiro's manga series "[https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/manga.php?id=1648 Sarai]" seems to be a big inspiration for many of the characters from EoSD . Sarai is a manga about superpowered maids fighting youkai and monsters in a dystopian future. The series was published from 1997 to 2007 in Japan only.
** In Sarai there are [https://onsen.touhouwiki.net/wiki/File:Two_maids_with_mob_cap.jpeg two small maid girls with red hair and wear mob caps]. This is likely what inspired Remilia and [[Flandre]].

Ability: Manipulation of fate

The final boss. She's been the mistress for about 500 years.

She doesn't tell you directly and only hint during the game, but she is a [[vampire]]. She blanketed [[Gensokyo]] with a magic mist in order to cut off the sunlight. Although she has been alive for 500 years, her personality is that of a selfish child. 

She is respected by most [[youkai]], but her charisma doesn't stem from her personality; rather, it comes from the fear that they have for her kind. She has one younger sister; nothing else is known about her family.

She is a light eater. In other words, she can drink only a little blood at a time and must leave the rest behind, so the [[human]]s off of whom she feeds become a bit anemic, but usually stay alive. Due to that fact, she always fails to increase the number of her kind.&lt;br /&gt;
She often spills more blood than she consumes. The spilled blood dyes her dress a deep scarlet, which is what gives rise to her title, the "Scarlet Devil".

She swears that she is a descendant of Tepes, but nobody is certain whether she is truly related to ''the'' Vlad "Dracula" Tepes.&lt;br /&gt;
Well, in fact, she is not.

Total of ten card attacks.

Remilia Scarlet&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Species: [[Vampire]]&lt;br /&gt;
Location: [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]]&lt;br /&gt;
Abilities: Manipulation of fate&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Master of the Scarlet Devil Mansion. She looks young, but she's actually a vampire who's over 500 years old. Weak against sunlight, she has to take a parasol if she wants to go out in the daytime.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Her personality is somewhat childish, and she's got maids who are basically at her beck and call,
so she can be as egotistical as she wants. She's immensely powerful, so she can really kick up a fuss.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Faster than the eye can follow, strong enough to crush boulders, powerful enough to manipulate demons, she's so strong it's almost not fair, so she doesn't care much for subtle technique. She may be weak against sunlight, but she has a pretty strong constitution, so as long as some bit of her still remains, say, a little bat, she can regenerate any time. She's dreadful to have as an enemy, but she's not exactly the sort of person you'd want as a friend, either.

| translation = '''The Scarlet Devil, Remilia Scarlet'''

A [[vampire]] who resides in the [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]].
She can manipulate fate. She has apparently lived for over 500 years.
Considering how long she has lived, she acts rather childishly.

Creatures of her kind forfeit their growth and maturity in exchange for eternal life.
In other words, she can live forever because she never grows up.

It goes without saying that she is weak against sunlight, can't cross flowing water, hates garlic, and despises sardine heads. Crosses have no effect on her.
It puzzles her to hear that her kind are supposed to be weak against such a thing.

She uses bats and arrows as her weapons. She can spawn an unlimited number of bats from herself.
:''Notes''
:*She teams up with [[Sakuya Izayoi|Sakuya]] this time.
:*Normal speed only applies when she's used as a solo character.
:*Her familiar remains in place once set, and continues to attack from that position.
:*Used properly, it's quite effective against both bosses and their weakling subordinates.
:*Good for those who believe that memorization of the enemies' appearance position is the basis of [[shooting game]]s.

On the shore of a lake in [[Gensokyo]], there is a scarlet mansion.&lt;br /&gt;
She is the mistress of that mansion.

She is very childish even though she has been alive for more than 500 years.
Devils, including vampires, are hated with a passion by both [[human]]s and [[youkai]], because their kind tend to be self-centered and selfish.
Remilia indeed is no exception. Type-B blood tastes the most delicious to her.

&lt;br/&gt;

Master of the "[[Scarlet Devil Mansion]]", a European-style building located by the shore of a [[Misty Lake|lake]]. She looks like a young girl, but in fact she's a vampire who has lived more than 500 years. Her personality and behavior are as childlike as her appearance, though.
She takes pride in her tremendous physical abilities as a [[vampire]], and additionally she has the ability to manipulate fate. It appears that any person nearby her will have an unfortunate fate, even if Remilia herself is unaware of them.

と思って作り始めましたが、よくよく考えたら、超人的な身体能力や吸血といった能力はRPG向けでしたね。弾幕を作るには苦労しました。&lt;br/&gt;
格好いいキャラは人間の咲夜に任せて、わがままなお嬢様方面に振りました。ただそれだけだと人間と区別が付かないので、大きな蝙蝠の羽を付けました。でもこれ、どちらかというとバ○ムートですね(笑)

That's what I thought when I started making the game. Now I think of it, that superhuman toughness and vampiric ability are only suited for roleplaying games. Making bullet patterns for vampires ended up very difficult.&lt;br/&gt;
I assigned the badass role to Sakuya, the human character, then let Remilia take the role of a selfish noble princess. I soon realized that this has made Remilia no different than an average human, so I gave her a huge pair of bat wings to compensate. But the more I looked at it the more it felt like Bahamut from Final Fantasy (lol)

{{nihongo|'''Renko Usami'''|宇佐見 蓮子|Usami Renko}} is a student in the [[outside world]], presumably in a college or university. She majors in physics and is very objective and logical in her approach to matters. Together with her friend, [[Maribel Hearn]], she has an interest in what would be considered the paranormal. Their club, consisting of only the two of them, describes itself as a club for necromancers. However they don't do many of the things necromancers would normally be associated with. Instead, they investigate spirits and such. Specifically they're interested in [[Gensokyo]] and seem to be among the few, or even the only, [[human]]s in the outside world who know of Gensokyo's existence.

==General Information==
===Occupation===
According to ''[[Changeability of Strange Dream]]'', she studies super-unified physics, specializing in "strings." According to ''[[Retrospective 53 minutes]]'', she lives in [[Kyoto]] like Maribel does, but her actual home seems to be in Tokyo.

==Character Design==
===Name===
Her full name is {{nihongo|''Renko Usami''|宇佐見 蓮子}}, where both the given name and surname are actual names in Japanese. The kanji for {{nihongo||蓮子|Renko}} literally mean "lotus child" respectively; the ''-ko'' is a common suffix in Japanese that's used in female names.

===Design===
Renko usually wears a black hat with a bow, white suit, and a brown dress. In [[Magical Astronomy]] and [[Trojan Green Asteroid]], she is also wearing a black shawl. She also has brown hair and often carries a book with her.

==Appearances==

;''Ghostly Field Club''
:{{Main|Ghostly Field Club/Story|l1=Ghostly Field Club Story}}
Using a photograph of the [[Netherworld]] and Renko's ability to determine location from the [[Moon]], Merry and Renko attempt to find the entrance to the Netherworld in a ghostly field.

;''Changeability of Strange Dream''
:{{Main|Changeability of Strange Dream/Story|l1=Changeability of Strange Dream Story}}
Merry is talking with Renko about how she is visiting [[Gensokyo|a strange world]] in her dreams.  It starts out nicely but begins to become nightmarish as Merry is attacked by youkai.  Merry has trouble figuring out what is reality and what is just a dream, and to further complicate the issue, she presents Renko with some of the items she had obtained in her dreams. Renko realizes the truth, and in the end must decide on which will be Merry's reality.

;''Retrospective 53 Minutes''
:{{Main|Retrospective_53_minutes/Story|l1=Retrospective 53 Minutes Story}}
In ''[[Retrospective 53 minutes]]'', Merry and Renko were on a train to Tokyo. They were looking at a simulated kaleido screen of the outside and discussing the trip, the view, and the nature of objectivity and subjectivity related to it. Renko commented on her, saying "You might be as carefree as the Tōhoku people though". The trip lasts 53 minutes.

;''Magical Astronomy''
:{{Main|Magical Astronomy/Story|l1=Magical Astronomy Story}}
The university campus is abuzz with news of public tours to the moon. Merry and Renko talk about the world on the moon hidden from humans and eagerly try to plan their own trip to there.  Merry gets a special idea.

;''Trojan Green Asteroid''
:{{Main|Trojan Green Asteroid/Story|l1=Trojan Green Asteroid Story}}
Maribel and Renko discuss the lost micro-habitat space station [[TORIFUNE]], Merry claiming that she has seen inside it and everything is still alive. Since the station contains a shrine to Ame-no-Torifune, they travel to another such shrine and use Maribel's ability to transport themselves there through their dreams. They discover that the interior has become a dense jungle, and are attacked by a [[chimera]]. Maribel wakes up with a cut on her arm and is sent to hospital.

;''Neo-traditionalism of Japan''
:{{Main|Neo-traditionalism of Japan/Story|l1=Neo-traditionalism of Japan Story}}
While in hospital, Maribel is diagnosed with sleepwalking and hallucinations; believing this to be a previously unknown virus, the doctors send her to the mountains for isolation treatment. By the time she's released her powers have grown stronger and she now sees visions while awake. Merry discusses Hell with Renko, but doesn't tell her that she physically travelled to Hell while in isolation. Renko tells Merry that while she was in isolation the news has been talking about discoveries of stone tools more than 25 million years old, though they were dismissed as a hoax.[[File:ThGKPartII.png|thumb|210px|Maribel and Renko's cameo in ''[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]]'']] Merry believes otherwise, and presents one she found herself. Merry shows Renko a vision of the underground realm where she found it, and Renko recognises the Ame-no-Sakahoko as being there. Merry calms down, no longer believing the place she saw to be Hell but the world of the gods. The two decide to find more such "Izanagi Objects" that lie unrecognised across Japan.

;''Dr. Latency's Freak Report''
:{{Main|Dr. Latency's Freak Report/Story|l1=Dr. Latency's Freak Report Story}}
At Maribel's suggestion, the duo is planning on self-publishing a book, in which they would relate the stories of the mysterious worlds they had seen. Under the pen name of "Dr. Latency", Maribel is dictating to Renko her parts of the book, including a summary of the strange places she saw as well as her theories in her attempt to rationalize what was defying the common sense of the world.

;''Dateless Bar "Old Adam"''
:{{Main|Dateless Bar "Old Adam"/Story|l1=Dateless Bar "Old Adam" Story}}
Renko invites Maribel to the "Old Adam" bar, a special place where old-style alcohol is being served and said to be a gathering spot for those who can see illusions. Almost everyone there seems to have read the ''Swallowstone Naturalis Historia'', the self-published fanzine Maribel and Renko made before, and believe its content entirely. The duo came here to hear the stories of the locals, hoping to find valuable information or even people that may have special abilities like them.

==Relationships==
===Maribel Hearn===
Renko and [[Maribel Hearn]] are the only members of the [[Hifuu Club]] and both are fellow students at a university. The two are very good friends, working together to seek out other worlds, travelling by train together to Renko's home-town, discussing going to the [[moon]] together, and Maribel confiding to Renko about her travels to another world in her dreams.

===Sumireko Usami===
Because [[Sumireko Usami]] shares Renko's surname, has a similar appearance, and as she created the [[Hifuu Club]] that Renko is part of, there is likely some sort of relation between the two. However, the specifics of this connection is as yet unknown. Sumireko's profile suggests Renko descends from the former.

==Additional Information==
*Regardless of the place she is at, with her ability to tell the time by looking only at the stars, she can only tell the current time in Japanese Standard Time (JST). If she wanted to know the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), she would have to do the necessary calculation.
*Regardless of the presence of absence of scenery in a photograph, in ''[[Ghostly Field Club]]'' she was able to tell where a photograph was taken due to the projection of the moon in the photograph.
*In both ''[[Ghostly Field Club]]'' and ''[[Changeability of Strange Dream]]'', she was the one who was late for the meeting with Merry.
*Renko is one of the only characters known to live [[Outside World|outside of Gensokyo]]. As such, she has never actually met any of the other characters except Maribel Hearn, who also lives outside Gensokyo. [[Yuyuko Saigyouji]] has encountered the Secret Sealing Club on a visit to the outside world, but Renko did not seem able to see her.

{{nihongo|'''Rika'''|里香}} is a tank [[engineer]] that appears on [[Stage]] 1 and the Extra Stage of ''[[Story of Eastern Wonderland]]'', being the [[boss]] of those stages, where she creates a large number of monsters and starts hanging around the [[Hakurei Shrine]] while [[Reimu Hakurei]] is away. The reason for and method of creating all of these monsters and [[bakebake]] isn't clear at all.

==General Information==
Rika is known to have create machines that she herself created, including a few [[cannon]]s, the [[Shrine Tank]], the [[Flower-Tank]] and the flying tank [[Evil Eye Σ]]. Since Rika is an [[engineer]], she ought to have excelled in mathematics, science and even engineering in order to create her tanks. However, on how she's able to do all this herself using [[Gensokyo]]'s technology is unknown. In her speech patterns, she's shown to use the auxiliary {{nihongo|"It's assuredly that—"|～なのです|~nanodesu}}.

==Character Design==
===Name===
Her name is {{nihongo|''Rika''|里香}}. The [[wikipedia:Kanji|kanji]] in her name can mean "village incense". With different kanji, "Rika" can also refer to "science" in Japanese. There's a possiblity that her name may've also been based on [[Wikipedia:ja:香山リカ (精神科医)|Rika Kayama]], who is a psychiatrist.

===Design===
In ''[[Story of Eastern Wonderland]]'''s official art, Rika has brown eyes, long brown hair in two braids, wears a white shirt with a purple bow beneath its collar and she holds a piece of chalk in her left hand. Her vague sprite shows that she has black hair, wears a grey shirt, a red cape, and what appears to be black trousers of some sort. In the Extra Stage, she has purple (brown?) eyes, long purple (brown?) hair in two braids, white horns and wears a strange red hat. She also wears a purple shirt with a red ribbon in front.

==Appearances==
[[File:Th02RikaSprite.png|frame|Vague sprite of Rika on Stage 1]]
;''Story of Eastern Wonderland''
:{{Main|Story of Eastern Wonderland/Story}}
During [[Stage]] 1 of ''[[Story of Eastern Wonderland]]'', [[Reimu Hakurei]] and [[Genji]] encounters Rika as a "suspicious character", who stated that everything on the stage was created by her, which includes the [[bakebake]], a few [[cannon]]s and the [[Shrine Tank]]. She then attacks Reimu with the [[Flower-Tank]] that she's created with no apparent reason, but is defeated quickly. Sobbing, she wanted Reimu to follow her into a trap, which Reimu refuses and heads on to another direction.

Later during the Extra Stage, Reimu once again encounters Rika, who reveals her name and that this is the "trap" she wanted Reimu to come to: to fight her flying tank [[Evil Eye Σ]]. They talk about that Reimu followed Rika during Stage 1, then Reimu's battle with the Evil Eye Σ would've been Stage 2, which is [[Canon#Fourth wall|breaking the fourth wall]]. After a long harsh battle, Rika is defeated and the Evil Eye Σ lets out a huge explosion for the player to dodge. This made Reimu wonder if she's truly the strongest, but [[Genji]] insisted it's thanks to the [[Yin-Yang Orb]]s.
 
==Additional Information==
*Rika was the first [[boss]] ever in a ''[[Touhou Project]]'' shooting game with the [[Flower-Tank]], as well as the first Extra Stage boss with the [[Evil Eye Σ]]. With this, she is also the first character ever to be a [[stage]] boss and an Extra boss in the same game, with [[Alice Margatroid]], [[Junko]] (only partially) and [[Okina Matara]] being the only other Touhou characters to do this.
*Rika said in ''[[Story of Eastern Wonderland]]'' that she created the [[Bakebake]] on the first stage of ''Story of Eastern Wonderland'', but it's unknown if the bakebake in other games (as well as the entire of ''Story of Eastern Wonderland'') were also created by her.
*Rika is the only character in the series to pilot a vehicle during a boss fight - tanks that she herself constructed. This also shows that she's the only character in the whole series to not fight in flesh without any abilities or magic whatsoever. This could therefore make her the ''weakest'' character in the gaming series, since she has no ability to fight herself.
*Rika, [[Fujiwara no Mokou]] and [[Marisa Kirisame]] are the only three Extra bosses in the series that are known to be completely human.

{{nihongo|'''Rikako Asakura'''|朝倉　理香子|Asakura Rikako}} is among the few people in [[Gensokyo]] who values science more than magic, though she can use both. Because of this, she's regarded as a heretic by [[Reimu Hakurei]]. Believing the ruins in ''[[Phantasmagoria of Dim.Dream]]'' were made by science, she ends up in the big battle to enter the [[Probability Space Hypervessel]].

==Character Design==
===Name===
{{nihongo|"''Rika''"|理香}} means Science in Japanese, and {{nihongo|"''ko''"|子}} is common at the end of female Japanese names. The fact that "''Rika''" means Science links to the fact that Rikako is a scientist. The surname {{nihongo|"Asakura"|朝倉}} is a common Japanese surname.

===Design===
Rikako appears to wear a white lab coat with a yellow ribbon at the collar, with a white ribbon in her hair and small round glasses. Her hair and eyes appear purple. Her alternate outfit is the same, except her lab coat and ribbon is a peach colour. Her hair and eyes also appear red.

==Appearances==
;''Phantasmagoria of Dim.Dream''
:{{Main|Phantasmagoria of Dim.Dream/Story#Rikako Asakura's Ending|l1=Phantasmagoria of Dim.Dream Story}}
In ''[[Phantasmagoria of Dim.Dream]]'', if Rikako successfully defeats [[Yumemi Okazaki]], her wish of having knowledge of the outside world's science comes true; she eventually becomes one of the most famous scientists in [[Gensokyo]].

==Additional Information==
*Rikako appears on the cover of ''[[Phantasmagoria of Dim.Dream]]'' along with all the other characters in that game.
*Rikako is the first {{nihongo|''girl with glasses''|眼鏡っ娘|meganekko}} in the series.
*Rikako has the longest boss theme in the series, with the music not looping until 4:57.
*Rikako's player sprite seems to indicate that she is a normal human and flies by using strap-on rockets. However, her profile indicates that, while she ''is'' able to use magic, she refrains from it out of personal dislike.
*[[Morgan]] (from the ''[[Seihou Project]]'') shares some similarities with Rikako.

There aren't a lot of people in this world that believe in science. Magic rules supreme.&lt;br/&gt;
Rikako is one of those rare believers in science in this world. She herself believes that there must be some power beyond magic.&lt;br/&gt;
However, she is also a magic user, and a fairly powerful one at that.&lt;br/&gt;
Setting aside science for a moment, when she gets serious with her magic power, nothing can stop her, but she doesn't really like magic so this doesn't happen often.

{{nihongo|'''Rin Kaenbyou'''|火焔猫 燐|Kaenbyou Rin}} is one of [[Satori Komeiji]]'s pets. Her job is to carry corpses to the former [[Hell of Blazing Fires]] to regulate its heat.

==General Information==
===Personality===
Rin has an energetic, positive personality; she prefers to be called Orin, since she doesn't like long names. She claims that while it is more fun to take on a pure [[cat]] form, she can't talk to [[human]]s that way - nor does it seem she can do her job, carting corpses away, which she seems to take great pleasure in. She appears to have challenged the main character in ''[[Subterranean Animism]]'' partly because she wanted their corpse, but also partly to test their strength to see if they would be able to stop [[Utsuho Reiuji]] for her, and appears to bear no ill will towards them for her defeat. ''[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]]'' states that she has no interest in killing humans herself to gain their corpses; she prefers to hunt for those on the verge of death, supposedly because it makes for more interesting conversation. If a corpse is properly buried, she'll lose interest.

===Abilities===
;Carrying away corpses
Rin's official profile lists her ability as "carrying away corpses". As an ability that comes from her species, it is as it sounds like. The carried-away corpses burn as fuel for the [[Hell of Blazing Fires]], although it is a mystery why the abandoned Hell of Blazing Fires needs to be fuelled in the first place. Incidentally, the spirits of the corpses carried away by [[kasha]] become [[onryou]] and become unable to achieve nirvana. She can also shift between cat form and human form at will. [[Hieda no Akyu]] states in ''[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]]'' that her corpse-carrying ability is not really a [[youkai]]-like one, but she is very good at it, using various tricks.

;Controlling and communicating with spirits
She is able to communicate with corpses and control all kinds of [[spirit]]s; she appears to enjoy the conversations of the freshly dead, because they may not realize they're dead. In combat, she can briefly reanimate corpses so that they "act" like zombies.

However, prior to the events of ''[[Subterranean Animism]]'', she displays the ability to drive [[vengeful spirit]]s above-ground, which is what causes the heroines to dive underground in the first place. ''[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]]'' does not mention this.

===Occupation===
Rin is a [[kasha]] living in the [[Palace of the Earth Spirits]]; her master is [[Satori Komeiji]]. Essentially, she lives day-to-day by stealing corpses from funerals to cart them to the former [[Hell of Blazing Fires]]. She will not kill humans herself, though she (quite efficiently) pursues humans that are close to death, hiding stolen corpses in her wheelbarrow using a straw mat, or just generally collecting corpses she happens to run across. Humans do not usually think that she would be carting corpses out in the open like she does, so she has a degree of freedom even in places with lots of people. In addition to maintaining the energy influx for the power source, she also controls vengeful spirits, at least in the vicinity.

===Possessions===
Rin's only possession is her wheelbarrow, often referred to as "Orin's Cat Cart". It has no special properties, but ''[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]]'' describes it as the pushcart that has likely carried the most corpses in all of history.

==Backstory==
When the [[Underground]] separated from [[Hell]], becoming known as [[Former Hell]], both Rin and [[Utsuho Reiuji]] became pets to [[Satori Komeiji]]. Her job is to cart corpses into the fires generating heat for the Underground. One day, she noticed that the flames were extremely strong - much stronger than usual - and, worried, forced evil spirits above-ground to try and signal [[youkai]] to come help. She did not tell Satori about the possibly gigantic power Utsuho had obtained, however, and decides to figure things out for herself.

==Character Design==
[[File:ThGKRin.png|thumb|220px|Rin's illustration in ''[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]]'']]
===Origin===
Rin's concept is taken from the [[kasha]], a type of [[youkai]] that appears during stormy weather to bring the bodies of sinners to Hell. They are said to be cats that have turned into youkai through various circumstances such as long life. Sometimes temples near places where kasha are said to live will hold two funerals for the dead: in the first, the coffin is filled with rocks so that the kasha won't disrupt the funeral to carry off the deceased. Rin is said to steal corpses from funerals while no one is looking.

===Name===
Her full name is {{nihongo|''Rin Kaenbyou''|火焔猫 燐|Kaenbyou Rin}}. The characters for {{nihongo||火焔猫|Kaenbyou}} literally mean "blazing cat". The one for {{nihongo||燐|Rin}} means "phosphorus". Rin is shown pushing a wheelbarrow, which is also known in Japanese as a {{nihongo||猫車|Nekoguruma}}, which means "cat cart".

===Design===
Rin has black cat ears and dark red eyes, with fiery red hair styled into twin braids and adorned by black ribbons at the top and bottom of the braids. She wears a black decorated dress with green frills. She's pushing a wheelbarrow in one hand and holding a vengeful spirit in the other. Surrounding her are several more of these spirits.

==Appearances==
===Games===
;Subterranean Animism
[[File:Th11OrinSprite.png|frame|Rin's sprite in ''SA'']]
[[File:Th11OrinCatSprite.png|frame|Rin's cat form sprite in ''SA'']]
Rin's story in ''[[Subterranean Animism]]'' is similar no matter what player character you pick. she appears as the [[stage]] 4, 5 and 6 midboss, while appearing as the [[boss]] for stage 5. When a human arrives underground instead of a youkai like she was expecting, she challenges the heroine, wanting to take her corpse. However, she is defeated, and upon witnessing the heroine's strength, asks her to go deeper into the Hell of Blazing Fires in order to stop [[Utsuho Reiuji]]. During her boss battle, she is seen summoning [[Zombie Fairy|Zombie Fairies]] and [[Vengeful spirit]]s.

===Spin-offs===
;Double Spoiler
In ''[[Double Spoiler]]'', Rin appeared as a [[stage]] 8 [[boss]] and uses [[spell card]]s that involves [[Zombie Fairy|Zombie Fairies]] when [[Aya Shameimaru]] and [[Hatate Himekaidou]] take photos of her and her [[danmaku]]. When taking a picture of Rin in her cat form, the player is awarded the "Cat bonus", which gives a bonus of [[Wikipedia:666 (number)|666]] points, the mark of the beast. This is somewhat fitting considering that Rin is located in [[Hell]].

;Hopeless Masquerade
[[File:Th135RinDancing.gif|frame|Anigif of Rin dancing in ''HM'']]
Rin appears as a background cameo in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'' on the [[Palace of Earth Spirits]] and [[Youkai Tanuki Forest]] stage. She is seen doing a rally cheer.
[[File:WaHHOrin.png|thumb|220px|Rin appearance in Wild and Horned Hermit]]

===Literature===
;[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]]
In her [[Symposium of Post-mysticism/Bunbunmaru Newspaper 2|article]] in the [[Bunbunmaru Newspaper]], Rin was brought in to the [[Myouren Temple]] by [[Byakuren Hijiri]] and the others to talk to the zombie guarding part of the cemetery, [[Yoshika Miyako]]. After explaining to them that the reanimated corpse doesn't want to hurt anyone, she takes a few other corpses as payment and returns to the Underground with them.

In addition, Byakuren mentions that Rin once came up from the [[Underworld]] because she wanted to join the temple. The monk turned her away as Rin really only wanted access to the vast amount of graves in the graveyard.

;Wild and Horned Hermit
{{stub|section}}

;[[Foul Detective Satori]]
In ''Foul Detective Satori'', she appears as [[Satori Komeiji]]'s assistant, acting as a kind of "[[Wikipedia:Dr._Watson|Dr. Watson]]" to Satori's "[[Wikipedia:Sherlock_Holmes|Sherlock Holmes]]".

==Relationships==
[[File:ThGK_Bunbunmaru2.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Rin with [[Yoshika Miyako]] in ''SoPm'']]
;[[Satori Komeiji]]
Satori is Rin and Utsuho's master. Apparently she keeps them as pets, but they have their own jobs to do, and are not seen together very often in the games or in books.

;[[Utsuho Reiuji]]
Utsuho is described as Rin's old friend from when the [[yama]] split Hell out of the Underground. She is on good enough terms with her to not tell Satori about the trouble she causes in ''[[Subterranean Animism]]''.

;[[Chen]]
In ''Foul Detective Satori'', Chen and Rin appear to be very friendly and physically affectionate with each other, implying an amiable relationship between the two.&lt;ref name="fds1"&gt;[[Foul Detective Satori]] - Chapter 8&lt;/ref&gt;

===Minor Relationships===
;[[Yoshika Miyako]]
In ''[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]]'', Rin is brought in to communicate with Yoshika, as her ability is being able to talk to corpses.

==Additional Information==
*Her name, Rin, shares pronunciation with {{nihongo|輪|"wheel"}}, which might be in reference to her motifs of wheels and carts, as well as her species as a [[kasha]].
*Rin may be one of the most persistent ''[[Touhou Project]]'' [[boss]]es, appearing as a midboss in three [[stage]]s, and as a stage boss all in one game.
*Some of her attacks resemble attacks used by the second boss of ''[[Samidare]]'' from ''[[Project Blank]]'', [[Anareta]].
*In ancient Aztec culture, each household had a small red dog called the Techichi who was said to guide lost souls to the underworld, and would often be sacrificed along with its master. Strangely, Rin has red hair and performs a similar duty.
*Rin's dancing pose in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'' may be a reference to how she dances in [[Twilight Frontier]]'s ''[[Komeiji Satori no Jousou Kyouiku]]'', where Rin, or [[Koishi Komeiji]], will do a similar dance if she manages to get to a gift-box first.

Rin Kaenbyou (nickname: Orin)

Species: kasha&lt;br/&gt;
Ability: Carrying away corpses

Her real name is Rin Kaenbyou.&lt;br/&gt;
She doesn't like long names, though, so she has everyone call her Orin.

A cat that lives among the flames, and Satori's pet. Since she's well-spoken and can converse freely with corpses and spirits, she was left in charge of controlling the spirits in what was once the Hell of Blazing Fires.

She has an old friend named Reiuji Utsuho. They've been close friends since before the time Satori began taking care of her, that is, the time when the underground separated from Hell.


One day, she felt a disturbance in what was left of the Hell of Blazing Fires.&lt;br/&gt;
The flames were much stronger than usual.

Regulating the flames was Utsuho's job. Orin went to visit Utsuho and was surprised by what she found.&lt;br/&gt;
She had discovered a frighteningly strong power, or had been given it by someone.

Since then, Utsuho began to grow stronger, and to seek out power.&lt;br/&gt;
Eventually, she started talking about conquering the above ground and turning it into a scorching hell.

There's no way she should have been able to do that. There's no way Satori would allow it.&lt;br/&gt;
If anybody underground found out about this plan, the oni would probably take care of Utsuho.&lt;br/&gt;
Amazed by the transformation her friend had undergone, Orin began to delve into a forbidden art.


That forbidden art was how to drive the vengeful spirits above ground. If she could force some sort of incident with the youkai above ground, something would surely change.&lt;br/&gt;
She was trying to get the youkai above ground to help her, but what finally appeared before her was a human from above ground.

That human was unexpectedly strong, and what is more, she specialized in youkai extermination.&lt;br/&gt;
If she's really that strong, Orin thought, she might be able to deal with Utsuho.


Everything would have turned out fine if Orin had just gone to Satori in the first place, but she thought it would be better if she tried to hide what Utsuho was doing. If Satori had found out about Utsuho's plan, she thought, she'd waste no time dealing with Utsuho in a ruthless fashion. Of course, that wasn't true, but just as children are afraid of their parents finding out their secrets, Orin was afraid of Satori finding out about hers. Orin was somewhat in awe of Satori.

{{nihongo|'''Rin Satsuki'''|冴月麟|Satsuki Rin}} would have been the third playable character of ''[[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]]'' but was cut during production due to time constraints.&lt;ref&gt;[[ZUN's AWA Q&amp;A Panel]]&lt;/ref&gt; A trace amount of data about her name was left in the game data. Not much is known about her, but the text "{{lang|ja|冴月 麟}}" (or the hex code "&lt;tt&gt;8D E1 8C 8E 20 97 D9&lt;/tt&gt;", Shift-JIS encoding) can be found in the "&lt;tt&gt;{{lang|ja|東方紅魔郷}}.exe&lt;/tt&gt;" executable file near [[Reimu Hakurei]] and [[Marisa Kirisame]]'s line of code.

==General Information==
There's traces of information scattered in relation to ''[[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]]'' that could be associated with her. In the games data, there are two attack types: {{nihongo|Flower Sign|花符}} and {{nihongo|Wind Sign|風符}}. An alleged portrait of her (or an otherwise unknown character) appears on [[Team Shanghai Alice]]'s circle cut in the Comiket when ''Embodiment of Scarlet Devil'' was first released (shown in the info box on the left). This was later revealed to be an unrelated poster girl for Team Shanghai Alice however. Additionally, shown in the data files by using a tool to rip graphics from the game, there is an unused character in the Stage 1 enemy sprites that looks much like the character in the portrait, although there's a possibility that this was originally going to be [[Rumia]].

===Occupation===
Based on a remark by [[Marisa Kirisame]] in her [[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil: Marisa's Extra|Extra Stage]] &lt;ref&gt;''Maybe I shoulda said "nurse"?'' - Marisa, Extra Stage&lt;/ref&gt;, Rin is theorized to be a nurse, but this is pure speculation. However, in modern Japanese popular culture, the kirin is often conflated with the unicorn (cf. ''Final Fantasy, Monster Hunter''), which has healing powers; this would suggest a connection between kirin and nurses.

==Character Design==
===Name===
Her name {{nihongo|Rin|麟}} stands for the mythological creature [[wikipedia:Qilin|Kirin]], prompting some to believe that she was supposed to be a personification of a kirin. This is supported by the fact that by the Japanese name order, her name is "Satsu'''ki Rin'''." Official pronunciation and romanization are unknown. Her name "{{lang|ja|冴月 麟}}" is generally pronounced {{nihongo|"Rin Satsuki"|さつき りん}}.

Other possibilities for reading her name includes {{lang|ja|冴}} as ''sae'' or ''kooru'' and {{lang|ja|月}} as ''getsu'' or ''gatsu''. "{{lang|ja|麟}}" has however only one reading: '''rin'''.

In the past it was thought that the girl in the [[Miscellaneous illustrations by ZUN#Circle Cut|circle cut]] was Rin Satsuki, however a Twitter post revealed the girl in the picture wasn't Rin Satsuki, and instead claimed it was a Team Shanghai Alice "poster girl".&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/cynthia_koko/status/500621570050490369&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/cynthia_koko/status/500651130821431297&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/cynthia_koko/status/500628811478614019&lt;/ref&gt;
The poster girl is wearing a large ribbon on her hair with cherry hair pins and a dress-like blouse. She holds an [[wikipedia:Erhu|erhu]] upside down and the colours are unknown because the circle cut is in monochrome.

{{nihongo|'''Ringo'''|鈴瑚|Ringo}} is a [[moon rabbit]] who appears as the [[stage]] 2 [[boss]] in ''[[Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom]]''.

==General Information==

===Personality===
Ringo is an individual who prefers to be alone and away from the public's attention. She can be friendly to people that interest her, even if they are enemies. After losing, she commends her opponent's strengths and tells them where to go. She expresses a desire to live on Earth. Since she liked Earth so much, Ringo decided to desert the Moon and stay in Gensokyo, where she owns a Dango stand these days. &lt;ref&gt; ''[[Alternative Facts in Eastern Utopia]]'' - [[Seiran]] and Ringo article &lt;/Ref&gt;

===Abilities===
;Growing in strength by eating Dango
Ringo seems to grow stronger by eating more Dango. The specifics of her abilities are unknown, however.

===Occupation===
She is a member of the ''"Eagle Ravi" Earth Recon Unit'', and along with [[Seiran|other members]], she was sent to "purify" the Earth. However, she takes no direct role in this as her job is more leisurely; she is in charge of Information Management, which is considered a high-ranking job in the Lunarian Military. Despite being highly ranked, she had no info on why the Lunar Capital was relocated to the Dream World, she assumes that she would've been dealt with had she found out. &lt;ref name="PR"&gt; ''[[Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom]]'' - Ringo's omake &lt;/ref&gt;

==Character Design==
===Name===
{{nihongo|''Ringo''|鈴瑚}} is spelled with the characters for {{nihongo|''rin''|鈴}} "bell, chime", and {{nihongo|''go''|瑚}} "[[Wikipedia:Coral|coral]]" a marine sessile animal, attractive for it's colours and the big reefs it conforms; it could also means "person of virtue". ''Ringo'' is also phonetically the same as the word {{nihongo|''Ringo''|林檎}} which means "Apple".&lt;br /&gt;

===Design===
Ringo has red eyes and short blonde hair, and two short, drooping rabbit's ears. Her outfit consists of an orange patterned crop top, yellow patterned pumpkin breeches, and a brown patterned newsboy cap. She is seen holding a bunch of [[Wikipedia:Dango|dango]] on her left hand and a skewer with a dango on her right hand.

==Appearances==
{{stub|section}}
;''Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom''
[[File:Th15RingoSprite.png|frame|Ringo's sprite in ''LoLK'']]
Ringo shows interest in the protagonists after receiving information about them from [[Seiran]] and decides to fight against them. After losing, she shows some type of attachment to the Earth and lack of interest in the Lunar Capital plan, letting the player continue with their journey. 

==Literature==

;''Alternative Facts in Eastern Utopia''
[[Aya Shameimaru]] reports the competition between [[Seiran]] and Ringo of who sells more dango in the [[Human Village]]. Aya claims Ringo is winning but that she supports Seiran, although she explains that she does it because she always wants to support the weak part. 

==Relationships==
;Seiran
Both are members of the ''"Eagle Ravi" Earth Recon Unit'' sent to "purify" the Earth. After the events of Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom they both deserted the moon and became business rivals as Dango salesgirls.

Being an information manager, she actually knew&lt;br /&gt;
that the [[Lunar Capital]] they thought they were currently residing in was actually in the [[Dream World]].&lt;br /&gt;
However, she didn't know why such a situation had occurred.&lt;br /&gt;
Perhaps if she found that out, she'd swiftly be dealt with.&lt;br /&gt;

She sent the humans who came her way into the passage that connected to the Dream World's Lunar Capital.&lt;br /&gt;
In so doing, she indirectly investigated the matter.

{{nihongo|'''Rinnosuke Morichika'''|森近　霖之助|Morichika Rinnosuke}}, nicknamed {{nihongo|'''Kourin'''|香霖}} by [[Marisa Kirisame]], is the main protagonist of ''[[Curiosities of Lotus Asia]]'' and one of the few male characters depicted in the ''[[Touhou Project]]''. He is a half-[[human]] half-[[youkai]] hybrid with the ability to know the name and purpose of an object by examining it. He runs [[Kourindou]], an antique shop specializing in items from the [[Outside World]].

==General Information==
[[File:PMiSS_rinnosuke.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Illustration of Rinnosuke in ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'']]
Rinnosuke is the main protagonist of ''[[Curiosities of Lotus Asia]]'' and has been a recurring character in various mangas. He's the shop owner of [[Kourindou]] located between the [[Forest of Magic]] and the [[Human Village]]. He has a habit of collecting items that drop nearby from the [[outside world]], but due to his poor business sense, refusal to let go of any useful or interesting items, personality, location, niche merchandise, and inability to determine just how to use something, his business can be deemed a failure. He chose the location of Kourindou to do business with both humans and youkai, but he rarely ever has clients of either kind aside from a few (noisy) visitors.&lt;ref name="cola3"&gt;[[Curiosities of Lotus Asia/Chapter 03|Curiosities of Lotus Asia: Chapter 3]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Rinnosuke had been to the outside world long ago. He remarks about the "outside world I knew", and tries to imagine it from old memories, but too much time has elapsed.&lt;ref name="cola3"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; By the time he visits it again in a dream-like sequence in [[Curiosities of Lotus Asia/Chapter 11|''Curiosities of Lotus Asia''&lt;nowiki&gt;'s&lt;/nowiki&gt; 11th chapter]], it's a completely alien environment to him.

===Personality===
Rinnosuke has a calm and analytical demeanor, and has a tendency to keep to himself. He rarely argues or voices negative opinions of others, preferring to avoid fights.&lt;ref&gt;[[Curiosities of Lotus Asia/Chapter 01|Curiosities of Lotus Asia: chapter 1]]&lt;/ref&gt; Though he's rather curious, he prefers not to show it and tends to feign ignorance. He claims to prefer to keep his nose out of things, but tends to listen to the conversation of others.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wild and Horned Hermit]], chapter 34&lt;/ref&gt; He pretends to ignore happenings around his shop but will attempt to goad others into telling him whatever is happening.&lt;ref&gt;[[Curiosities of Lotus Asia/Chapter 08|Curiosities of Lotus Asia: chapter 8]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Rinnosuke has a know-it-all attitude, he is always excited to use his ability to explain things to others, even if he can't actually confirm its correctness, to the point of rambling exhaustive explanations to both himself and others. He tends to overthink his appraisal of items, to the point of it becoming wild guesses and over-the-top conclusions of the abilities of mundane items. This attitude means that, once he starts explaining things, he won't stop going into many semi-related stories until told to stop.&lt;ref&gt;[[Forbidden Scrollery]], chapter 27&lt;/ref&gt; That said, he does genuinely enjoy explaining things to others if asked.

Although he won't admit it, like [[Marisa Kirisame]], he has a bit of a hoarding habit with his shop's collection of items. Though he would claim that these items are products to be sold, not many customers buy them. He does not mind destroying or parting with some of the more dangerous or mysterious items he has, however.&lt;ref&gt;[[Curiosities of Lotus Asia/Chapter 12|Curiosities of Lotus Asia: chapter 12]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abilities===
Apparently, Rinnosuke doesn't have any fighting abilities like [[Reimu Hakurei]] or [[Marisa Kirisame]] do, which makes him an ideal character to describe typical daily life in [[Gensokyo]]. [[ZUN]] has stated that Rinnosuke isn't the type to use spell cards, but he perhaps might.&lt;ref name="MU talkshow DoT"&gt;[[Meiji University talkshow "Dawn of Touhou"]]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'' states that he is not very strong due to a lack of training. Additionally, in [[ZUN's reply to messages on the former Gensou Bulletin Board 3|a reply to a question on the former Gensou Bulletin Board]], it was stated that he actually cannot fight with Reimu and other characters using [[danmaku]].

;Knowing the name and utility of tools
By examining any man-made object, Rinnosuke can learn its name and what it's used for. However, he only learns of the object's name and utility, and doesn't know how to actually use said object. The information he receives can sometimes be vague or confusing - for example, from examining a PC, he's able to know that it's a personal computer and that it's a tool for collecting and processing information, but he doesn't know how to operate it.&lt;ref name="cola16"&gt;[[Curiosities of Lotus Asia/Chapter 16|Curiosities of Lotus Asia: Chapter 16]]&lt;/ref&gt;

He lacks an overall understanding about the outside and modern science, so he often ends up drawing strange conclusions about certain items (in one case leading him to mistake a [[wikipedia:Game Boy|Game Boy]] for a doomsday device).&lt;ref&gt;[[Curiosities of Lotus Asia/Chapter_12|Curiosities of Lotus Asia: Chapter 12]]&lt;/ref&gt; This even extends to his theories about [[Gensokyo]]. [[ZUN]] mentions that Rinnosuke doesn't know as much as he thinks he does and his various hypotheses about everything are mostly pulled out of thin air.&lt;ref name="cola_afterword"&gt;[[Curiosities of Lotus Asia/Afterword|Curiosities of Lotus Asia: Afterword]]&lt;/ref&gt;

;Creation of magic items
Rinnosuke made the [[Mini-Hakkero]] when Marisa left her parents' home.&lt;ref name="cola6"&gt;[[Curiosities of Lotus Asia/Chapter 06|Curiosities of Lotus Asia: Chapter 6]]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite it's small size, it has extraordinary heating power, to the point of being able to reduce a mountain to ashes. It was made with various improvements and special qualities, ranging from being a cooler in the summer due to the wind blowing from its reactors to being an air purifier. Marisa uses it in daily life, most famously in combat as a conductor for the ''Master Spark''. It's unknown just to what extent Rinnosuke can create or modify objects, but adding hihiirokane to the Mini-Hakkero at Marisa's request was his "first big job in a while" and adding various features is something he considers a hobby and part of his customer service.&lt;ref name="cola7"&gt;[[Curiosities of Lotus Asia/Chapter 07|Curiosities of Lotus Asia: Chapter 7]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Species===
Rinnosuke is a [[half-youkai]]. Because of this, youkai don't attack him and he doesn't attack humans.&lt;ref&gt;[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]: [[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Rinnosuke's Store|Rinnosuke's Store]]&lt;/ref&gt; Being a human-youkai hybrid, Rinnosuke only needs to drink a cup of sake with a couple of side vegetables to provide enough sustenance for a meal, but full meals are preferred.&lt;ref&gt;[[Curiosities of Lotus Asia/Chapter 26|Curiosities of Lotus Asia: Chapter 26]]&lt;/ref&gt; He avoids staying in the [[Human Village]] for long because his lack of aging brings unease to the humans there.&lt;ref name="Cola20"&gt;[[Curiosities of Lotus Asia/Chapter 20|Curiosities of Lotus Asia: Chapter 20]]&lt;/ref&gt; Also, he's resistant to both human diseases and youkai diseases, but he can still get ill every once in a rare while.&lt;ref&gt;[[Curiosities of Lotus Asia/Chapter 23|Curiosities of Lotus Asia: Chapter 23]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Backstory==
Rinnosuke seems to have originally lived in the [[outside world]], though he is unable to remember much about it. He used to work as an apprentice for [[Marisa's unnamed father|Marisa's father]] at his store in the village. However, his ability and interest in the outside wasn't being put to its best use with the human customers, so he decided to strike out on his own. He created the Mini-Hakkero as a gift for Marisa when she cut ties with her family. He then opened Kourindou, which he still resides in.

==Character Design==
===Name===
His full name is {{nihongo|''Rinnosuke Morichika''|森近　霖之助}}. His surname {{nihongo||森近|Morichika}} means "near the forest", which is the location of [[Kourindou]], near the [[Forest of Magic]]. The name is an actual place name, family name or surname. His first name {{nihongo||霖之助|Rinnosuke}} means "helps the long rain", and it possibly has something to do with [[Marisa Kirisame]] since her last name, "Kirisame", means drizzle. His nickname {{nihongo|Kourin|香霖}} is a short-form of ''Kourindou''.

===Design===
Rinnosuke has golden eyes, short silver hair and wears a pair of glasses. His clothes are black and blue, and he often carries a small bag with him. His appearance has not changed since Marisa was a small child, indicating his status as a half-youkai.

==Appearances==
===Literature===
;''Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red''
:{{Main|Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red/Rinnosuke|l1=Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red: Rinnosuke}}
One day, a hookah (called a nargile in the article) appears for sale in [[Kourindou]]. [[Aya Shameimaru]] comes to write an article about it and offer her opinion. Unfortunately, Rinnosuke has no idea how to use the device, despite knowing its function. He proposes that it be used as a decoration.

Some time after the article is written, Aya comes back to see if the hookah had been sold. Rinnosuke informs her that he decided to keep it for himself after being taught (by [[Yukari Yakumo]]) how to use it. Aya wonders out loud if he really intends to run a business. She considers the odd hookah to be nonsensical. Rinnosuke counters by stating that all luxury goods are nonsensical, and that people who buy them are interesting. Aya agrees with him.
[[File:WaHHRinnosuke.png|thumb|200px|Rinnosuke's appearance in [[Wild and Horned Hermit]]]]
;''Silent Sinner in Blue''
In Chapter 3 of ''[[Silent Sinner in Blue]]'', [[Sakuya Izayoi]] is sent to [[Kourindou]] in order to buy reference materials on rockets, arriving in the evening when Rinnosuke has already closed up shop. After he shows Sakuya some materials on the Apollo program, she purchases them.
[[File:FSRinnosuke.jpg|thumb|200px|Rinnosuke's appearance in [[Forbidden Scrollery]]]]
;''Cage in Lunatic Runagate''
In Chapter 7 of ''[[Cage in Lunatic Runagate]]'', [[Cage in Lunatic Runagate/Seventh Chapter|Half-body Half-honor]], [[Youmu Konpaku]] visits Kourindou hoping to learn what it is that Sakuya had purchased from the store. While Rinnosuke denies her the information, after Youmu mentions rockets, he informs her about the Apollo program. However, since the materials on it have been bought, Rinnosuke informs her of books with similar contents that Youmu purchases instead.
;''Eastern and Little Nature Deity''
Appearing only in the bonus written story ''[[Fairy of the Moon]]'', the [[Three Fairies of Light]] visited Kourindou to inquire about a fluorescent lamp. Rinnosuke explains to them what it is and is somewhat disgusted by their lack of intelligent responses. He proceeds to lecture them about the origin of the name of the fluorescent lamp.
;''Wild and Horned Hermit''
In Chapter 34 of [[Wild and Horned Hermit]], Kasen visits Rinnosuke's shop in order to meet with Sumireko as usual, to which Rinnosuke tries to object but is quickly persuaded. Kasen uses the moment to talk with Rinnosuke about Reimu's situation of low confidence and some way to cheer her up.
;''Forbidden Scrollery''
In Chapter 26 and 27 of ''[[Forbidden Scrollery]]'', [[Kosuzu Motoori]] is brought to Kourindou by Marisa in order to learn about a Ouija board that her father had found. Rinnosuke gives a long explanation to the two, lasting into the evening before he finally lets them go home.
===Games===
[[File:Th135Rinnosuke.png|frame|Rinnosuke in ''[[HM]]'']]
Rinnosuke has made his first ever appearance in a ''[[Touhou Project]]'' game in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'', but only as a background cameo character on the [[Human Village]] stage. Additionally, he's been mentioned in game dialogue (as Kourin) in [[Marisa Kirisame]]'s ''[[Immaterial and Missing Power]]'' ending when she thinks about showing [[Suika Ibuki]] to him, as well as in her ''[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]'' versus script. [[Nazrin]] also mentions obtaining the Jeweled Pagoda from "[[Undefined Fantastic Object: Sanae B's Scenario#Stage 5|a second-hand goods shop]]", which could be [[Kourindou]]. Kourindou also appears as a [[stage]] location in ''[[Urban Legend in Limbo]]'' and ''[[Antinomy of Common Flowers]]''.

===Fanworks===
{{main|Canon}}

Rinnosuke made an unofficial appearance in the [[fangame]] ''[[Touhou Unreal Mahjong]]'' by [[D.N.A. Softwares]]. [[ZUN]] had involvement with the game and composed his theme "Curious Old Shanghai Tile".

==Relationships==
Since he rarely leaves [[Kourindou]] and has a somewhat difficult personality, Rinnosuke is mostly acquainted with those who come by his store, either as freeloaders or the few customers he has.

====Marisa Kirisame &amp; her Family====
Rinnosuke worked for [[Marisa's unnamed father|Marisa's father]] at his shop as an apprentice in the [[Human Village]] before leaving to start [[Kourindou]] over eleven years ago before [[Marisa Kirisame]] was born, and he's known Marisa since she was small. She must have known him at least since 2001, as from [[Curiosities of Lotus Asia/Chapter 06|''Curiosities of Lotus Asia'' chapter 6]]'s prologue, Marisa once eavesdropped on a conversation between Rinnosuke and her father during one of Rinnosuke's rare visits to the Kirisame residence. Marisa thinks Rinnosuke is stiff with her because of her family, but the truth is Rinnosuke keeps his guard up with her because he doesn't want her to suspect when he's lying to her, particularly when it comes to her paying Rinnosuke with items that she collects.

Rinnosuke refers to her dad as the "human whom I had received hospitality from long time ago," indicating it was Marisa's father that took him in. Rinnosuke used to make rare visits to the Kirisame residence even after that, but hasn't visited him for 10 years,&lt;ref name="Cola20" /&gt; presumably because he ran away to start his own shop. Rinnosuke was a little nervous about seeing him again due to the time that elapsed since then, but from Rinnosuke's meeting with him, there doesn't seem to be any bad blood between them.&lt;ref name="Cola20" /&gt;

Rinnosuke sees Marisa as something of an annoyance, as she often imposes herself on him and takes what she likes from the store, but they are still on good terms and he seems to welcome her company. They're friendly enough that he created and later gave her the Hakkero. She's also the only one to call him by his nickname "Kourin", although whether it implies fondness, or just that they've known each other for so long, is unknown. 

Because of Marisa's collecting habits, Rinnosuke is often able to get valuable things she picks up for quite cheap, as Marisa usually doesn't know the true value of the item. However, he does feel somewhat bad about it.&lt;ref name="cola7"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

====Reimu Hakurei====
He's lived long enough to know about the [[Hakurei Shrine]] and the generations of Hakurei who have come before, but it's unknown if this means he was acquainted with [[Reimu Hakurei]]'s family. She's nearly as much of an annoyance as Marisa, but he tolerates and gives much leeway to her. However, from Rinnosuke's point of view, Reimu doesn't resolve incidents because they're bothering people, but rather because she just likes to stick her neck out into strange events. It is said that he originally prepared Reimu's [[purification rod]] and shrine maiden clothing for her use.&lt;ref name="cola2"&gt;[[Curiosities of Lotus Asia/Chapter 02|Curiosities of Lotus Asia: Chapter 2]]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sumireko Usami====
Sumireko is a common visitor of Kourindou since she came to Gensokyo, using it as a point of reunion with Reimu and other people for her travels, while chatting with Rinnosuke about objects and life on the outside world as some business intel for him

===Minor Relationships===

====Yukari Yakumo====
[[Yukari Yakumo]] and Rinnosuke mostly have a business arrangement. In exchange for fuel for his kerosene fan heater, Yukari takes merchandise she likes and occasionally provides information on items. While he is grateful, Rinnosuke also doesn't like dealing with her all that much and makes note of how ominous she seems.

====Sakuya Izayoi====
[[Sakuya Izayoi]] is a customer who comes by the shop occasionally, mostly on the whims of her mistress, [[Remilia Scarlet]].

====Laika====
[[Laika]] is Rinnosuke's pet, a dog which reincarnated in a pet robot. At first Rinnosuke thought of it as a bother because it was making a mess in his shop, but soon after learning about being a reincarnation of the spirit of a dog, he decided to adopt it.

==Additional Information==
*Rinnosuke is the first literary character to be mentioned in a ''[[Touhou Project]]'' game. [[Aya Shameimaru]] and the [[Three Fairies of Light]] also appeared in later installments, the former having made multiple appearances throughout the series and the latter as [[boss]]es in ''[[Fairy Wars]]''.
*Other male characters besides Rinnosuke exist, but most of them are either not named (various [[human]]s shown in ''Hopeless Masquerade'', [[Marisa's unnamed father]]), not humanoid ([[Genjii]], [[Sokrates]], [[Unzan]]), do not have official appearances ([[Youki Konpaku]], [[Myouren Hijiri]]) or have no dialogue ([[SinGyoku]] in [[Highly Responsive to Prayers]]). Another male character with a name and an official appearance is [[Unshou]].
*Rinnosuke and Yukari are often credited as the two people from Gensokyo who have some idea regarding the [[outside world]], with a basic understanding of technology. Other characters may also know about the outside, but there is no direct description by [[ZUN]] so far. Of course, this does not include [[Sanae Kochiya]], [[Kanako Yasaka]], [[Suwako Moriya]], [[Mamizou Futatsuiwa]] and, [[Sumireko Usami]] who are all from the outside world.
*He's one of only a few characters with glasses, the others being [[Rikako Asakura]], [[Mamizou Futatsuiwa]] and [[Sumireko Usami]].
*It's often pointed out that Rinnosuke shares some personal points with {{nihongo|''Akihiko Chuuzenji''|中禅寺秋彦}}, one of the main characters of a novel series written by [[wikipedia:Natsuhiko Kyogoku|Natsuhiko Kyougoku]], who ZUN is known to love. One of the points is that Akihiko manages a used-book shop named {{nihongo|"Kyougokudou"|京極堂}}, which is also his nickname; this resembles "Kourin" except it lacks the suffix "dou".

{{nihongo|'''Rumia'''|ルーミア|Ruumia}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20040404190222/www16.big.or.jp/~zun/cgi-bin/diary/nicky.cgi?page=1 Winter Comic Thanks N° 2 (ZUN's Diary's post on 4th January 2004)]&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[youkai]] with the ability of manipulating the darkness. She is one of the few youkai that doesn't seem to belong to any particular species.

==General Information==
Rumia first appeared as the Stage 1 Boss of ''[[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]]'', and later as a Level 1 target in ''[[Shoot the Bullet]]''. She also made an appearance as a background character in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]''.
===Personality===
Rumia is apparently quite simple-minded and doesn't like the sunlight nor the summer heat; in fact, she uses her powers of darkness to surround herself in a mass of dark, as to avoid the heat and the light. It is also said that she only uses this power as a supportive ability when attacking others, using pure strength as her main asset. She seems like to fly around aimlessly during the day and the night, sometimes bumping into trees since she is less capable of seeing obstacles through her veil of darkness.&lt;ref name="baijr"&gt;[[Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red/Rumia|Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red: Rumia Article and Interview]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmiss"&gt;[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Rumia|Perfect Memento in Strict Sense: Rumia Article]]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite her innocent appearance, she eats [[human]]s and thinks that a [[youkai]]'s job is to hunt them down, but she also seems to be quite lazy and has commented that it is generally a pain for her doing it.&lt;ref name="baijr"/&gt;

Rumia's skin and hair are photosensitive, so maybe that is the reason she surrounds herself with shadows although she can't see through them.&lt;ref name="baijr"/&gt;

===Ability===
;Manipulating darkness
Rumia has the ability of manipulating darkness. By covering herself in pure darkness, she is able to prevent sunlight from passing through the darkness, as it is magical in nature and can render even traditional lights such as torches useless within it. Because of this, people who happen to go inside the darkness would not able to see anything, but it looks like Rumia herself is also less capable to see, as she might crash into trees while flying. However, she was still able to read [[Aya Shameimaru|Aya's]] newspaper even with almost no light, while Aya herself couldn't write notes nor reading her notebook. She has also shown that she can control how much light can pass through the darkness, as she let only a bit of it entering to be able to read the newspaper.&lt;br /&gt; 
The appearance of the darkness outside its region looks like a spherical circle that is moving. Rumia says "I'm fine in moonlight" meaning she doesn't need such ability at night, and although she dislikes heat and sunlight, she was seen without darkness in broad daylight in various occasions, even in summer.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oriental Sacred Place]]'' - Chapter 12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Visionary Fairies in Shrine]]'' - Chapter 9.5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Visionary Fairies in Shrine]]'' - Chapter 11.5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In-game, this ability is used as part of Rumia's [[Shoot_the_Bullet/Spell_Cards/Level_1#Spell_Card_1_-_4|Darkness Sign "Dark Side of the Moon"]] spellcard in ''[[Shoot the Bullet]]'', during which she becomes impossible to photograph when she is covered in darkness.&lt;br /&gt;
The names of her spell cards are also related to night and darkness (''Moon Sign'', ''Night Sign'', ''Darkness Sign'').

==Character Design==
[[File:PMiSS_rumia.jpg|thumb|right|150px]]

===Origin===	
ZUN has mentioned in an interview&lt;ref&gt;"The Chief Priest ZUN talks about Mountain of Faith!" Chara☆Mel Vol.3, Ichijinsha, Dec 2007, pp.104-111.&lt;/ref&gt; that because it was the first Windows game, he decided to go with the concept of ''Embodiment of Scarlet Devil'' as a {{nihongo||[[wikipedia:ja:落ち#出落ち|出落ち]]|deochi|lit. "[[wikipedia:Punch line|punch line]] on the entrance"}} as a main theme. This is why her ability (manipulation of darkness) is an example of ''deochi''; it seems like it would be appropriate to a final boss, yet she is only a stage 1 boss.

===Name===
"Rumia" (ルーミア), possibly meant to be romanized as "Lumia", seems to come from the Latin word ''lumen'' ("light") or its English descendants (''luminous'', ''luminescent''). Supporting this possible origin is the subject matter of her first spell card, ''Moon Sign "Moonlight Ray"''. If "Lumia" is indeed the intended romanization of her name, then it may be that her ability to manipulate and create darkness works by absorbing light. ZUN, however, has used "Rumia" in a [http://web.archive.org/web/20040404190222/www16.big.or.jp/~zun/cgi-bin/diary/nicky.cgi?page=1 2004 diary post] (although he also used the rather erroneous "Frandre" in the same instance), and even supervised [https://web.archive.org/web/20100315044145/http://www.comptiq.com/release/comic/55touhou_owabi.html an official correction] from "Lumia" to "Rumia". "Rumia" was also used on her [[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]] portrait.

===Design===
Rumia's design shows that she has red eyes and short blonde hair. She wears a black vest and skirt, and white blouse with a red tie bordered by two large red beads around her neck. She also has small red [[ofuda]] tied to the left side of her hair, making it look like a ribbon. However, she can neither touch nor remove the amulet. According to ZUN, her height is that of a human in her early teens (from 10 to 14 years old).&lt;ref&gt;[[ZUN/ZUN's E-mails|ZUN's E-Mails]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearances==
===Games===
;''Embodiment of Scarlet Devil''
[[File:Th06RumiaSprite.png|frame|Rumia's sprite in ''EoSD'']]
:{{Main|Embodiment of Scarlet Devil/Story|l1=Embodiment of Scarlet Devil Story}}
In the events of ''[[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]]'', Rumia bumps into either [[Reimu Hakurei]] or [[Marisa Kirisame]] near the [[Hakurei Shrine]] during her aimless wanderings and attacks them, as other youkai won't do. She is defeated quickly.

===Spin-offs===
;''Shoot the Bullet''
[[File:Th095RumiaSprite.png|frame|Rumia's sprite in ''StB'']]
Rumia appeared in ''[[Shoot the Bullet]]'' as a stage 1 target. [[Aya Shameimaru]] commented that she had some trouble dealing with her, since she attacked suddenly while in the darkness, and complained about how the photos she got were no good because it was too dark.

;''Hopeless Masquerade''
[[File:Th135Rumia.png|frame|Rumia in ''HM'']]
Rumia appears as a background character in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'', on the [[Hall of Dreams' Great Mausoleum]] stage. She is seen looking at the fights while still mantaining her "crucifixion pose".

===Literature===
;''Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red''
{{Main|Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red/Rumia}}
When interviewed by Aya, Rumia complained that other youkai were coming into her darkness because the article Aya had written suggested they could also avoid the light and heat like her by doing so. She also complained when Aya requested there be enough light for her to take notes, as it seems that being often in the darkness makes Rumia's eyes very sensitive to light. Aya was a bit disappointed that Rumia has no goals in life.

;''Oriental Sacred Place''
Rumia appears in ''[[Oriental Sacred Place]]'' to participate in a test of guts being held at the [[Hakurei Shrine]], along with [[Sakuya Izayoi]], [[Youmu Konpaku]], [[Yuyuko Saigyouji]], [[Wriggle Nightbug]], [[Mystia Lorelei]], and [[Cirno]]. At that time, she is first seen talking with Mystia and Wriggle, and then within her sphere of darkness while chasing Youmu. She also reappears later in a similar crowd when the [[Three Fairies of Light]] were preparing a festival at the [[Hakurei Shrine]]. Rumia, however, did not seem like she was part of the preparation and wasn't visible during the festival itself.

;''Silent Sinner in Blue''
She appears in ''[[Silent Sinner in Blue]]'', participating to the party given in the [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]] by [[Remilia Scarlet]] to celebrate the completion of the rocket that will send Remilia's group to the Moon. While at the party, Rumia is noticed to be talking to [[Wriggle Nightbug]].

==Additional Information==
*She is the first official [[Windows]] boss of the ''[[Touhou Project]]''.
*She is usually drawn with her arms spread out, claiming the pose appears to say, "The saint was crucified." 
*[[Play, Doujin!]] localizes her name as "Lumia" in their translations, even though ZUN himself and the rest of the Touhou doujin community uses Rumia.
*Rumia's non-spell card attacks and her spell card ''[[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil/Spell Cards/Stage 1#Spell Card 01|Moon Sign "Moonlight Ray"]]'' are similar to the attacks of ''[[Mystic Square]]'''s first stage boss, [[Sara]].
*When talking to Rumia during ''[[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]]'', Marisa references the phrase "{{lang|ja|人類は十進法を採用しました}}" (Mankind adopted the decimal system). It comes from [[Wikipedia:Hiroshi Mori (writer)|MORI Hiroshi's]] novel "{{lang|ja|誰もいなくなった　～ }}Thirty Little Indians" (Then There Were None ~ Thirty Little Indians) from "{{lang|ja|まどろみ消去 ～}}Missing under the Mistletoe" (Slumber Erasing ~ Missing under the Mistletoe).
&lt;blockquote&gt;
{{lang|ja|近づいて、フカシとヨーコが手を振ると、西之園萌絵は、&lt;br/&gt;
両手を顔の横で広げてみせた。&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Coming closer, Fukashi and Yōko waved their hands, then Moe Nishinosono&lt;br/&gt;
spread her hands next to her face.&lt;br/&gt;
This wasn't the gesture of Man adopting the decimal system.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
: The author commented this phrase was put in to show that she didn't spread her arms to the full extent like the character {{lang|ja|十}}, but that she spread her ten fingers as if she'd counted to 10.
::*Also, her sigil, shown on [[The Grimoire of Marisa]] depicts mistletoe.
*Rumia was one of the characters ZUN wanted to include in [[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]. However, she was eventually scrapped.&lt;ref&gt;[[Strange Creators of Outer World/Iruka Unabara x ZUN interview|Strange Creators of Outer World - Interview with Iruka Unabara and ZUN]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ability: Manipulating darkness


Stage 1 boss. A [[youkai]].

She is of no importance to the story, and isn't up to anything in particular in her life. The ribbon tied to her hair is actually a charm; she can't touch it even though there have been times when she wanted to take it off.

There is no evidence of her ability to manipulate darkness in the game, but in truth, places around her are always as dark as night.

Total of three card attacks.

ストーリー的には重要なキャラではないんですが、いつも暗闇になるという能力が、日光を嫌う吸血鬼を彷彿させるように配置してあります。ルーミアのリボンには秘密があるという設定でしたが、今のところ活かされてないですね(笑)
| translation = It's been a long time since the last title, so I wanted to have a character that's full of surprise, and here she is. She's a girl with a serious power that controls darkness yet her first line is so bright and casual starting with "so-nanoka-." I like her because she's the representation of Touhou's world being contrarian where the savage becomes relaxed.&lt;br/&gt;
Although she's not an important figure in the narrative, her ability to be in the dark at any time was set to create an association with vampires who despise sunlight. Her ribbon was designed to have some secrets within, but it hasn't been used so far. (lol)

{{nihongo|'''Ruukoto'''|るーこと}} is the robot [[maid]] that [[Reimu Hakurei]] requested in the ending of ''[[Phantasmagoria of Dim.Dream]]''. Although she is enthusiastic about doing chores, she isn't very good at them. She is also nuclear powered.

==Character Basis==
===Origin===
Ruukoto's character design is thought to be a parody of [[Multi]]'s since, as well as being an android, Multi is also not very good at cleaning.

===Name===
Her name {{nihongo|''Ruukoto''|るーこと}} is named after the character Ruukoto Sanagawa from [[wikipedia:Izumi Takemoto|Izumi Takemoto]]'s manga ''Sayori na Parallel''.

===Design===
Seen in Reimu's ending in ''[[Phantasmagoria of Dim.Dream]]'', Ruukoto wears a light-blue and white maid uniform with a red bow and a yellow radiation warning symbol on her back. She has light green hair.

==Story==
;''Phantasmagoria of Dim.Dream''
:{{Main|Phantasmagoria of Dim.Dream/Story#Reimu Hakurei's Ending|l1=Phantasmagoria of Dim.Dream Story}}
Reimu was granted a wish in her ending. She said she wanted something to clean the [[Hakurei Shrine]], so Yumemi insisted on giving Ruukoto to Reimu.

==Relationships==
;[[Yumemi Okazaki]] &amp; [[Reimu Hakurei]] 
Ruukoto used to be [[Yumemi Okazaki]]'s maid, but during Reimu's ending in ''[[Phantasmagoria of Dim.Dream]]'', Ruukoto becomes Reimu's maid. Because Ruukoto is from the [[PC-98]] era, it is unknown if Reimu still has Ruukoto.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Additional Information==
*Ruukoto is one of the few characters in the entire series to have appeared in a game without ever having been a playable character or a boss character.
*She is very similar to [[VIVIT]], who is from the ''[[Seihou Project]]''.
*One of [[Sakuya Izayoi]]'s alternate color schemes in ''[[Immaterial and Missing Power]]'' and ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]'' appears to be a homage to Ruukoto.

{{nihongo|'''Sagume Kishin'''|稀神 サグメ|Kishin Sagume}} is a [[Lunarian]] [[God|goddess]] (specifically, a [[divine spirit]]) who was indirectly responsible for the [[Urban Legend in Limbo|Urban Legend Incident]].

==General Information==
Sagume appeared as the Stage 4 midboss and Boss in ''[[Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom]]''.

===Personality===
Because of her powers to reverse fate when speaking, Sagume has to carefully choose what words she uses to speak. This resulted in her being taciturn and reserved, even picking up a habit of covering her lips with one hand. 

Strangely for a Lunarian, Sagume has displayed actions that goes against their ideologies. Despite being enemies with Gensokyo, Sagume had aided the realm on two separate occasions. The first time was in ''[[Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom]]'' where she forgoes her plan to relocate the Lunar Capital and places her faith in the protagonists, even going as far as giving one of them the Lunar Capital [[Occult Ball]] in the process &lt;ref name="MEnding"&gt;[[Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom]] - Marisa's Pointdevice/No Miss ending&lt;/ref&gt; (though it's a possibility that it could've been pragmatic on her part) and the second time was in ''[[Grimoire of Usami]]'' where she put a stop to the spreading chaos that plagued the fireworks festival with her words. Sagume's also on friendly terms with [[Eirin Yagokoro]] despite her status as a wanted fugitive and would frequently visit her. &lt;ref&gt;  ''[[Alternative Facts in Eastern Utopia]]'' - Sagume's article &lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Hecatia Lapislazuli]] surmised that Sagume would've attempted to control Gensokyo through [[Aya Shameimaru]]'s dishonest articles about isolationism if she were to publish it &lt;ref&gt; ''[[Alternative Facts in Eastern Utopia]]'' - Hecatia's interview &lt;/ref&gt;, though it's uncertain if Sagume would've wanted to do it.

===Abilities===
;Reversing a situation with her words
When she speaks about a particular situation or event, that situation will eventually proceed to reverse itself, through whatever means possible. If she speaks about an attempt to achieve a goal, it will fail in some way. If she speaks about something bad occurring, it will be resolved in some way. Due to this, she tends to not speak too much and always chooses her words carefully. Note that it is the situation or the event she talks about that will be reversed in some manner; it is not that the opposite of what she says must occur.

In ''Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom'', Sagume had thought of a backup plan to move the [[Lunar Capital]] to Gensokyo in case [[Junko]]'s actions eventually forced the Lunarians to leave their temporary refuge in the [[Dream World]]. However, when the player shows up to take care of Junko, Sagume realizes her opportunity to help save the Lunar Capital. By talking to the protagonist about their plan to invade Gensokyo, her ability ensures that the plan will not come to fruition. By doing so, Sagume bets on the likelihood that the reason they will not end up relocating to Gensokyo is because the protagonist will in fact save the Lunar Capital. By talking to the player directly, she forced the situation to reverse around them.

;Occult Balls
Using her powers, Sagume created a secret [[occult ball]]. It had the power to change the world by using people's words, and merely being near it would cause false rumors, such as urban legends, to materialize. Although it was just insurance, the plan was to use it to materialize the Lunar Capital in Gensokyo by spreading rumors about NASA hiding the truth about what they saw on the Moon. This also caused numerous lesser urban legends to materialize, starting the events of ''[[Urban Legend in Limbo]]''. It is currently in possession of [[Marisa Kirisame]] &lt;ref name="MEnding"/&gt;.

===Species===
She is a goddess, but she has a part of her that is a {{nihongo|Heavenly God|天津神|Amatsukami}} represented by the sole wing on her back and a part that is a {{nihongo|Earthly God|土着神|Kunitsukami}}&lt;ref name=LoLKInterview&gt;[[Strange Creators of Outer World/Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom interview with ZUN|Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom interview with ZUN]]&lt;/ref&gt;. Other than being a Lunarian, Sagume can also "tentatively" be classified as a [[divine spirit]], but it is said that her true nature isn't that of a [[god]], an [[oni]], or a departed soul. She could be considered a type of [[amanojaku]], but she is actually far above them &lt;ref name="Musc" &gt;[[Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom/Music]] - Sagume Kishin's theme comments&lt;/ref&gt;, and could also be considered separate from them&lt;ref&gt;[[Strange Creators of Outer World/Who's Who of Humans &amp; Youkai in Gensokyo/Sagume Kishin|Who's Who of Humans &amp; Youkai in Gensokyo - Sagume Kishin]]&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Character Design==
[[File:FSSagumeHairBraid.png|thumb|right|180px|Sagume's braid as seen in [[Forbidden Scrollery]]]]

===Origin===
Sagume may be based in part on {{nihongo|Ame-no-Sagume|天探女}}, who is thought to be the basis of [[amanojaku]] folklore.

===Name===
Her full name is {{nihongo|''Sagume Kishin''|稀神サグメ}}. Her last name, Kishin ({{lang|ja|稀神}}), means "rare god". It differs from {{nihongo|[[kishin]]|鬼神}}, which means "oni god" and the Kijin in {{nihongo|[[Seija Kijin]]|鬼人}}, which means "oni human" and forms a part of her and Seija's species, [[amanojaku]].&lt;ref name="Musc" &gt;[[Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom/Music]] - Sagume Kishin's theme comments&lt;/ref&gt;

[[ZUN]] also relates her with {{nihongo|''sagi''|サギ}} which means {{nihongo|[[wikipedia:heron|Heron]]|鷺|sagi}} and can also be read as {{nihongo|[[wikipedia:swindler|swindler]]|詐欺|sagi}}.&lt;ref name=LoLKInterview /&gt;

===Design===
Sagume has short, light grey hair with a braid on the back, red eyes, and a single wing on her back. She wears a purple dress, the bottom of which is cut into an arrow pattern, with a red microphone bowtie, a tan jacket, and brown shoes.

==Appearances==
[[File:Th15SagumeSprite.png|frame|Sagume's sprite in ''LoLK'']]
===Games===
;''Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom''

Sagume encounters the protagonists in the already deserted [[Lunar Capital]], after revealing the nature of their visit she proceeds to test their strength to see if they're capable of confronting [[Junko|the person attacking the Moon]] and, by consequence, stop the invasion to [[Gensokyo]].
===Spin-offs===
;''Antinomy of Common Flowers''

[[Byakuren Hijiri]] mentions Sagume as the culprit behind the [[Urban Legend in Limbo|Urban Legend Incident]] upon defeating [[Reisen Udongein Inaba]] in versus mode.

==Relationships==
;[[Eirin Yagokoro]]
Due to Eirin being a sage of the Moon before fleeing to the Earth, Sagume seemed be aware of her taking action during ''[[Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom]]'' events and calls her {{nihongo|''Lady Yagokoro''|八意様|Yagokoro-sama}}.&lt;br&gt;
Later, Sagume is seen speaking with Eirin in an article of ''[[Alternative Facts in Eastern Utopia]]'' by Aya, although the subject of the conversation is unknown.
;[[Reisen Udongein Inaba]]
When Reisen meets Sagume during ''[[Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom]]'' events, she recognizes her as one of the Goddesses and address her as proper. Sagume recognizes Reisen as "the rabbit that fell to Earth" from Eirin's place.

{{#lsth:List of Spell Cards/Touhou Project 3|[[Sagume Kishin]]}}
{{hidden end}}

==Additional Information==
*In most of her [[spell card]] and non-spell card attacks, she makes a lot of use of the [[flying yin-yangs]], a mysterious [[stage enemy]] that re-occurs in the ''[[Touhou Project]]'', as well as being primarily the only enemy of her stage.
*Even though she has a "defeated" sprite in the game's code, it is never used. [[ZUN]] made the image as part of his workflow, but didn't use it as the dialogue after battle is many times longer than the pre-battle dialogue, and didn't like Sagume being in a defeated state the whole time.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Strange Creators of Outer World]]'': ''[[Strange Creators of Outer World/Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom interview with ZUN|Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom interview]]'': Interviewer: "Even when Sagume loses, her clothes don't get messed up."; ZUN: "That's right. I have a picture of her, but I didn't use it (laugh). I drew it as part of my workflow, but it was a waste."; Interviewer: "Because she's strong?"; ZUN: "The dialogue before the battle is short, and the dialogue after it is long, so I couldn't have her stay in the defeated pose the whole time. And it would be embarrassing if her clothes were messed up when she was only testing their powers (laugh)." &lt;/ref&gt;
*In Marisa's Pointdevice/Legacy No Miss ending, Sagume had informed Marisa about the Occult Balls and seemingly gifted her the Lunar Capital ball. Yukari then told Marisa to "cherish her relationship with that one." It's unknown if they have any meaningful connections after their exchange.

　　稀神　サグメ&lt;br&gt;
　　Kisin Sagume&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

　　種族：月の民&lt;br&gt;
　　能力：口に出すと事態を逆転させる程度の能力&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

　　月の民である。&lt;br&gt;
　　普段、月の民の中では重要なポストにいて、余り表に出てこない。&lt;br&gt;
　　一応、神霊という部類に入るが、その性質は神とも鬼とも精霊とも付かない。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

　　無口な性格だが、その理由は能力にある。&lt;br&gt;
　　何らかの事象に対して（特に関係すると思われる人物に向かって）口にすると、&lt;br&gt;
　　その事象は逆に進み始めるのだ。&lt;br&gt;
　　似たようなものに天邪鬼がいるが、彼女は天邪鬼の上位にいる神霊である。&lt;br&gt;
　　天邪鬼は自分が反対の事を言うだけに対し、彼女は言った事で世界を反対に動かす。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

　　何かを成そうとしているのなら、それは尽く失敗するし、&lt;br&gt;
　　悪い事が起きているのなら、何らかの打破が見られる能力である。&lt;br&gt;
　　必ずしも自分に対して好転するわけでは無い。&lt;br&gt;
　　まさに、口は禍の元、となる神霊だ。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;


　　月の民の賢者達は、純狐による攻撃で穢れの侵食を防ぐため、月の都を凍結させた。&lt;br&gt;
　　それと同時に、月の民を夢の世界に避難させた。&lt;br&gt;
　　夢の世界の都は、みなが思うようないつも通りの月の都だった。&lt;br&gt;
　　そこにいる月の民達はそれを本物の都だと疑うことは無かった。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

　　しかし、いつまでも夢の世界に閉じ込めておく訳にもいかない。&lt;br&gt;
　　長い夢は精神を蝕みやすいのだ。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

　　その為、賢者達は保険として「月の都遷都計画」を打ち立てた。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

　　「月の都遷都計画」は、幻想郷を浄化し、そこに都を作る事だった。&lt;br&gt;
　　浄化とは、生死を無くすこと。&lt;br&gt;
　　つまり、全ての地上の生き物を殲滅することだった。&lt;br&gt;
　　しかしそう簡単にいく訳もない。相手は幻想郷に住む妖怪達だ。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

　　彼女は、幻想郷にはある都市伝説を広める事が近道と考えた。&lt;br&gt;
　　彼女の能力を使い秘密のパワーストーンを作った。&lt;br&gt;
　　そのパワーストーンは言葉で世界を変える力を持っていた。&lt;br&gt;
　　近くに有るだけで、存在しないはずの噂話（都市伝説）が具現化する&lt;br&gt;
　　という恐ろしい代物である。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

　　都市伝説が具現化するようになった頃、誰かが有名な都市伝説を&lt;br&gt;
　　広めるのを待つだけ、というのが彼女の計画だった。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

　　有名な都市伝説、それが「アポロ計画陰謀論」である。&lt;br&gt;
　　「ＮＡＳＡは月で見た真実を隠している」という与太話だ。&lt;br&gt;
　　つまり、ＮＡＳＡは月で見た文明を隠している、と噂になれば&lt;br&gt;
　　月の文明、すなわち月の都が幻想郷に具現化するという訳だ。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;


　　……しかし、この計画はあくまでも保険である。&lt;br&gt;
　　彼女も本気では無かったし、そもそも遷都を望んでいる民は&lt;br&gt;
　　誰もいなかった。出来れば月に戻りたかった。&lt;br&gt;
　　それでも何らかの手を打たないと行けないほど、純狐の攻撃は&lt;br&gt;
　　手の打ちようが無かったのである。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;



　　そんな時、幻想郷の人間がやってきた。&lt;br&gt;
　　まさかドレミーが月の都に人間を入れるとは思ってもみなかったが、&lt;br&gt;
　　彼女は人間の力を試し、強いことが判ると決意した。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

　　この人間に賭けよう。&lt;br&gt;
　　私が真実を喋れば、この人間を中心に事態は逆転する。&lt;br&gt;
　　自分が行ってきた遷都作戦は尽く失敗するが、純狐の作戦も失敗するからイーブンだ。&lt;br&gt;
　　後はこの人間がどうなってしようとも、月の都が救われれば……。

Sagume Kishin&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Species: Lunarian&lt;br&gt;
Ability: Capable of inverting a situation by speaking about it&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

A resident of the Moon.&lt;br&gt;
She normally occupies a very important post amongst the Moon's people, and doesn't often show herself publicly.&lt;br&gt;
She can tentatively be classified as a [[divine spirit]], but her nature is neither that of a god, nor oni, nor departed soul.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

She doesn't usually talk much, but this is a result of her ability.&lt;br&gt;
When she speaks about any particular situation, (particularly to those who are thought to be involved,)&lt;br&gt;
that situation will begin to proceed in its opposite way.&lt;br&gt;
This power is similar to that of [[amanojaku]], but she is a divine spirit ranked far above amanojaku.&lt;br&gt;
Amanojaku only speak contrarily, but in her case, with her words the world acts contrarily.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Should she try to accomplish something, it will end in failure,&lt;br&gt;
and if something bad is occurring, she has the ability to find a solution.&lt;br&gt;
It's not as if the situation will always improve for her personally.&lt;br&gt;
She's truly a divine spirit whose 'words can lead to disaster', as the saying goes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

To avoid the encroachment of impurity from Junko's attack, the sages of the Moon froze the Lunar Capital.&lt;br&gt;
At the same time, they evacuated the People of the Moon into the [[Dream World]].&lt;br&gt;
The Capital within the Dream World was just like the ordinary Lunar Capital that its residents imagined.&lt;br&gt;
The People of the Moon residing there never doubted that it was the real thing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

However, they certainly couldn't stay cooped up in the Dream World forever.&lt;br&gt;
The longer a dream becomes, the more it can erode one's mind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Thus, the sages proposed the "Lunar Capital Transfer Plan" as insurance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The "Lunar Capital Transfer Plan" was to purify Gensokyo and build a new capital there.&lt;br&gt;
To 'purify' is to eliminate life and death.&lt;br&gt;
That is to say, they were going to annihilate all the living things on its surface.&lt;br&gt;
However, it wouldn't be easy. Their opponents were the youkai living in Gensokyo.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

She thought that the spread of a particular urban legend in Gensokyo would make a good shortcut.&lt;br&gt;
Using her power, she created a secret Power Stone.&lt;br&gt;
That Power Stone had the power to change the world with people's words.&lt;br&gt;
Just by being near it, rumors (ie. urban legends) that shouldn't exist would materialize.&lt;br&gt;
A terrifying curio indeed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

When the urban legends began to materialize, she simply had to wait&lt;br&gt;
for someone to spread one particularly famous urban legend. That was the plan.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

That famous urban legend was the "Apollo Project Coverup Theory."&lt;br&gt;
An unfounded rumor that "NASA is hiding the truth of what they saw on the Moon."&lt;br&gt;
That is to say: if a rumor spread that NASA was hiding information about the lunar civilization they saw,&lt;br&gt;
that very civilization, the Lunar Capital, would materialize in Gensokyo.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

...however, this plan was no more than insurance.&lt;br&gt;
She wasn't totally serious about it, and none of the Moon's people wanted&lt;br&gt;
to move the capital to begin with. Returning to the Moon would be ideal.&lt;br&gt;
All the same, though, as much as they needed to fight back against Junko,&lt;br&gt;
they had no way of resisting her attack.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

It was then that one of Gensokyo's humans arrived.&lt;br&gt;
She never imagined that Doremy would send a human to the Lunar Capital,&lt;br&gt;
but decided to test the human's power anyway. She found that they were strong indeed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

''I'll place my bet on this human,'' she thought.&lt;br&gt;
''If I speak the truth to them, the situation will reverse itself with them at the center.''&lt;br&gt;
''My Capital Migration Strategy will fail, but since Junko's attack will also fail, we'll break even.''&lt;br&gt;
''It doesn't matter what this human will do afterward, as long as the Lunar Capital is saved...''

The '''Saigyou Ayakashi''' ({{lang|ja|西行妖}} ''Saigyou Ayakashi'') is a [[youkai]] [[wikipedia:Cherry blossom|cherry blossom tree]] and the largest in the gardens of [[Hakugyokurou]]. It has existed in the [[Netherworld]] longer than the Ghost Princess, [[Yuyuko Saigyouji]], herself. Some of the spirits in the Netherworld remember the Saigyou Ayakashi having the most beautiful blossoms they had ever seen, but the cherry tree has not bloomed for ages. There currently seems to be a powerful seal within the Saigyou Ayakashi, leaving it unable to blossom at all during spring. Whether the tree is sealing something or whether the tree itself is being sealed remains a mystery to most outsiders.

==Backstory==
A long time ago, there lived a divinely talented poet who traveled around [[Gensokyo]].  When the poet became aware that the hour of his death drew near, he chose to begin his eternal rest under the most beautiful cherry tree he could find.  After the poet's death, word of the beauty of the cherry tree began to spread across the land.  That cherry tree has grown even more beautiful since then, charming many people into choosing to rest in peace beneath its blossoms. 

After absorbing the blood of so many people, it turned into a youkai cherry tree with the ability to lure people to their death on its own, and came to be known as the Saigyou Ayakashi.  Eventually, the beautiful blossoms of the Saigyou Ayakashi were sealed away, using the bodies of Yuyuko and several others buried beneath it, and now remains within [[Hakugyokurou]].

==Character Basis==
===Name===
The poet referred in the Saigyou Ayakashi's story is likely [[Wikipedia:Saigyō Hōshi|Saigyou]], an ancient Buddhist poet who often sung of his love of cherry blossoms and his desire to die beneath flowers. ''Ayakashi'' is a general term for supernatural beings, very similar to ''youkai'' (the kanji for ''ayakashi'' [{{lang|ja|妖}}] is identical to the ''you'' in youkai [{{lang|ja|'''妖'''怪}}]). The tree's name would mean something like "youkai tree of Saigyou".

===Design===
Shown on its sprite, Saigyou Ayakashi is simply a very large cherry blossom tree which never fully blooms. It has no leaves in it.

==Story==
During the events of [[Perfect Cherry Blossom]], [[Yuyuko Saigyouji]], the ghost of the human Yuyuko, attempted to overpower the seal on the Saigyou Ayakashi in order to both see the legendary blossoms and to resurrect the soul that was sealed within.  However, Yuyuko was unaware that the sealed soul was in fact her own, and thus all of Yuyuko's attempts to unseal the soul failed due to her unconscious self-preservation.

==Relationships==
;[[Yuyuko Saigyouji]] (Sealed soul)
Yuyuko's corpse was buried under the Saigyou Ayakashi after she committed suicide.
;[[Youmu Konpaku]] (Gardener)

==Additional Information==
===Trivia===
*It is unknown if the tree can still drain the life out of people while it's not in [[Perfect Cherry Blossom#Story|full bloom]]. However, as the charm of its flowers has been removed, and due to it now residing in the Netherworld, it is largely not a real danger.
*It appears in Yuyuko's spell card background in [[Perfect Cherry Blossom]], [[Imperishable Night]], [[Shoot the Bullet]] and [[Ten Desires]].

The '''Sake Bug''' ({{lang|ja|酒虫}} ''Shuchuu'') is a companion of the oni created by a crystallization of their technology that is able to turn small amounts of water into sake in a night. The sake created from them has a complex and somewhat unrefined taste. They can exist in large vases, or their extract used in gourds such as [[Suika Ibuki|Suika]]'s. The sake bug looks like a [[namazu|catfish]]-like salamander.

==Story==
In [[Strange and Bright Nature Deity]], [[Reimu Hakurei|Reimu]] obtained a vase from Suika containing water and the sake bug. The [[Three Fairies of Light]], thinking that the vase contained sake, stole it and drank from it, but they were disappointed that there was no sake in it. Shortly after, they met [[Eirin Yagokoro]]. Eirin fooled the fairies into believing they ingested the sake bug and that it caused them to be unable to taste sake. To pay for a 'treatment' at [[Eientei]], the fairies gave the vase to Eirin. 

The next day, Eirin with the help of [[Reisen Udongein Inaba|Reisen]] broke the vase and released the sake bug into another container. The sake bug spewed sake, which was drunk by Eirin, Reisen, [[Kaguya Houraisan|Kaguya]] and [[Tewi Inaba|Tewi]].

==Relationships==
===[[Suika Ibuki]]===
Creator, Former owner
===[[Eirin Yagokoro]]===
New owner

==Additional Information==
===Trivia===
*A sake bug in mythology is a spirit from a Chinese myth, a sake spirit that dwells in humans. After ingesting it, humans can't get drunk. The spirit is also said to turn water into sake. It was written about in a Chinese novel and later adapted by Akutagawa Ryuunosuke's "The Wine Worm".
*There's no proof that Suika manages to get this specific Sake Bug back. It is most likely still owned by Eirin at Eientei.
*In chapter 16 of Wild and Horned Hermit, Kasen bring the same sake to the annual flower viewing ceremony, thanks to Yuugi's help. Reimu seems to recall it but forgotten about it.

{{nihongo|'''Saki Kurokoma'''|驪駒 早鬼|Kurokoma Saki}} is the extra boss of ''[[Wily Beast and Weakest Creature]]''. She runs the Keiga Family, a major organization of beast spirits in the Animal Realm of hell. 

==General Information==
Saki first appears as the extra boss of ''[[Wily Beast and Weakest Creature]]'' and is the leader of the wolf spirits. In terms of height, she is shorter than she looks, and she's mindful enough of this fact to always stand in an imposing manner, wings outstretched, to make herself look bigger.&lt;ref&gt;[[Strange Creators of Outer World/Who's Who of Humans &amp; Youkai in Gensokyo/Saki Kurokoma|Who's Who of Humans and Youkai in Gensokyo - Saki Kurokoma]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personality===
Saki has a casual (but not rude) personality. As the leader of the wolf spirits, she is as her underlings: strong physically but not very smart. She was quite pumped to fight the heroine. She also respects others' strength even if they are an enemy, like [[Keiki Haniyasushin]] or [[Yachie Kicchou]]. In ''[[Wily Beast and Weakest Creature]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;' &lt;/nowiki&gt;s Extra Stage, she even asks the heroines if they wanted to join them after being surprised at their strength or fight again. She is quite ambitious and does not hesitate to act, quickly planning on conquering hell and the surface when seeing a chance to.

===Abilities=== 
;Ability to have unmatched leg strength
While not directly stated, most of her spell cards seemingly correspond to her ability. Especially the "Agile Skill" spell cards.

==Character Design==
{{stub|section}}
===Origin===
Saki is based on ''Kai-no-Kurokoma'' ({{lang|ja|甲斐の黒駒}}, lit. Black-coated Horse from Kai), a legendary horse said to be owned and cherished by [[wikipedia:Prince_Shōtoku|Prince]] [[Toyosatomimi no Miko|Shoutoku]] that could fly through the sky. It was a horse that Shoutoku rode to various localities to spread the word of Buddhism. It was also said the Prince often rode this horse to Ikaruga (Hōryū-ji) and that the horse had miraculous powers on top of the ability to fly.

===Name===
Her full name is  {{nihongo|''Saki Kurokoma''|早鬼 驪駒}}. Her first name, {{nihongo|''Saki''|早鬼}}, roughly translates to "speed demon", which might be a reference to her ability. 
The {{lang|ja|鬼}} character also appears in the Japanese title of [[Wily Beast and Weakest Creature]] ({{lang|ja|'''鬼'''形獣}}).

Kurokoma is inspired by {{nihongo|''Kurokoma''|黒駒}}, a legendary horse owned by [[wikipedia:Prince_Shōtoku|Prince]] [[Toyosatomimi no Miko|Shoutoku]] said to be able to fly in the air, though the kanji used for her last name is different. First character means {{nihongo|''black horse''|驪|kuro}} and the second means {{nihongo|''horse''|駒|koma}}.

===Design===
Saki has red eyes and black hair. She has black wings and a black horse tail. Her outfit is reminiscent of cowboys, where she wears a brown cowboy hat, a light turquoise bandanna, and two diagonal-plaid patterned clothes, one light blue and the lower pale pink. She also wears brown boots.

==Appearances== 
[[File:Th17SakiSprite.png|frame|right|Saki's sprite in ''[[Wily Beast and Weakest Creature|WBaWC]]'']]
===Games=== 
;''Wily Beast and Weakest Creature'' 
She teamed up with the other groups to stage the Hell invasion to overthrow [[Keiki Haniyasushin]]. In the extra stage, she once again invades Hell after hearing of Keiki's defeat and plans to do the same to the surface world, this time to try and take them over for herself.

==Relationships==
;[[Yachie Kicchou]] and [[Keiki Haniyasushin]]
Saki gets along very poorly with both Yachie and Keiki, but respects their strength.

;[[Toyosatomimi no Miko]]
Given the legend that Saki was the horse of Prince Shoutoku, which is Toyosatomimi no Miko's former name, there is a high likelihood that the pair of them know each other, although this is not yet confirmed.

;[[Yuuma Toutetsu]]
Judging by the dialogue of the Extra Stages in the eagle spirit scenarios, it is suspected that Saki loathes Yuuma more so than Yachie and Keiki, saying that Toutetsu "is the worst".

&lt;br/&gt;

The matriarch of the Keiga Family.&lt;br&gt;
When word spread through the Animal Realm that the previously-invincible Keiki of the Primate Spirit Garden had been defeated, she made her next move in a flash.&lt;br&gt;
She thought that with Keiki out of the picture, it'd only be a matter of time before the Animal Realm fell under her own control, so she went to inspect the Human Realm in advance-- and take control of it too, if at all possible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

As soon as she thinks to do something, she does it without a second's hesitation.&lt;br&gt;
Because she values her underlings' opinions and achievements, among other reasons, she's one of the more popular organization heads. (Though all the work she does is unbelievably dirty.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

She likes strong people, even if they're an enemy.&lt;br&gt;
She gets along terribly with both Kicchou and Keiki, but she does respect their strength.

{{nihongo|'''Sakuya Izayoi'''|十六夜　咲夜|Izayoi Sakuya}} is the Chief [[Maid]] who serves [[Remilia Scarlet]], the head of the [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]]. She is the only [[human]] living in the Scarlet Devil Mansion.&lt;ref name="PMiSSSakuya"&gt;[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]: [[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Sakuya Izayoi|Sakuya Izayoi]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;『三月精 第2部』「上海アリス通信 三精版 第5号」（『月刊コンプエース』Vol.7 p.275。実質的には「第6号」なのだが誤植で「第5号」になっている。単行本未収録）&lt;/ref&gt;

==General Information==
Sakuya first appeared as the Stage 5 [[boss]] in ''[[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]]''. She appeared in ''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]'' as a playable character and in ''[[Imperishable Night]]'' as [[Remilia]]'s partner along with being in the new fighting game ''[[Immaterial and Missing Power]]''. Later, she appeared again as a playable character in ''[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]'', ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]'' and in ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]''. She was a playable character once again in ''[[Double Dealing Character]]'', and again in ''[[Unconnected Marketeers]]''.

She essentially takes the position of managing the Scarlet Devil Mansion. Her height is "tall"; she is taller than [[Reimu Hakurei]] and [[Alice Margatroid]] but about the same height as [[Yukari Yakumo]] and [[Hong Meiling]].&lt;ref name="email"&gt;[[ZUN's E-mails]]&lt;/ref&gt; She was not born in Gensokyo, and the name "Sakuya Izayoi" was given to her by Remilia Scarlet.&lt;ref name="email" /&gt; In ''Perfect Memento in Strict Sense'', Akyuu guessed that she might have originally been a [[#Vampire Hunter|vampire hunter]]. 

===Personality===
Sakuya tends to be a little spacey, but it's unknown if its just an act.  She's polite and pleasant towards to her mistress [[Remilia Scarlet]] and those she's close with, such as Patchouli Knowledge, while being less formal with other people. With those she's frequently annoyed with, such as [[Marisa Kirisame]], she can be somewhat harsh and direct with her insults and smack-talk, especially during duels. She seems to possess a wry wit and delivers comebacks stoically.

; In connection with her Age
As for her age, ZUN directly stated that "she plays the role of a human maid about 10 to 20 years old"&lt;ref&gt;[[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]]: {{lang|ja|おまけ}}.txt&lt;/ref&gt; and "perhaps she is a character in her early teens&lt;ref&gt;インターネットラジオ「萎えラジDNA コミケット72直前スペシャル」（2007年8月11日放送）でのZUNの発言&lt;/ref&gt;, and in ''Perfect Memento in Strict Sense'', according to Hieda no Akyuu, "she claims to be in her late teens", but acts with the mannerisms of someone  and the level of her ability seems like that of a human that's been living for more than a hundred years. According to a quote from [[Remilia Scarlet]] and Sakuya's ending in ''[[Imperishable Night]]'' (Good Ending #3), Sakuya has been working at the [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]] for so long, Remilia doesn't feel it fitting to call her human. With a comment like that, it seems safe enough to assume she has been at the Scarlet Devil Mansion for an extremely long time.

===Ability===

Sakuya possesses the ability to manipulate time, where she's able to control the flow of time, such as speeding up time, slowing it down, erasing it, and stopping time altogether. She can also compress the flow of time to make both past and future to exist at the same time, making the same object from different timelines be in many places simultaneously&lt;ref&gt;[[Imperishable_Night/Spell_Cards/Last_Word#Spell_Card_217|Imperishable Night - "Deflation World"]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[The_Grimoire_of_Marisa/Sakuya_Izayoi's_Spell_Cards|The Grimoire of Marisa - Sakuya Izayoi's Spell Cards]]&lt;/ref&gt;. The extent of her ability lets her not only control the time of the place in which she is, but influence the flow of time of a person, a specific object or even a small zone if she so desires, such as stopping the time of an object and thus affecting the space, making it stand still on thin air or creating time suspension fields where everything inside them will be affected by her ability; she can also accelerate or decelerate the movement of objects from slowed down speed to incredibly high speed, to even reaching the speed of light, making it move at tremendous speed. However, as it is difficult to reverse events that have already occurred, and since she is not able to return broken things to how they were originally even if she reversed time, in reality, it is not possible to reverse time.&lt;ref name="PMiSSSakuya"/&gt;&lt;ref name="k04-05"&gt;[[Curiosities of Lotus Asia]]: Chapter 4–5&lt;/ref&gt; However, she is able to do things to the extent of moving things back to where they were originally.&lt;ref name="PMiSSSakuya"/&gt; She has shown the ability to erase time of an object from a respective timeline; such as erasing bullets of the present and then the future, making them non-existent. &lt;ref&gt;[[Double Dealing Character]]&lt;/ref&gt;

She is also able to manipulate space,&lt;ref name="PMiSSSakuya"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GBB2"&gt;[[ZUN's reply to messages on the former Gensou Bulletin Board 2]]&lt;/ref&gt; and can narrow or lengthen it: she made the [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]], which was originally spacious, even more abundantly spacious, and furthermore just like this she cleans alone. [[ZUN]] also said that "Manipulation of Time" is synonymous with "Manipulation of Space". By manipulating space-time, Sakuya is also capable of creating another Sakuya and making it appear in front of her, which will execute a different action to that of the original. This is apparently related to "another time" though it isn't explained thoroughly. &lt;ref name=''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]''&gt; "[[Touhou Hisoutensoku/Spell Cards/Sakuya Izayoi|Alternate Skill Cards - Time Paradox]]"&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'', the power to control time is a power that a [[human]] can possibly have, but isn't acquired just from just training. In the games, using this ability, she scatters an infinite quantity of knives. To disclose the secret of this trick, she stops time and assiduously collects the knives.

[[Hieda no Akyuu]] believes Sakuya has managed to live so long while still looking like a teenager by manipulating time. It's true that Sakuya can increase the speed at which something ages, such as making bamboo flowers bloom instantly in Marisa's A ending of ''[[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]]'', even though this would normally take sixty years. It seems safe enough to assume she can decelerate aging for a specific object, too.

===Occupation===
As the head [[maid]], she oversees all the [[Fairy Maid|fairy maid]]s as the only [[human]] maid. The other maids have many perks to their jobs and rarely choose to leave (even though they are not paid or given vacations); however, they are nearly useless and most of the work is done by Sakuya alone, which would be impossible if she didn't stop or slow time. She shops at the [[Human Village]], but she is cold toward other humans and has no friends there. However, ever since [[Remilia Scarlet]] was beaten by the heroine of ''[[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]]'', Sakuya has begun opening herself up more.

At the time of ''Embodiment of Scarlet Devil'', she merely worked at the Scarlet Devil Mansion in return for food. Continuing in ''Imperishable Night'', she did not worry at all about the clothing, food or housing and felt satisfied.&lt;ref name="th08_txt"&gt;[[Imperishable Night]]: {{lang|ja|キャラ設定}}.txt&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, she is utterly devoted to her mistress.&lt;ref name="th08_manual"/&gt; She's constantly seeking out new varieties of tea flavours for Remilia to try, as shown in several official works. For example, she mentions in ''[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]'' that with so many flowers around, she can make as much tea and as many pastries as she wants. (Flowers have often been used to provide flavouring for tea, especially in the past, and are still the basis of jasmine tea.)

===Possessions===
[[File:GoMIllus-Sakuya.jpg|thumb|192px|Sakuya placing her knives, as illustrated in ''[[The Grimoire of Marisa]]''.]]
She possesses a great amount of silver&lt;ref name="PMiSSSakuya"/&gt;&lt;ref name="th08_manual"&gt;[[Imperishable Night]]: Manual&lt;/ref&gt; throwing knives and is skilled at handling them, and with only her ability to manipulate time&lt;ref name="GBB1"&gt;[[ZUN's reply to messages on the former Gensou Bulletin Board 1]]&lt;/ref&gt;, she is skilled in conjuring knives from nowhere.&lt;ref name="PMiSSSakuya"/&gt;&lt;ref name="th07_manual"&gt;[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]: Manual&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="th075_txt"&gt;[[Immaterial and Missing Power]]: {{lang|ja|上海アリス通信}}.txt&lt;/ref&gt;

Her throwing range is said to be 20 [[wikipedia:Ken (architecture)|ken]] (about 36 meters or 39.8 yards) and has the accuracy such that she is able to strike an apple on the forehead of a [[fairy]]. A portion of her throwing-knife ability is within her cooking ability and therefore is very skilled at cooking as well.&lt;ref name="th07_manual"/&gt; She also is able to conjure knives in battle as [[danmaku]] as well. In the games, despite Sakuya showing to make knives appear mysteriously when time is stopped, her artwork in ''[[The Grimoire of Marisa]]'' shows that she's placing the knives physically.

==Backstory==
ZUN has stated in [[ZUN's E-mails|his e-mails]] that Sakuya is not her real name and that she is not from [[Gensokyo]]. According to her profile in ''[[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]]'', her power to control time distanced her from [[human]]s, and she eventually gave up trying to be friendly with them.

It is unknown how she came to work for the [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]].

==Character Design==
===Name===
Her full name is {{nihongo|''Sakuya Izayoi''|十六夜　咲夜}}, which was given to her by [[Remilia Scarlet]]. The characters for {{nihongo||十六夜|Izayoi}} literally means "Sixteenth night" (the night just after that of the full moon), and {{nihongo||咲夜|Sakuya}} literally means "Flowering night". The Japanese word for {{nihongo|"last night"|昨夜}} can also read as ''Sakuya'', which would point towards the night of the full moon. The word for {{nihongo|"night of the new moon"|朔夜}} can also read as ''Sakuya'', which is possibly related to the ability to manipulate time. The word {{nihongo||十六夜|Izayoi}} has come to mean "sixteenth night" from the expression {{nihongo|"izayou tsuki"|いざよう月}}, where "izayou" means "not to progress/proceed forward at all", which might have a deep connection to her ability as well.

===Design===
[[File:PMiSS sakuya.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Sakuya in ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]''.]]
Sakuya was first seen in ''[[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]]''. In this game, she was seen with bright red eyes, silver hair worn in long braids on both sides of her face with green bows at the ends and a white [[maid]] headband. She wears a pink/white and dark blue French maid's outfit with an apron, short sleeves and a green ribbon. She is also seen carrying three knives and the phrase "Red Magic" appears to be embroidered on her left sleeve.

Later in ''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]'', when choosing a player, Sakuya appears to have grey eyes, blue colored long sleeves and a red scarf. She also has red shoes and two knives, one blue and one red. However, her appearance in-game shows her having blue eyes. She's wearing such clothing because it was effectively winter during the game.

Her appearances in ''[[Immaterial and Missing Power]]'', ''[[Imperishable Night]]'' and ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]'' are very similar. Sakuya is seen with grey eyes and once again wearing short sleeves. She appears to the have a thin black ribbon on the maids outfit. However in ''Imperishable Night'' she holds a knife and an old stopwatch, where as in ''Scarlet Weather Rhapsody'', she has three knives and a plate with cups and a teapot on it. The colour of her eyes changes with each work.

In ''[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]'', she has dark blue eyes and long sleeves. The Roman numerals for I (1) through XII (12) line the bottom of her apron. 

In ''[[Double Dealing Character]]'' and ''[[Unconnected Marketeers]]'' she additionally wears stockings.

; Alternative Outfits
Her alternative outfit in ''[[Immaterial and Missing Power]]'' and ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]'' is mainly light blue with a white apron and her hair is light green. In ''[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]'', her outfit is mainly dark red instead of dark blue.

==Theories==
{{Theories Summary}} [[Hieda no Akyuu]] states there are several theories regarding Sakuya's origins and/or behaviour (including she is a homunculus, a zombie, or an [[wikipedia:Eccentricity (behavior)|eccentric]]).&lt;ref name="PMiSSSakuya" /&gt;

===Sakuya's Species===
[[ZUN's E-mails]] has referred to her as [[human]], as do most of her official profiles. In ''Perfect Memento in Strict Sense'', [[Hieda no Akyuu]] considers Sakuya as a human, but wonders if she is not actually from Gensokyo, but perhaps one of many other worlds including Higan, the Netherworld, the Lunar Capital, and the outside world. [[Reimu Hakurei]] questions her humanity in ''[[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]]'', but throughout the series Sakuya insists and refers to herself as a [[human]] very often. ''Perfect Memento in Strict Sense'' states her ability to control time is an extremely powerful ability for a human to possess. 

===In relation to Sakuya's eyes being red===
In ''[[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]]'', and possibly ''[[Immaterial and Missing Power]]'' and ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s [[spell card]]s, there are parts when her eyes become red when using a spellcard. In ''Embodiment of Scarlet Devil'', it may possibly be due to the Scarlet Mist Incident, but it was inferred that those were to manipulate the eyes of insanity. In ''Imperishable Night'', at the scene where [[Remilia Scarlet]] worried that Sakuya might become insane at the time Kaguya cast the light of the true full moon, even when Sakuya looked at the true full moon there did not seem to be any abnormality caused by the full moon. However, ''[[Imperishable Night]]'''s Good Ending #3 indicates Sakuya went a bit mad. Additionally, ZUN [http://www16.big.or.jp/~zun/pic/top/top040830.jpg drew Sakuya with red eyes] shortly after the release of IN, and [http://web.archive.org/web/20040905235851/http://www16.big.or.jp/~zun/cgi-bin/bbs/minibbs.cgi answered a fan's question] about her red eyes in the picture, stating that they should play through the game to understand. The implication here is that Sakuya did indeed go mad. That being said, [[Reimu Hakurei]] and [[Marisa Kirisame]] passed through seeing the moon just fine, although they had their own reasons as to why they don't become insane. Either way, Sakuya acts completely normal anyway after IN.

===Vampire Hunter===
Sakuya being a vampire hunter is a theory that's speculated by Akyuu, based on the fact that her [[wikipedia:Silver|silver]] knives are the same kind used to slay [[vampire]]s and other [[demon]]s. Silver is one of the prime weaknesses of vampires.

The theory that was said by Akyuu claims that long ago, a young vampire hunter was training herself, defeating smaller [[demon]]s in an unknown location, but never had the chance to fight a vampire. Confident in her abilities, she decided to set out on a journey to slay vampires and ended up at the [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]]. There she saw [[Remilia Scarlet]], who was surprisingly strong, and Remilia easily defeated her. However, Remilia wanted the girl's power for herself, so she spared her life and gave her a new name, which also gave her a completely opposite fate: Sakuya Izayoi. Sakuya then became the head [[maid]] of the Scarlet Devil Mansion before it was moved to [[Gensokyo]]. This may also have some relation to her species theory.

===Human Cuisine===
[[File:OSP15Sakuya.jpg|thumb|192px|Sakuya shown cooking in ''[[Oriental Sacred Place]]'' Chapter 15.]]
Sakuya's involvement in the [[human]] cuisine of the [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]] is pretty heavily implied. While Sakuya has never been shown preparing humans, it's stated that all other maids in the mansion are practically useless and Sakuya is the one who does all the work. This heavily implies that she is involved in cooking as well since it's one of the biggest duties in a household.

[[Flandre Scarlet]] confesses to [[Reimu Hakurei]] in ''Embodiment of Scarlet Devil'' that she has no idea who prepares her human food, but doesn't think it's Remilia. Her profile confirms the pastries she eats are made from humans, but doesn't say who prepares the pastries. 

[[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil/Translation/Afterword|Music comments]] in ''Embodiment of Scarlet Devil'' by [[ZUN]] state that Remilia's tea is blood. In ''[[Strange and Bright Nature Deity]]'', Sakuya asked Remilia if she thought her latest (not humans) tea tasted like blood. Also, Sakuya's ending in ''Immaterial and Missing Power'' mentions that tea time is usually "red tea".

In [[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]], its stated that the Vampire Incident resulted in a contract where the Vampires(Remilia) were to be offered humans to feed on in exchange for their peace.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Vampire]]''&lt;/ref&gt;


In ''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'' Chapter 11, Sakuya comments at the flower viewing party, "It's been a while since I've seen such seedy-looking food. I usually see steaks dripping with blood."

In chapter 35 of ''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'', faced with Reimu's accusation that she's the one behind the sudden disappearances of the Human Village people because of Remilia's need for blood, Sakuya jokes that it didn't occur to her to kidnap people that way and then denies her involvement in the case on the basis that the kidnapped people come back unharmed the next day with no recollection of what they were doing during that time, stating that her time manipulation powers cannot stop the flow of time for people other than herself.

===Literature===
;''[[Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red]]''
:''Main article: [[Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red/Sakuya]]''
[[File:WaHHSakuya.png|thumb|170px|Sakuya as seen in [[Wild and Horned Hermit]] chapter 21]]
The article reports of Sakuya sneaking into [[Marisa Kirisame]]'s house and stealing various objects with the intent of building a rocketship to travel to the [[moon]]. Sakuya explains her odd behavior by claiming she is only carrying out Remilia's request.

In the interview, [[Aya Shameimaru]] asks to speak to Remilia to find out why she wanted those items, but in stalling Sakuya, she is late in delivering tea to [[Patchouli Knowledge]], who arrives to see what the hold-up is. Patchouli explains that they were going to use the items for a magic spell which would send them to the moon, but it ultimately proved useless in the end. The interview ends with Sakuya inviting Aya to join them for tea-time.

;''[[Silent Sinner in Blue]]''
Sakuya is ordered by Patchouli to gather information on how to construct a "[[Wikipedia:Saturn_V|Saturn V Rocket]]" that would be able to bring Remilia to go to the Moon. After receiving information from [[Rinnosuke Morichika]] on its construction, she visited the [[Hakurei Shrine]] to convince [[Reimu Hakurei]] to help "fuel" the "rocket" by lending a God's strength.  

Sakuya joins Reimu, [[Marisa Kirisame]], and Remilia in their adventure to the moon, where she is the first to fight (and lose) against [[Watatsuki no Yorihime]].

;''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]''
Remilia reacts to Reimu's new event of ''Mamemaki for Setsubun'' (an event where people throw beans to drive away the [[oni]]s) and decides to make her own festival without the beanthrowing in which Sakuya aids with the preparation. Kasen learns that the vampire is also weak against beans and decides to pay them a visit in which Sakuya kindly welcomes her and tell her about the festival.  After Reimu's change of mind, the Scarlet Devil Mansion cancels its own festival and sets up a sushi stand at the [[Hakurei Shrine]].

;''[[Forbidden Scrollery]]''
Sakuya goes to the Hakurei Shrine looking for Remilia's new pet, a supposed Tupai, which seems to have disappeared. Later, she goes along with Reimu to [[Suzunaan]] to research about the creature. After Hieda manages to capture it and reveal it was actually a Chupacabra, Sakuya returns it to the [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]].

;''[[Foul Detective Satori]]''
Sakuya is taken possessed by [[Mizuchi Miyadeguchi]] who used her in order to send [[Patchouli Knowledge]] in to a coma. [[Rin Kaenbyou]] and all Scarlet Devil Mansion residents suspected Sakuya as the culprit, which caused them to lock Sakuya in to the basement with [[Flandre Scarlet]], however, Flandre eventually let her out of the basement by destroying the lock on the door. Sakuya went to do the dishes immediately after being let out, at the same time however, [[Hong Meiling]] was put in to a coma by Mizuchi, which naturally caused everyone to suspect Sakuya again. Seeing as the investigation is not moving forward, Rin calls her master [[Satori Komeji]] to take over. She finds out that it was indeed Sakuya who caused Patchouli to fall in to a coma due to being possessed by Mizuchi.

==Relationships==
As a playable character in several games, Sakuya has met a large number of characters. Generally, she treats everyone with professional politeness fitting of a perfect and elegant [[maid]], but youkai that get in her way while she is resolving incidents are coldly exterminated.

===Residents of the Scarlet Devil Mansion===
Sakuya is loyal to [[Remilia Scarlet]] and serves her as the Head [[Maid]] without question, a servitude in which no one knows why either trust each other so much. She follows Remilia's requests even when she knows it won't work, such as catching [[Lily White]] to restore Spring in ''[[Strange and Bright Nature Deity]]'', as requested by her mistress. When Remilia playfully criticizes Sakuya for her failure to catch spring, she takes it in good stride and doesn't disagree. She will also do things for Remilia which she won't even ask, like accompanying her in ''[[Imperishable Night]]'' and ''[[Immaterial and Missing Power]]'' (or trying to, in the latter case), or putting on a sleight-of-hand magic show for Remilia without warning in ''[[Curiosities of Lotus Asia]]''. Remilia has said that Sakuya is an excellent cleaner, though not before contrarily stating that humans are useless. On occasion, she's more a babysitter than a maid. She chastises Remilia in her ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]'' and ''Immaterial and Missing Power'' victory quotes for sneaking out food or playing around too much.

[[Hong Meiling]] is a fellow employee who she pesters about her work productivity as shown in ''[[Immaterial and Missing Power]]'' and ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]'' victory quotes. Meiling seems easily frightened when Sakuya shows even a slight bit of anger as shown in ''[[Strange and Bright Nature Deity]]''. However, in Meiling's ''Touhou Hisoutensoku'' ending, when Meiling is found passed out and asleep, Sakuya takes Meiling inside because she is worried Meiling will get heatstroke.

She also serves [[Patchouli Knowledge]] since Patchouli rarely leaves her room. Sakuya has the highest authority as chief maid&lt;ref name="PMiSSSakuya" /&gt;, yet Patchouli's rank is noticeably higher within the Scarlet Devil Mansion. Sakuya may also be serving her because Patchouli is Remilia's friend, though she does care for Patchouli personally. In ''[[Silent Sinner in Blue]]'', she takes a private moment to watch and smile at Patchouli, who's blissfully unaware as she's researching a new magical breakthrough.

[[Koakuma]] is simply a fellow employee of the [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]] and presumably nothing more.

On top of serving Remilia, she serves her younger sister [[Flandre Scarlet]], who usually stays in the [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]] due to her lack of control over her strength. Someone prepares Flandre's food, which are [[human]]s prepared in the shape of pastries and other pleasant things, and although not directly stated, it has to be Sakuya.

As the head maid, Sakuya has precedence over all the other [[Fairy Maid]]s of the [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]]. She is familiar with every each one and notices any abnormality such as the [[Three Fairies of Light]] dressing up as three [[maid]]s. Due to the poor work productivity of the fairies, Sakuya presumably does most of the work. An advertisement in ''[[Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red]]'' states that Sakuya interviews for recruiting, so she may have interviewed the majority (if not every) of fairy maids herself.

===Marisa Kirisame===
Despite [[Marisa Kirisame]]'s tendency to "borrow" books from the library, Sakuya has shown on a few occasions (mainly endings) to be quite friendly with Marisa, going so far as to serve her snacks and tea and hiding her from Patchouli. This may explain Patchouli's low "catness" rating in ''[[Immaterial and Missing Power]]''.

===Residents of [[Eientei]]===
From the events of ''[[Imperishable Night]]'', Sakuya is one of the few people who know that [[Eirin Yagokoro]] and [[Kaguya Houraisan]] are from the [[moon]], and presumably keeping it a secret. Eirin's profile states Eirin is surprised to see Sakuya, but only Eirin knows why.

ZUN's only hint in regards to this can be seen above in the section about [[Sakuya_Izayoi#Sakuya's_Species|Konohana-Sakuyahime]].

===Minor Relationships===
;[[Three Fairies of Light]]
Sakuya met them in an omake in ''[[Eastern and Little Nature Deity]]'', where she stops their prank by throwing some knives at them. In ''[[Strange and Bright Nature Deity]]'', at the mansion, she saw through their [[maid]] disguises but didn't say a word and let them stay. She eventually kicked them out (according to the fairies' conversation) or frightened them out by telling them if they don't work, they don't eat. Sakuya was smiling, so she may have been speaking as-a-matter-of-factly.{{Reference needed|Employees in the Scarlet Devil Mansion are paid with food}} Later, when they're spying on Sakuya and others at the [[Hakurei Shrine]], she sees them, revealing she can see through their abilities to hide themselves even though [[Reimu Hakurei]] and [[Marisa Kirisame]] cannot. She cheerfully invites them to join, but this only scares them into running away, which disappoints her.

;[[Alice Margatroid]]
In ''[[Immaterial and Missing Power]]'' she gets lost in the Forest of Magic and Alice escorts her out. Also, she fights Alice as a way to relieve stress on her break. In ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]'', Sakuya is ordered by Patchouli to kick Alice out. In both cases, Alice thought it was a poor reason. In comparison, [[Marisa Kirisame]] and [[Youmu Konpaku]] don't even get into trouble when caught intruding in the mansion (in fact, they usually get tea, instead)&lt;ref&gt;[[Cage in Lunatic Runagate/Seventh_Chapter|''Cage in Lunatic Runagate'' Chapter 7]]&lt;/ref&gt;.

;[[Cirno]]
Sakuya has trouble understanding why Cirno finds freezing frogs or flowers fun in ''[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]'', but at least came to understand [[Fairy|fairies]]' recklessness from watching Cirno fight in ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]''. Cirno does not want to be a fairy [[maid]].

==Additional Information==
*Despite helping rebuild the [[Hakurei Shrine]] later in ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]'', Sakuya casually ignores [[Reimu Hakurei]]'s donation requests for shrine upkeep in ''[[Immaterial and Missing Power]]'', saying she [[Irreligion|doesn't believe in gods]] anyway.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Immaterial and Missing Power]]'' [[Immaterial and Missing Power/Story/Sakuya's Scenario|Sakuya's Scenario]]: "Too bad. I don't believe in gods."&lt;/ref&gt; She also describes herself as being as an atheist when Reimu asks her about disappearances in the Human Village in [[Wild and Horned Hermit]].
*Some people note that Sakuya has stated that she is an "atheist" on multiple occasions, such as in [[Wild and Horned Hermit]], despite living in a land where Gods are literally real. However, within context, Sakuya simply seems to mean she does not believe that the Myriad Gods, who represent nature, are "divine" and worthy of worshipping.
*Her alternate colors in ''Immaterial and Missing Power'' and ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]'' might be a homage to [[Ruukoto]], the first [[maid]] of the [[Touhou Project]]. In ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]'' more alternate palettes were added, including a possible reference to [[wikipedia:List of Rozen Maiden characters#Suigintou|Suigintou]] and [[wikipedia:Dio Brando|Dio Brando]].
*Similar to most humans in Gensokyo, Sakuya seems to lack knowledge of basic scientific concepts (such as the concept of oxygen), as seen in both [[Silent Sinner in Blue]] and her route in [[Unconnected Marketeers]]. 
*Theoretically, Sakuya is the fifth character to serve as a [[maid]] in the ''[[Touhou Project]]''. The other maid characters are [[Ruukoto]], [[Mugetsu]], [[Yumeko]] and [[Alice Margatroid]]. However, due to the fact that Mugetsu is probably not a maid, Sakuya would be the fourth maid in the Touhou Project.
*Shibata Masahiro's manga series "[https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/manga.php?id=1648 Sarai]" seems to be a big inspiration for many of the characters from EoSD . Sarai is a manga about superpowered maids fighting youkai and monsters in a dystopian future. The series was published from 1997 to 2007 in Japan only.
**Sakuya's design resembles that of Flicker and Nudge from Sarai and all of them are maids. Sakuya resembles Nudge more appearance wise (with the exception of Eyeglasses) while Flicker uses Knives as a weapon just like Sakuya. [https://onsen.touhouwiki.net/wiki/File:Maids_Comparison.jpeg The comparison] between Sakuya, Nudge and Flicker.

5th stage boss. Plays the role of a human maid about 10 to 20 years old.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That power of hers distances her from the human race. She has given up trying to be friendly to ordinary people.&lt;br/&gt;
She does not care about honor or power; she thinks so long as it earns her dinner, being the Scarlet Devil Mansion's maid is fine.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
She is the chief of the Scarlet Devil Mansion's maids and cleaning staff, and always takes advantage of her ability to stop time when working.&lt;br/&gt;
(If she cleans when time is stopped, it won't raise dust.)&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Due to the nature of the mistress of the house, it is arguable whether she serves the role of maid or babysitter, but in any case, she is in charge of most of the affairs of the household.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Total of nine card attacks.

'''Sakuya Izayoi'''&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The elegant maid of a certain mansion. She possess the ability to manipulate time.&lt;br/&gt;
Sharp and able, she has no real weak points but can't eat hot (temperature) foods.&lt;br/&gt;
Since she wants her knife-throwing skills to be comparable to her cooking skills, Sakuya is incredibly good at cooking.&lt;br/&gt;
Her is currently addicted to creating Chinese delicacies using expensive ingredients.&lt;br/&gt;
In order to save money and the planet, she reuses knives she's already thrown.&lt;br/&gt;
If she were to run out of knives during a battle, she'd just stop time and pick them up again.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Throwing knives are her weapon. Deceitless sleight-of-hand is her specialty.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
In any case, she starts out with 4 bombs. It makes it easier to clear the game.&lt;br/&gt;
"Jack the Ripper" locks onto enemies at certain angles in front of you.&lt;br/&gt;
It has low power, but it's a very easy to use weapon.&lt;br/&gt;
On the other hand, all of the "Time Sign" weapons have very unusual movement.&lt;br/&gt;
"Misdirection" angles its shots in the direction you're moving. If you switch to "Power Direction" when it's angled, the shot direction will lock in its current position.&lt;br/&gt;
The bombs, "Perfect Square" and "Private Square" are both very weak, but they have the longest invincibility time in the game. Also, these are the only bombs that make you move faster when you use them.&lt;br/&gt;
The biggest distinguishing point is: enemy bullets stop during bombs, so the fact that you can graze them like this + the fact that they become bonus items when the bomb is finished (and normal point items then get the bonus item value) mean that the more you graze, the higher you will score with her weapons.

Mainly she possesses the ability to manipulate time.

She is a [[maid]] who works at the [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]] on the banks of a lake in [[Gensokyo]] for no salary.&lt;br /&gt;

She's kept quite busy in this mansion cleaning, commanding the other maids, cooking, and taking care of her mistress.

The mansion is unnecessarily large and has monotonous colors, so it's hard to tell things apart inside. Nobody would notice if an uninvited guest wandered inside and fell into a hole somewhere, undiscovered. Nobody would know if they were discovered and gotten rid of, either.

Somehow, this scarlet building doesn't seem out of place surrounded by the green of Gensokyo. It simply stands there as if it were always meant to be there.

Living here, even Sakuya feels as if time has stopped. Of course, that's not because Sakuya has stopped time.

Ability: Ability to manipulate time

A [[maid]] who works and lives in the Scarlet Devil Mansion . She does a maid's duty perfectly: cooking, cleaning, washing, babysitting, knife throwing, etc. Her position is chief maid.

Her personality seems perfect and elegant, but sometimes she shows a more spaced-out side. The reason she works so quickly is probably because she stops time to do it, though ...

She also specializes in melee attacks. Probably even more so than at suspicious tricks like danmaku.
This is why she uses throwing knives in her danmaku. In addition, she likes magic that doesn't have tricks to it, so she proactively adopts it into battle. I can't help feeling this point is the odd acts.&lt;br /&gt;

A [[maid]] who serves a devil.&lt;br /&gt;
She lives in [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]]. She can manipulate time.&lt;br /&gt;
She is the head maid of the Scarlet Devil Mansion, but due to her mistress's nature she's practically head of the household.&lt;br/&gt;
She is utterly devoted to her mistress, and she feels no shame in being a "servant";&lt;br/&gt;
on the contrary, she's so easy-going it feels nice to watch her.&lt;br/&gt;
Sometimes she's a little spacy, but it's hard to tell if she's serious or faking it.&lt;br/&gt;
In either case, she's a fairly serious person.

Her weapon is throwing knives. Since silver is hard to come by, she's looking for other materials to use, too.

Notes:&lt;br/&gt;
She's teamed up with Remilia this time.&lt;br/&gt;
She can only use focused movement when alone.&lt;br/&gt;
She has a very orthodox, straightforward shot, so she's easy to use.&lt;br/&gt;
Recommended for people who must get every item.

When you're a maid, you don't have to worry about clothing, food or housing, even when you live this deep in the mountains. She's human, but both humans and youkai don't look too well on her since she lives with devils. Still, some humans will overlook this, and she never has to worry about her living conditions. She can't imagine a life better than this.

Recently, she has obtained knives that will aim towards enemies by themselves.&lt;br/&gt;
Since this is much easier than throwing them herself, they're quite enjoyable.

Not long afterwards, rumors surfaced that youkai were acting rowdy at the [[Misty Lake]] near the Scarlet Devil Mansion.
Sakuya goes to fight to try out her new knives.

Works as the head maid of the Scarlet Devil Mansion. Her cool demeanor makes it hard to tell, but she's actually a bit of an airhead.

Mysterious cards were circulating in the streets.&lt;br&gt;
Lady Patchouli gained an extreme interest in the cards, and ordered her to collect every last one of them.&lt;br&gt;
The cards certainly were intriguing. Apparently, some of them even contained her mistress's magic power.&lt;br&gt;
However, her mistress was fit as a fiddle. Just what exactly could this mean...?

| text = 数少ない人間の中でも、人間離れした性格と能力の持ち主であるメイドです。彼女がナイフを使うのは、彼女よりの美学なんでしょう。勿論、時止め中に頭上からロードローラーを落としたりするのも良いんですが。&lt;br/&gt;
他の人間とつるんでいる事は少なく、人間からはどちらかというと悪魔の手先と思われていますが、本人もそれを演じている節があります。そんなところも、後の主人公っぽいと言えば、ぽいです。
| translation = Among humans who are already short in numbers, she's an extraordinary human maid with a special personality and ability. The reason she uses knives is probably just out of fashion, and since it's about fashion, she certainly won't mind dropping a road roller on top of someone's head.&lt;br/&gt;
She does hang out with other humans quite often, but other humans mostly see her as a demon's servant, while she does act like one from time to time. This kind of personality makes her like a deuteragonist, to some extent.

{{nihongo|'''Sanae Kochiya'''|東風谷　早苗|Kochiya Sanae}} is a [[human]], but is also a distant descendant of the [[god]]dess [[Suwako Moriya]]. Her role at the [[Moriya Shrine]] is similar to a [[shrine maiden]], but with her inherited power Sanae has also become a minor deity herself. Originally from the [[Outside World]], Sanae migrated to [[Gensokyo]] with the shrine and its two resident goddesses, [[Kanako Yasaka]] and [[Suwako Moriya]]. As a result, she is rather knowledgeable about the outside world and modern living, although her attempts to explain scientific concepts usually just confuse the locals. Her knowledge on things like the youkai of Gensokyo, on the other hand, seems a bit lacking for a shrine maiden.

==General Information==
Sanae was first introduced in ''[[Mountain of Faith]]'' as the stage 5 boss, reappeared as the extra stage midboss of ''[[Subterranean Animism]]'' and later became a playable character in ''[[Undefined Fantastic Object]]'', ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]'', ''[[Ten Desires]]'', ''[[Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom]]'' and ''[[Unconnected Marketeers]]''. She is a secondary character in the comic ''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]''.

===Personality===
Sanae is confident, energetic and dutiful, sometimes too much so, and tends to get carried away easily or have trouble thinking for herself. She also appears to be something of a geek, making references to popular culture and having knowledge of advanced scientific concepts. As someone who grew up in the [[Outside World]], much of [[Gensokyo]] seems strange and novel to her; she finds great fun in "exterminating" [[youkai]] and solving incidents. She also may have somewhat of a complex about herself as an incident resolver, thinking foes won't take her as seriously as the other experienced youkai exterminators. The simple fact that she is adjusting to life in [[Gensokyo]] makes her an extremely rare case.

===Abilities===
;Ability to cause miracles
Sanae is capable of invoking miracles through her godly heritage, and many of her [[spell card]]s are themed after miracles of various religions or odd events. It's mainly the manipulation of weather, and also seems to use it in prayers for rain. The "miracles" that she can invoke are not related to good or bad fortune – they are merely events that have a very low chance of occurring. Before invoking a miracle, she needs time to prepare it proportional to how unlikely the miracle is. Simple ones can be invoked with a single word, while the most complex can take days.

;Abilities as a shrine maiden
Sanae is a [[shrine maiden]], but of a different type to [[Reimu Hakurei]]. Like Reimu she is capable of summoning gods, granting her some of their powers; while she relies on this ability much more than Reimu, she is only capable of summoning her patrons: [[Kanako Yasaka]] and [[Suwako Moriya]].

===Occupation===
Sanae's occupation as a [[Wind Priestess]] means to be the priest to worship the god of wind. However, while causing miracles of wind and rain to come about through a secret technique with many secrets, since she herself is treated to the same level as [[god]]s, and has become one who gathers faith, she is also a living god. In ''[[Mountain of Faith]]'', just in front of [[Reimu Hakurei]], she said about herself, "I guess you could call me something like a [[Shrine Maiden]]", indicating that there's a chance that she's different from a Shrine Maiden, but in the works, she is fundamentally treated as a Shrine Maiden the same way Reimu is. Furthermore, since Sanae is a "god" while at the same time being a "[[human]]", even if she loses all her faith, she can continue to live as a human.

===Possessions===
;Gohei
Sanae carries a gohei, also known as a purification rod, with her on incidents. She mainly used it to perform incantations and act as a bludgeoning weapon.

==Character Design==
[[File:ThGKSanae.png|thumb|200px|Sanae, as illustrated in ''[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]]'']]
===Name===
Her full name is {{nihongo|''Sanae Kochiya''|東風谷　早苗}}. {{nihongo|''Sanae''|早苗}} can mean "rice seedling" or "early seedling", and {{nihongo|''Kochiya''|東風谷}} "eastern wind valley". The same "east" ({{lang|ja|東}}) appears in {{nihongo|Touhou|東方}}, and the same "wind" ({{lang|ja|風}}) in the title of {{nihongo|''[[Mountain of Faith]]''|風神録}}.

; Origin of her name 
Unusual amongst Touhou characters, both are real names used in modern Japan. Presumably Sanae's name is derived from the real world person {{nihongo|"Sanae Moriya"|守矢早苗}}, the 78th head of the Moriya family which claims descent from {{nihongo|the god Moreya|洩矢神|Moreyashin|"Moreya" is an archaic pronunciation of "Moriya"}}. This family were supposed to succeed one of the priests of the [[wikipedia:Suwa Taisha|Suwa Grand Shrine]], {{nihongo|Jin Choukan|神長官||"God Director"}}.

===Design===
In her first appearance in ''[[Mountain of Faith]]'' she wears a blue and white outfit similar to a [[shrine maiden]]'s, with the blue areas covered in light blue polka dots and stripes. She has long light green hair, and yellow eyes (green in ''[[Undefined Fantastic Object]]'' and ''[[Ten Desires]]'', blue in ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]'' portraits). In ''Mountain of Faith'', she wears a snake-shaped hair accessory wrapped around her hair on one side, and a blue headband with a frog's head on it&lt;ref&gt;''https://i.imgur.com/G52b2Dr.png''&lt;/ref&gt; (both probably meant to represent [[Kanako Yasaka]] and [[Suwako Moriya]]), however, in every subsequent appearance after MoF, she has instead worn a hair clip shaped like a frog's head. She carries a gohei with straight paper decorations as opposed to the typical gohei.

In ''[[Ten Desires]]'' her hair color is slightly paler, and she wears a shorter skirt with maroon-colored boots instead of aquamarine-colored shoes.

==Appearances==
;''Mountain of Faith''
[[File:Th10SanaeSprite.png|frame|Sanae's sprite in ''MoF'']]
When [[human]]s on the [[Outside World]] began losing their faith in her and [[Kanako Yasaka]], the shrine's actual deity, Kanako decided to move the shrine to [[Gensokyo]] where at least [[youkai]] might have faith in them. During the events of ''[[Mountain of Faith]]'' Sanae tried threatening the [[Hakurei Shrine]] in order to establish the [[Moriya Shrine]] as the dominant one, not realizing how powerful humans like [[Reimu Hakurei]] and [[Marisa Kirisame]] were. In response to the threats Sanae was defeated by the heroine followed shortly after by Kanako and [[Suwako Moriya]]'s defeat. However, the residents of the Moriya Shrine have since come to an understanding with their new neighbors and live in peace with the other residents of [[Youkai Mountain]].

Following the extra scenario as the player heads through the [[Moriya Shrine]] to look for the two goddesses, Sanae appears as the midboss of the [[stage]]. She believes that the traditional greetings in [[Gensokyo]] is by attacking with [[danmaku]] because you can't be trapped by common sense. She attacks the heroine with three [[spell card]]s, but was defeated. Specifically on Reimu/Suika's scenario, she returns stating that Kanako was creating a kappa industrial revolution by using the old [[Remains of Blazing Hell]]. She was unaware of the incident that occurred in the game, making Reimu unhappy.

;''Undefined Fantastic Object''
[[File:Th12SanaebackSprite.png|frame|left|Sanae's back sprite in ''UFO'']]
In each scenario of ''[[Undefined Fantastic Object]]'', Sanae is ordered with a different task. Depending on this, her secondary bullet will become a snake or a frog.  
:{{Main|Undefined Fantastic Object/Story/Sanae A's Scenario|l1=Sanae A Scenario}}
[[Kanako Yasaka]]'s task is to to train her own abilities by hunting [[Youkai]].
:{{Main|Undefined Fantastic Object/Story/Sanae B's Scenario|l1=Sanae B Scenario}}
[[Suwako Moriya]]'s task is to to find the [[Myouren Temple|Treasure Ship]].

;''Ten Desires''
:{{Main|Ten Desires/Story/Sanae's Scenario|l1=Ten Desires Story}}
Sanae notices the strange spirit at the [[Moriya Shrine]] in ''[[Ten Desires]]'' and knows what they are: [[Divine spirit|divine spirit]]s, born from [[human]]s due to powerful fears, desires and feelings. She takes the opportunity to gather the divine spirits, as it is the same as gathering faith from humans. She can't, however, figure out why all these divine spirits have appeared in the first place.

;''Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom''
:{{Main|Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom/Story/Sanae's Scenario|l1=Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom Story}}
The [[Wikipedia:Curiosity_(rover)|Curiosity Mars rover]] appears in Gensokyo, causing all life around it to become petrified and turn to stone when it gets too close. Left unchecked, Curiosity would eventually purge all life from Gensokyo. Kanako and Suwako send Sanae to investigate it, which eventually leads Sanae to outer space and to the [[Lunar Kingdom]], where she learns that Curiosity was sent to "purify" Gensokyo and make it inhabitable to the Lunarians, due to an external threat the Lunarians are facing. Sanae is forced to save the Lunarians, lest Curiosity continue its destructive path.

;''Unconnected Marketeers''
:{{Main|Unconnected Marketeers/Story/Sanae's Scenario|l1=Unconnected Marketeers Story}}
At the request of [[Kanako]], Sanae is sent to investigate the proliferation of Ability Cards on Youkai Mountain.

===Spin-offs===
;''Touhou Hisoutensoku''
:{{Main|Touhou Hisoutensoku/Translation/Sanae's Scenario|l1=Touhou Hisoutensoku Story}}
In ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]'', thinking that a gigantic robot appeared in [[Gensokyo]], Sanae is in pursuit of the giant figure, when she stumbles into a giant pit to the nuclear reactor run by [[Utsuho Reiuji]] and learns that [[Suwako Moriya]] is responsible for creating the "[[robot]]" figure, [[Hisoutensoku]].

;''Double Spoiler''
In ''[[Double Spoiler]]'', Sanae appeared as an Extra stage target, where she uses a few [[spell card]]s and had [[Aya Shameimaru]] and [[Hatate Himekaidou]] take photos of her and her [[danmaku]].

;''Hopeless Masquerade''
[[File:Th135Sanae.png|frame|Sanae in ''HM'']]
Sanae made a background cameo appearance in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'' on the [[Genbu Ravine]] and [[Youkai Tanuki Forest]] stage. She is seen standing next to [[Suwako Moriya]] waving her onusa.

;''Impossible Spell Card''
:{{Main|Impossible Spell Card#Story|l1=Impossible Spell Card: Story}}
After apparently reading the newspaper by the [[tengu]] about a mischief-making [[amanojaku]], she becomes one of the many strong [[youkai]] and [[human]]s to try and stop [[Seija Kijin]]. She uses [[spell card]]s that are considered impossible to dodge.
===Literature===
;''Wild and Horned Hermit''
Throughout the manga, Sanae and [[Reimu]] have a continuing rivalry for the popularity of their respective shrines, the [[Moriya Shrine]] and the [[Hakurei Shrine]], among the residents of the [[Human Village]] and the local youkai.

Early on, Sanae requests Reimu's help with her mission of improving the inefficient netherworld reactor powered by [[Okuu]]’s nuclear powers, as part of [[Kanako Yasaka]]'s overall plan to bring clean energy to Gensokyo. Sanae's plan was to start nuclear reactions using [[wikipedia:cold fusion|cold fusion]]&lt;ref&gt; Chapter 2 [[Wild and Horned Hermit]]&lt;/ref&gt;. For that, she needed Reimu's help to contact the metals god, ''Kanayamabiko no Mikoto'', to obtain a [[Wikipedia:Palladium|palladium]] alloy. After obtaining the palladium, Kanako and Sanae made a successful public demonstration of cold fusion, impressing the local residents of the [[Human Village]].

However, Sanae is also cooperative with Reimu, as it is showed in Chapter 23, where she takes care of the [[Hakurei Shrine]] while Reimu was busy being a fortune-teller. She also comes to check in on Reimu near the end of the manga when Reimu fell unconscious for an extended period of time.

==Relationships==
;[[Suwako Moriya]] &amp; [[Kanako Yasaka]]
Sanae serves as the [[shrine maiden]] of [[Kanako Yasaka]] and [[Suwako Moriya]], and moved with them to [[Gensokyo]]. Sanae is also Suwako's distant descendant. During the events of ''[[Mountain of Faith]]'', Kanako sends Sanae out to collect faith. Much like [[Yukari Yakumo]]'s use of [[Ran]] and [[Chen]], Sanae can summon Kanako and Suwako in her spell and skill cards in ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]''.

;[[Reimu Hakurei]]
Sanae appears to have a friendly relationship with Reimu Hakurei, as she has been seen visiting the [[Hakurei Shrine]] on numerous occasions, both in the [[Undefined Fantastic Object/Story/Prologue|Prologue]] of ''[[Undefined Fantastic Object]]'' and in ''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]''; Sanae is even tasked with minding the shrine while Reimu is training with [[Kasen Ibaraki]].

;[[Marisa Kirisame]]
Sanae frequently meets Marisa on her visits to the Hakurei Shrine, and they seem reasonably friendly.

==Additional Information==
*Sanae seems to have a relatively low alcohol tolerance compared to other characters. In one of the endings of ''[[Mountain of Faith]]'', she gets extremely nervous when informed of the constant drinking parties the [[tengu]] will hold, with the narrator commenting she'll just have to put up with it, and in ''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'' chapter 19, she's constantly distressed about being made to drink.
*In ''Mountain of Faith'', her [[spell card]] ''[[Mountain of Faith/Spell Cards/Stage 5#Spell Card 66|Sea Opening "The Day the Sea Split"]]'' is extremely similar to [[Alice Margatroid]]'s second attack in ''[[Mystic Square]]'''s Extra Stage.
*Sanae's Spell card [https://youtu.be/MKpHnTdLt-0&amp;t=58 "Sea Opening Moses's Miracle"] in ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]'' strongly resembles [[wikipedia:Akuma (Street Fighter)|Shin Akuma]]'s [https://youtu.be/YaXUwGK7tnw&amp;t=60 "Misogi"] from ''Capcom vs. SNK''.
*In her last stage of ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]'', despite the fact that Sanae is fighting against [[Suwako Moriya]], Sanae can still use skills summoning Suwako to her aid (e.g. Using ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku/Spell Cards/Sanae Kochiya#Skill Card 8|Summon Earth's God: Metal Ring]]''), to attack Suwako.
*In ''Touhou Hisoutensoku'' Sanae's character portrait shows her having blue eyes, but her sprite has yellow eyes.
*Also in ''Touhou Hisoutensoku'', Sanae has alternate colors that resemble [[Rumia]]'s, [[Fujiwara no Mokou]]'s and [[Mystia Lorelei]]'s outfits. Conversely, one of Reimu's alternate colors resembles Sanae.
*Sanae appears in a promotional flyer wearing a school uniform.
*When in ''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'' a conversation occurred about a "electric rat", a thought bubble showed up with a censored Pikachu from ''[[Wikipedia:Pokémon|Pokémon]]''.
*Sanae's absences in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'' and ''[[Double Dealing Character]]'' were not anticipated by fans, in spite of her many appearances in previous games and manga: ''[[Undefined Fantastic Object]]'', ''Touhou Hisoutensoku'', ''[[Ten Desires]]'' and ''Wild and Horned Hermit''. [[ZUN]] directly stated that he hasn't included the [[Moriya Shrine]] cast in recent games without reason.&lt;ref name="ZUNAWA"&gt;[[ZUN's AWA Q&amp;A Panel]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, there'd be explanatory descriptions about the absences through official works:
*Sanae complains that [[Kanako Yasaka]] (or possibly them) not taking action in those two incidents in ''Wild and Horned Hermit'' chapter 19. Kanako replies kindly that she must calm down, and in another scene, tells her the settlement of negotiation with the [[tengu]] about the installation of an aerial tramway; she remarks that she or they've been always busy for completing it. Along with Sanae also knowing the negotiation has been very long, it should be implied that Kanako stopped Sanae from taking action on the incidents for some reason: for example, because Kanako wanted to concentrate her mind on the negotiation, because Kanako couldn't find it worth doing to take action in the incidents, or something else.
**To add the reason of her absence of ''Double Dealing Character'', Marisa points out to Sanae, in ''Wild and Horned Hermit'' chapter 19, that Sanae hasn't used [[Wikipedia:Ōnusa|her tool]] regularly; in other words, it isn't so well-used as to build its own ego and to get in rampage.
*Her sigil resembles the Star of David from [[Wikipedia:Judaism|Judaism]].
*According to Kanako in ''Symposium of Post-Mysticism'', Sanae hails from Lake Suwa of Shinano Province.

　　Kotiya Sanae

　　種族：人間&lt;br /&gt;
　　職業：風祝&lt;br /&gt;
　　能力：奇跡を起こす程度の能力

　　一子相伝の秘術を持つ人間である。&lt;br /&gt;
　　性格はいたって真面目で、自分の力に自信を持っている。時には過信しすぎる事もある。

　　元々は、風の神様を祀る人間だったらしいのだが、秘密の多い秘術で雨や風を降らす奇跡を起こしているうちに、周りの人間は秘術を行う人間自体を信仰するようになっていった。

　　つまり、風の神様が起こしていた奇跡を、いつの間にか人間が起こしていると勘違いし始めたのだ。

　　それにより、彼女ら秘術を扱う人間は人間でありながら信仰を集め、神と同等の扱いを受けるようになった。現人神である。

　　早苗は幼い頃から、口伝でしか伝えられていない奇跡を呼ぶ秘術をマスターしていた。子供でありながら奇跡を呼ぶ彼女は、多くの信仰を集められる――筈であった。

　　しかし、外の世界は大きく様変わりしていた。神徳の多い神様でさえ信仰する人間が激減していた。当然、人間でありながら神となった現&lt;人神など、信仰する人間は殆ど存在しなかったのだ。


　　早苗は別に信仰がなくても、普通の人間として生活できるから問題はなかったのだが、早苗が祀っている神様、神奈子はそうはいかなかった。

　　神様は信仰を失うと力も失う。神徳も出せなくなる。&lt;br /&gt;
　　それは神の死に等しい。

　　神奈子は決断した。人間から信仰を集めるには限界がある。これからは妖怪の信仰を集める事も考えないといけない、と。

　　早苗はその具体的な計画を聞き驚いた。我が国には昔から『幻想郷』という世界があった。その世界は今でもひっそりと存在しているのだという。幻想郷では外の世界で失われた（幻想になった）物が集まる。&lt;br /&gt;
　　つまり神への信仰も、幻想郷に移りつつあると考えられる。&lt;br /&gt;
　　そこで神奈子は、幻想郷に神社ごと移動すると言うのである。人間の世界との決別であった。


　　人間の世界との別れは恐怖であったが、それ以上に奇跡を起こす力を持っていた彼女にとって、奇跡の世界へ行く事は楽しみであった。

　　彼女は幻想郷の人間を正直なめていた。唯一の博麗神社を脅せば幻想郷自体、自分達の思い通りになると考えていたのである。彼女は霊夢に脅しを入れに行き、そして今回のように逆に痛い目にあってしまったのだ。

　　幻想郷に住む人間は、彼女が思う以上に厄介であり、そして力を持っている事を彼女は思い知らされた。

　　ここでは、彼女は特別な存在ではない。現人神なんかではなく、ただの人間となっている事に気付いたのだ。&lt;br /&gt;
　　これからは幻想郷の人間として普通に生きていくしかないのである。

&lt;br /&gt;
'''Sanae Kochiya'''

Species: [[Human]]&lt;br /&gt;
Occupation: [[Wind Priestess]]&lt;br /&gt;
Ability: Causing miracles

A human who possesses the knowledge of a secretly inherited art.&lt;br /&gt;
She has a very straightforward personality, so she has a lot of confidence in her own abilities.&lt;br /&gt;
Sometimes, perhaps a bit too much confidence.

Wind Priestesses were originally a devotees of the wind god, but as they used their secret abilities to create miracles such as summoning the wind and rain, the people around them began to believe in these humans with mysterious abilities.

In short, over time, people began to mistake the miracles caused by the wind god as being caused by them.

In addition, as keepers of secrets, they began to accrue faith and be treated as gods, even though they were humans. They became living gods.

When she was young, Sanae had mastered the secrets to call upon miracles that had been passed down through an oral tradition only. A young girl that could call upon the power of miracles would certainly collect great amounts of faith --- one would expect.

However, the outside world had changed a great deal. Faith in even gods with many divine virtues had been decreasing rapidly. There were few who would worship even a living god who had attained divinity during their life as a human.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Though she didn't really have much faith, Sanae was able to live as a normal human without any real problems, but this would not do for the god she worshiped, [[Kanako Yasaka|Kanako]].

When people lose faith in gods, the gods lose their power. They can't manifest their divine virtues. This is the same as death, for a god.

Kanako came to a decision. There were limits to the amount of faith that could come from humans. From now on, she would have to also look to youkai as a source of her faith.

Sanae was surprised to hear the details of her plan: a world called "[[Gensokyo]]" has existed within our nation since time immemorial. It is said that this world still exists, hidden.
Gensokyo has collected a number of things that have become lost - or, become fantasy - in the outside world. One could say that even people's faith in gods is in the process of moving to Gensokyo.&lt;br /&gt;
And so, Kanako decided to move her [[Moriya Shrine|shrine]] into Gensokyo. She would say farewell to the world of humans.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Sanae was afraid of leaving the world of humans, but as a person with the power to call on miracles, going to a world of miracles was one of the fun parts.

She did not take the humans of Gensokyo seriously. She thought that if they threatened the only shrine in Gensokyo, the [[Hakurei Shrine]], Gensokyo itself would submit to their every wish. She went to deliver her ominous message to Reimu, and then was in turn defeated.

The humans who lived in Gensokyo were more troublesome than she'd imagined, and in time she learned of the power they held, as well.

Here, she was nothing special.&lt;br /&gt;
She realized she had gone from being a god incarnate to just a normal human being.&lt;br /&gt;
All she could do now was to live a normal, peaceful life as a human of Gensokyo.

Species: [[Human]]&lt;br /&gt;
Ability: Causing miracles

The [[Shrine Maiden]] living in [[Moriya Shrine]] in [[Youkai Mountain]]. She is not used to youkai hunting.

She wishes to talk to humans more, because she lives with gods and youkai, but most of humans living around the foot of the mountain are youkai-like humans. She is worried about becoming like them. As may be expected of a living god, she is as strong as youkai, but she is also somewhat of an airhead.

She tries to do something like youkai hunting on [[Kanako Yasaka|Kanako]]'s recommendation, and... she makes an effort to get used to [[Gensokyo]].

　　東風谷　早苗（こちや　さなえ）

　　幻想郷に来てから早二年経とうとしていた。&lt;br /&gt;
初めは異形なる者に対して畏怖から、まともに儀式も行えなかったが、今ではすっかり馴染み、違和感なく通常の仕事を行う事が出来た。

もう、多少の事では驚かないと思っていた。&lt;br /&gt;
勿論、そう思ってしまったら必ず驚かされるのが幻想郷である。&lt;br /&gt;
そこが外の世界にはない幻想郷の長所であった。

彼女は、守矢神社から見える巨大な人影を見ていた。&lt;br /&gt;
人影は神社よりも遥かにでかい、彼女にとっての古典的な表現では十階建ての高層ビル位はあるだろうか。

その人影は、彼女には昔アニメで見た巨大人型ロボットに見えた。

しかし、ロボットと言うには動きが滑らかすぎた。&lt;br /&gt;
まるで生きているかの様に動く人影は、時には山に望み、時には里を睨みそして突然霧に包まれたあと、不気味なほど静かに消えた。

その事を神奈子に報告すると、それは「ブロッケンの妖怪」だと教えてくれた。&lt;br /&gt;
ブロッケンの妖怪とは、自分の影が霧に映り巨人に見える気象現象である。

実際何らかの気象現象かなんかであろう、そう考えてしまう自分の思考回路が面白くなかった。&lt;br /&gt;
だから彼女は、あの影は里を襲う巨大ロボだと思う事にした。&lt;br /&gt;
そう考えると調査が楽しいからである。

そう、アレは決して霧に映った影などではない。&lt;br /&gt;
霧が出てきたのは人影が出た後だったし、何より、ここは何が起こってもおかしくない場所、幻想郷なのだから。

Sanae Kochiya

It had already been two years since she came to Gensokyo. At first, she was so frightened by the bizarre monsters that she simply couldn't perform the rituals of a shrine maiden, but now she had become familiar with them, and carried out her daily jobs without any discomfort.

She thought that she wouldn't be surprised by some things any more. Of course, thinking like that in Gensokyo ensures that you will be surprised. That is Gensokyo's strong point, not present in the outside world.

She saw the huge figure from the Moriya Shrine. The figure was far bigger than the shrine. She guessed that, to use a classical comparison, it was about as big as a ten-story building.

The figure seemed to her like a giant robot from some [[Wikipedia:Gundam|old anime]] she had watched.

But its movements were too smooth to be a robot's. The figure moved as if it were alive, occasionally overlooking the mountain, occasionally shooting a glare at the village. Then, it was suddenly shrouded in mist, and disappeared with an uncanny silence.

When she reported it to Kanako, she told her it was the [[Wikipedia:Brocken_spectre|"Brocken specter."]] The Brocken specter is a meteorological phenomenon caused by a reflection of your own shadow on mist that seems to the observer to be a giant.

In reality, be it a meteorological phenomenon or something else, thinking like that wasn't interesting. So she decided to think of that shadow as a giant robot attacking the village. Because that would make thinking about it more fun.

That's right, that definitely wasn't a shadow reflected in mist. After all, the mist hadn't appeared until after the figure was already there. More than anything, though, because this was a place where nothing was too strange to happen: Gensokyo.

The card merchants' activity was centered around the Youkai Mountain.&lt;br&gt;
One could theorize that the cards' manufacturer was somewhere nearby, no?&lt;br&gt;
Given their position on the mountain, the Moriya Shrine couldn't turn a blind eye to this.&lt;br&gt;
If they left the situation alone, they thought, then the Hakurei Shrine would get ahead of them again.

{{nihongo|'''Sannyo Komakusa'''|駒草 山如|Komakusa Sannyo}}, also known by the epithet {{nihongo|'''Komakusa-dayuu'''|駒草太夫|Komakusadayuu}}, is the Stage 3 midboss and [[Boss|boss]] in ''[[Unconnected Marketeers]]''.

==General Information==

===Personality===

In ''[[Unconnected Marketeers]]'', Sannyo has a gruff and curt personality, telling the protagonist to go away before they "spoil the taste of her tobacco." It stands out how angry she becomes after recognizing [[Sanae Kochiya]], telling her that she shouldn't be there and asking if she was now a "mountain cop". Her speaking style with the protagonist is informal and brash, matching [[Marisa Kirisame]] in sarcasm and tone when the two of them meet, in contrast to her silk robes and otherwise high-class appearance. 

===Abilities===
She has the ability to control people's minds with her tobacco smoke. She mainly uses it to calm down her gambling patrons and prevent the sort of frenzy that tends to break out in gambling dens. &lt;ref name="UMP"&gt; ''[[Unconnected Marketeers]]'' - Sannyo's Profile &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="LE30"&gt; ''[[Lotus Eaters]]'' - Chapter 30 &lt;/ref&gt;

Her tobacco is made from herbs on [[Youkai Mountain]].&lt;ref name="LE30"/&gt;

==Character Design ==
===Name===
Her surname, {{nihongo|''Komakusa''|駒草}}, is the Japanese word for [[wikipedia:Dicentra_peregrina|''Dicentra peregrina'']]. {{nihongo|''Koma''|駒}} in this context means "horse", owing to how the plant's shape resembles a horse's head, and {{nihongo|''kusa''|草}} means "grass" or "herb".

Her given name, {{nihongo|''Sannyo''|山如}}, is spelt with characters that mean "like a mountain". When written with the character {{nihongo|女}}, ''nyo'' can also mean "woman", making "mountain woman".

Her nickname is {{nihongo|''Komakusa-dayuu''|駒草太夫|Komakusadayuu}}: her surname with the suffix {{nihongo|''tayuu''|太夫}} applied to it. A ''tayuu'' is the highest rank amongst {{nihongo|''[[wikipedia:Oiran|oiran]]''|花魁}}, which were high-ranking courtesans in historical Japan. While still courtesans, the tayuu were more like matrons and did not necessarily sleep with customers as their juniors did.

===Design===
Sannyo has purple hair with a ponytail, a yellow bow and red eyes. She wears a dark red top, over it a red jacket with golden embellishments, and a multi-layered skirt in various shades from white to purple with further embellishments. She also wears sandals, a golden fan and a smoking pipe in the shape of a dragon.

Her style of dress implies high wealth. Her robes are elaborately embroidered or painted, and purple fabric has always been considered a symbol of status or power because of its expensive production, so in ancient Rome it was reserved only for senators and emperors. Moreover, according to her profile, she smokes only selected tobacco from Youkai Mountain. Combined with her nickname, her refined appearance could imply a past as a high-ranking courtesan. On the other hand, according to the omake, her name comes only from her style of dress.

==Appearances==

===Games===
[[File:Th18SannyoSprite.png|frame|right|Sannyo's sprite in ''[[Unconnected Marketeers|UM]]'']]
; ''Unconnected Marketeers''
Her first appearance was in Unconnected Marketeers. The protagonist met her outside of the ''Rainbow Dragon Cave'', which she explained is a mine containing the "power of dreams." She warned the protagonist against delving inside but nonetheless didn't seem to consider it her problem. The protagonist also had the option of buying cards from her, as with the other bosses.

===Literature===
; [[Lotus Eaters]]
In chapter 29, Mamizou goes to the Gambling Den by [[Aya Shameimaru]]’s recommendation to find the tobacco which has a calming effect even for the people around the smoker.
There, she is greeted by Sannyo, who offers her playing odds or evens. Even though Mamizou thought she encountered the trick, she loses everything at the end. Later, Sannyo explains more about her tobacco and about how worried she is about the humans that go there disguised, as they could be attacked by youkai and her den could be facing problems.

However, Mamizou had the idea of organizing games also in Geidontei, in the [[Human Village]], where only humans can participate, which made them stop going to Komakusa. 

==Relationships==
;[[Tengu]] &amp; [[Kappa]]
In ''[[Unconnected Marketeers]]'', she mentions that she runs a gambling den which is frequented by the [[tengu]] and [[kappa]] of [[Youkai Mountain]]. The gambling den appears in ''[[Lotus Eaters]]'', with a big amount of [[kappa]], [[yamawaro]], and [[tengu]] inside.

;[[Moriya Shrine]]
In ''[[Unconnected Marketeers]]'', she chides [[Sanae Kochiya]] for acting like a "mountain cop" and complains about the Moriya Shrine meddling in her affairs in general.

;[[Mamizou Futatsuiwa]]
Sannyo treats Mamizou with high respect, giving her a great greeting at her place in ''[[Lotus Eaters]]''. Later, she calls her a “distinguished youkais from the Youkai Mountain”, “Miss Futatsuiwa” or even “boss”.
They are seen talking in Geidontei, and they seem in really good terms.

==Additional Information==
*In the trial version of ''[[Unconnected Marketeers]]'', Sannyo's boss sprite and [https://en.touhouwiki.net/images/archive/f/fe/20210503160233%21Th18Dayuu.png spell card cutin] were both based on her defeated dialogue portrait, in which her sleeve and dress are visibly torn. This has been rectified in the full version.
*The name of Sannyo's species "yamajorou" is one of the aliases of "mountain woman" ({{lang|ja|山女}}, yama onna).
**On the other hand, it is also a nickname of a butterfly [[Wikipedia:Byasa_alcinous|"Byasa alcinous"]] ({{lang|ja|ジャコウアゲハ}}, jakou ageha). Look at [http://ishii1.fc2web.com/r-jyakouageha.html the photos (Caution: large photos of butterflies)], you should find its color is like a luxurious kimono of a mature high-ranked lady.

Full name: '''Sannyo Komakusa'''&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Nickname: Komakusa-dayuu&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Species: Yamajorou&lt;br /&gt;
Ability: Capable of controlling people's minds with tobacco smoke&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

A mountain youkai who enjoys tobacco. Lives on the high plateaus of the Youkai Mountain.&lt;br /&gt;
Other mountain youkai call her by the fond nickname "Komakusa-[[wikipedia:Oiran#Ranks|dayuu]]", owing to her appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

She runs a gambling den for tengu, yamawaro, kappa, and the like, and makes her living as its bookmaker.&lt;br /&gt;
For the mountain youkai, gambling is the highest form of amusement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

100% natural Youkai Mountain tobacco is known for the variety of effects it induces when its smoke is inhaled.&lt;br /&gt;
For instance, it can calm one's mind, or conversely invigorate it.&lt;br /&gt;
She skillfully uses this smoke to prevent the sort of frenzy that tends to break out in gambling dens.&lt;br /&gt;
The den she runs is a fine, gentlemanly social gathering spot. Thanks to the tobacco smoke that encircles everything in it, that is...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

The Ability Cards that suddenly sprang up would be the ultimate material for the mountain youkai to bet on.&lt;br /&gt;
That was what she thought.

{{nihongo|'''Sara'''|サラ}} is a being residing in the mountain cave that houses the gateway into [[Makai]]. During the events of ''[[Mystic Square]]'', Sara attempted to prevent the heroine from entering Makai, referring to [[Reimu Hakurei]] as "prey". Because she is officially the [[gatekeeper]] of the door to Makai, it was her job to keep the heroines out. However, she was easily defeated.

==Character Design==
===Name===
Her name is {{nihongo|''Sara''|サラ}}, which is named after Sara Brownie from [[wikipedia:Izumi Takemoto|Izumi Takemoto's]] story {{nihongo|The Crystal Egg|水晶の卵|Suishoo no tamago}} from the compilation {{nihongo||虹色♪爆発娘♥|Niji-iro♪Bakuhatsu Musume♥}}.

'''Sariel''' is an angel of death that [[Reimu Hakurei]] encounters deep within [[Makai]] in the Fallen Shrine in ''[[Highly Responsive to Prayers]]''. Sariel is the final enemy Reimu confronts there before returning to her shrine. But since Sariel has no profile and exchanges no dialogue with Reimu, nothing else is known about this angel. 

==Character Design==
===Name===
This character's name is Sariel, which means "Command of [[God]]". In Judaic and Islamic traditions, Sariel is the name of an archangel. However, some Judaic-Christian texts claim that Sariel is an Angel of Death, alongside Michael, Gabriel, and Samael. In other texts, Sariel is referred to as a ''fallen angel''. The Sariel in religon is always depicted as being male, so the Sariel in this game is ambiguous enough to belong to either gender.

In Coptic tradition, Sariel is thought to be the angel of the church of Sardis, referred to in The Revelation to John, and has an immense knowledge of magic, magic rituals, and magic powers that give him the ability to lead others astray. Fittingly, Sariel's second theme is called 'The Civilization of Magic".

===Design===
Seen in Sariel's sprite in ''[[Highly Responsive to Prayers]]'', this character is a ghost-like angelic figure with white knee-length hair with seemingly blue eyes. Sariel wears a long, simple blue dress with long white sleeves. Sariel has six angel wings and holds a strange wand. Sariel's six wings (if one looks closely) show that this character is possibly a seraph. (Seraphim are the highest order of angels in the Christian angelic hierarchy.) Sariel has another form.

In regards to Sariel's highly disputed gender, fans tend to portrait Sariel male, female, and/or in some cases, [[wikipedia:Androgyny|androgynous]]. Since Sariel's sprite is ambiguous enough, it obvious as to why fans tend to guess Sariel's gender. However, it should be noted, that in most (religious) tradition that angels in general are supernatural beings, thus having not any real important clear reason for specifically having a gender.

==Relationships==
===Minor Relationships===
;Shinki
[[Shinki]] is the creator of [[Makai]] and everything within it. In light of this, Shinki may also have created Sariel.

==Additional Information==
*Sariel's background changes throughout the battle: from a starry night, to a river with two floating yin-yang orbs, to what appears to be an inferno with human arms reaching out of the ground, and a collection of orbs showing Reimu and her shrine at another point in time.
*Sariel appeared in a silhouette in the second form, similar to the [[Windows]] game covers. This makes Sariel the first character in the whole series to appear in a silhouette.
*Sariel is the first character to have more than one theme.
*Sariel's sprite is based on the sprite of the final boss of "[[w:Tournament of the Gods|Tournament of the Gods II]]", a game by [[w:AliceSoft|AliceSoft]]. ([https://onsen.touhouwiki.net/wiki/File:Lookatit.png comparison])

{{nihongo|'''Satono Nishida'''|爾子田 里乃|Nishida Satono}} is a subordinate of [[Okina Matara]], along with her partner [[Mai Teireida]].

==General Information==
Satono appeared as the Stage 5 Midboss, Stage 5 Boss and Extra Stage Midboss in ''[[Hidden Star in Four Seasons]]''.

===Personality===
She has little memory of her time as a human, but has retained her personality. She is discreet, but tends to be overconfident. Still, she acts for Okina's sake alone, seemingly not having the free will to question otherwise. &lt;ref name="HSiFSP"&gt; ''[[Hidden Star in Four Seasons]]'' - Satono and Mai's Profile &lt;/ref&gt;

===Abilities===
;Drawing out people's mental energy by dancing behind them
Entrusted to Satono, it is not an ability of hers, but of her master, Okina. She draws out the latent ability in all things by dancing behind them, in this case mental energy.

===Occupation===
Satono, along with Mai, are douji to Okina Matara. &lt;ref name="HSiFSP"/&gt; Okina describes the job as a fixer, helping Okina maintaining the balance of Gensokyo from behind the scenes. Okina compared the job to being "her precious arms and legs." Okina also mentions that she swaps them out with new humans, periodically, implying that both of them are successors to previous douji Okina has had. &lt;ref&gt; ''[[Hidden Star in Four Seasons/Story/Marisa's Scenario|Hidden Star in Four Seasons]]'' - ''"Yes. They're my precious arms and legs, which is why I periodically swap them out for new humans."'' &lt;/ref&gt; According to Okina, a Nishida is in charge of spirit&lt;ref&gt;[[Hidden Star in Four Seasons/Story/Marisa's Extra|Hidden Star in Four Seasons Extra Stage]] — "So which one would you prefer to be? Teireida in charge of life energy, or '''Nishida in charge of mental energy?'''" - Okina&lt;/ref&gt;, which Satono currently occupies.

===Species===
She and Mai appear humanoid, but their species and Okina's extra dialogue indicates that the two currently aren't human.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hidden Star in Four Seasons/Story/Marisa's Extra|Hidden Star in Four Seasons Extra Stage]] — "If you take over, I intend to release them and make them human again. Although if you don't take the job, they'll remain as they are forever." - Okina&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character Design ==
===Origin===
{{Stub|section}}

===Name===
Her full name is {{nihongo|''Satono Nishida''|爾子田 里乃}}. The characters for {{nihongo|''Nishida''|爾子田}} mean, in order, the second person singular pronoun "you", "child" or "small", and "rice field". The character for "rice field" ({{lang|ja|田}}) is shared with the surname of her partner, [[Mai Teireida]]. Her given name, {{nihongo|''Satono''|里乃}} contains the character for "village", and an archaic form of the possessive particle ({{lang|ja|の}}). ''Nishida'' also has the same pronunciation as a common Japanese surname ({{lang|ja|西田}}).

===Design===
Similarly to Mai's design, she has light ginger hair, cut short with two long side locks, and purple eyes. She wears a Kazaori-eboshi, a smaller type of eboshi that has been folded. She wears a dotted magenta dress with short sleeves. Her sleeves have a black cuff and yellow lace. Her dress has a black high neck collar, connected to a white bertha collar tipped with yellow lace. She wears a rectangle white half apron fastened around her waist with the same yellow lace. There's a row of red buttons and bows across her bertha collar and her apron. She has black kneesocks and magenta shoes with short heels. She is shown to be holding a stalk of Myoga Ginger&lt;ref&gt;[[Strange Creators of Outer World/Who's Who of Humans &amp; Youkai in Gensokyo]] - [[Strange Creators of Outer World/Who's Who of Humans &amp; Youkai in Gensokyo/Satono Nishida and Mai Teireida|Satono Nishida and Mai Teireida]]&lt;/ref&gt; with her left hand. Mai's as well as Satono's design and pose is presumably based off the clothing and pose of the two servants of Matara-jin as seen in this woodblock print. Her color scheme directly contrasts with that of Mai.

==Appearances==
===Games===
;''Hidden Star in Four Seasons''
[[File:Th16SatonoSprite.png|frame|Satono's sprite in ''HSiFS'']]
Emerging alongside their master, Okina, she orders her subordinates to find others worthy of serving her. To do so, they plant doors on the backs of others and empower them, to bring out their best and test them. What they don't know, however, is that they aren't searching for allies, like Okina told them, but for their own replacements.

==Relationships==
;[[Okina Matara]]
Okina is Mai and Satono's master. They are vessels of her power, acting as extensions of her and unflinchingly obeying her orders. They are becoming less human due to Okina's influence. They have little memory of their past, yet maintain their personality. Whether because they're no longer useful or she pities them, Okina seeks to replace them, which she has periodically. However, after failing to find successors, Okina says she is fine with retaining them. Satono and Mai do not know they are even searching for their own replacements.
;[[Mai Teireida]]
Mai is a fellow subordinate under Okina.

Satono Nishida&lt;br /&gt;
Mai Teireida&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Species: Human (?)&lt;br /&gt;
Ability: Capable of drawing out people's mental energy by dancing behind them (Satono)&lt;br /&gt;
Ability: Capable of drawing out people's vitality by dancing behind them (Mai)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

A pair whose purpose is to draw out the latent abilities of all things. Okina's subordinates.&lt;br /&gt;
They used to be regular human children, but due to Okina's magic power, they're becoming less and less human.&lt;br /&gt;
They hardly have any memory of their time as humans, and they dance in joyful madness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

However, their personalities are the same as when they were human. Mai is a scatterbrain, but she's quick to take action.&lt;br /&gt;
Satono is discreet, but slightly overconfident at times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Their dances aren't meant for people to enjoy, and are in fact quite eccentric.&lt;br /&gt;
They dance all for Okina's sake, and take action all for Okina's sake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

The two of them don't know that the doors on people's backs are meant to search for their own successors.&lt;br /&gt;
Okina only told them that the doors are meant to search for more allies for the two of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

If they did happen to find out the truth, what action would they take?&lt;br /&gt;
In all likelihood, they'd just keep doing the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;
They can hardly even imagine going against Okina's orders, after all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

They serve Okina as her loyal servants, but their abilities, too, are nothing more than an extension of Okina's.

{{nihongo|'''Satori Komeiji'''|古明地　さとり|Komeiji Satori}} is the Mistress of the [[Palace of the Earth Spirits]] after the underground city was separated from Hell. Her ability to read minds causes various [[youkai]] and spirits to fear her, but makes her loved by the animals that normally can't be understood. With these animals as pets, she manages the ruins of the [[Hell of Blazing Fires]] where her home stands. She is also the main protagonist of ''[[Foul Detective Satori]]''.

==General Information==
She first appeared as Stage 4 Boss in ''[[Subterranean Animism]]'', then she was Stage 9 target in ''[[Double Spoiler]]''.

Satori Komeiji is, as her namesake suggests, a [[satori (species)|satori]], which means she has the power to read minds. The satori are particularly detested, even among the other youkai currently living in [[Former Hell]]. Her palace never gets visitors, because no one wants to visit her. Even [[Kanako Yasaka]] felt the need to go behind her back to get control of the [[Hell of Blazing Fires]], as it would be impossible to negotiate with her.

===Personality===
Not much is known about Satori's actual personality. When the heroine arrives at the Palace during the events of ''[[Subterranean Animism]]'', she is very suspicious, and decides to fight against her by using danmaku patterns in the heroine's own mind (or that of her partner). However, she appears to be loved by animals, as they can't normally be understood in the first place.

===Abilities===
;Reading minds
As a [[Satori (Species)|satori]], Satori is capable of reading the heart and mind of any living creature, even [[vengeful spirit|vengeful spirits]]. This ability works only on those within her immediate presence,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Subterranean Animism]]'': [[Subterranean Animism/Story/Reimu and Suika's Scenario|Reimu and Suika's Scenario]] - "(I knew it, she can't tell what I'm thinking up here. It's so far away, I'm in a safety zone.)"&lt;/ref&gt; and doesn't work at all on her sister, Koishi.

;Hypnotism
Satori has limited hypnotic abilities, allowing her to bring traumatic memories to the surface of a person's mind or induce amnesia&lt;ref&gt;''[[Double Spoiler]]'': Memory Sign "Brain Fingerprint" - "When there's a trace of fear deep in your heart, that's trauma.

==Backstory==
When the [[Yama]]s moved the actual site of [[Hell]] away from the [[Underground]], there were many [[vengeful spirit|vengeful spirits]] left over that needed to be controlled. The [[Palace of the Earth Spirits]] was built on top of the ruins of the Hell of Blazing Fires, and with Satori as the mistress of the palace, there was no chance of any kind of revolt. Eventually, Satori delegated various roles in the maintenance of the [[Hell of Blazing Fires]] to the many pets that had assembled in the palace.

===Name===
Her surname {{nihongo||古明地|Komeiji|lit. "ancient-bright earth"}} is an actual Japanese surname, seen mainly in the [[wikipedia:Yamanashi Prefecture|Yamanashi prefecture]]. The kanji {{lang|ja|地}} in Komeiji is also used in the Japanese title of ''[[Subterranean Animism]]'' ({{lang|ja|東方'''地'''霊殿}}). Her given name {{nihongo||さとり|Satori}} is homophonous with the name of her species, {{nihongo||覚|[[Satori (Species)|satori]]}}, but written in hiragana. "Satori" could also be interpreted as {{nihongo||悟り|satori|lit. "understanding" or "enlightenment"}}.
===Design===
Has short, purple hair with a black hairband and purple eyes. A red "third eye" is positioned over her heart, with cords running to her head and wrists. Wears a blue shirt with yellow heart buttons and pink collar, a pink skirt with faint flowery pattern and pink slippers.

[[File:Th11SatoriSprite.png|frame|Satori's sprite in ''SA'']]
At some point in the past she started living in the Palace of the Earth Spirits, right above the Hell of Blazing Fires. However, her ability caused her to be shunned by humans and most Youkai. Over time, the only other residents in the Palace were her pets, who welcomed Satori's ability to read minds. Due to the difficulties in managing the Hell of Blazing Fires, she started letting the pets do some of the work.
[[File:Th135Satori.png|frame|Satori in ''HM'']]
During the events of Stage 4 in [[Subterranean Animism]], the Heroine (from above ground) invaded her home. The Heroine inquired Satori about the evil spirits and the geyser that brought them above ground; suspicious, the Youkai read the Heroine's heart, only to find that the above-ground human does not care about such things. Thus, Satori decided to test their strength. After the encounter, she permitted the Heroine passage towards the Hell of Blazing Fires to ask her pets about their supposed problem.

;''[[Foul Detective Satori]]''
Satori is the main protagonist of the story. She sends out [[Rin Kaenbyou]] as her assistant to interrogate various people in an effort to find a [[Vengeful spirit]] that has escaped from [[Former Hell]], [[Mizuchi Miyadeguchi]] she prefers to stay in the Castle of the Earth Spirits and rely on Rin bringing her reports, however, she will also do investigations on her own when it's needed. In the first investigation, [[Patchouli Knowledge]] and [[Hong Meiling]] were put into a coma by [[Mizuchi Miyadeguchi]], she finds out that Mizuchi was able to move around in the Scarlet Devil Mansion by possessing [[Sakuya Izayoi]], who was not put into a coma due to being a human.

In the second investigation, [[Yuyuko Saigyouji]] was put into a coma by Mizuchi, who was possessing [[Marisa Kirisame]] and brought her sake.

After Yuyuko wakes up, she together with [[Youmu Konpaku]] and Satori head out and search for Marisa, discovering her at [[Alice Margatroid]]'s house, who was also now in a coma.
They subsequently tie Marisa up and interrogate her. They find out that [[Yukari Yakumo]] told her that Alice was in a coma, which is the reason why she went to her house.
Afterward, Satori and Rin return to the [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]] in order to ask [[Patchouli Knowledge]] about the scarlet mist incident, much to her shock however, Patchouli seems to have used some sort of magic spell that allowed her to read Satori's mind.

Having discovered that [[Mizuchi]] operates in the pattern of the incidents, she immediately sends Rin to [[Eientei]] to interrogate the residents there, after Rin brings her report back, Satori feels weak and collapses, this is supposedly due to her feeling ill when she reads too many human minds.
After Rin reports of an [[Marisa Kirisame|intruder]] at Eientei, she heads out there herself, however, on the way there she was found collapsed for yet unknown reasons in the Bamboo forest of the Lost by the earth rabbits, and was taken to Eientei in order for her to recover.

==Relationships==
;[[Rin Kaenbyou]] &amp; [[Utsuho Reiuji]]
Satori keeps many pets, including blaze cats and hell ravens, which also oversee the general management of the Hell of Blazing Fires. Chief amongst those pets are [[Rin Kaenbyou]], the blaze cat in charge of the evil spirits, and [[Utsuho Reiuji]], the hell raven who manages the depths of the Hell of Blazing Fires.
;[[Koishi Komeiji]]
The other important relationship for Satori is her sister, Koishi. Satori cares about Koishi, and wants her sister to open her heart to others once again.

==Additional Information==
*In ''Subterranean Animism'', with the exception of her first spell card, all of Satori's spell cards are based on, if not directly stolen from, those of the players' trauma of their partners.
*According to the ''[[The Grimoire of Marisa/Satori Komeiji's Spell Card|Grimoire of Marisa]]'', she can only read what the opponent is thinking ''currently''. Due to this limitation, she uses hypnosis in order to dig into their memories and recover their trauma.
*Satori is currently the first Touhou [[Windows]] character who appears before her subordinate is introduced.
*If her and Koishi's color schemes are inverted, they will both somewhat resemble each other.
*With seventy-six [[spell card]]s total in ''[[Subterranean Animism]]'' (one spell card of her own, plus three cards from one of the six player's partner, across four difficulties), Satori has more spell cards in a single title than any other character in the series. The only characters who come close are [[Okina Matara]], with forty-six cards total in ''[[Hidden Star in Four Seasons]]'' (five first Stage 6 cards, plus four for each season final cards, across four difficulties, plus ten cards from Extra Stage across one difficulty), [[Kaguya Houraisan]], with forty-one cards total in ''[[Imperishable Night]]'', and each of the [[Three Fairies of Light]] individually, with forty cards total each in ''[[Great Fairy Wars]]''.
*Satori's theme song is likely a reference to one of the background songs from the [[wikipedia:Neon Genesis Evangelion|Neon Genesis Evangelion]] anime, "She Said Don't Make Others Suffer For Your Personal Hatred". It shares the same phrase and progression in the chorus, as well as many other musical similarities with Satori's theme, and the piece of music is originally used during a battle with the angel [[wikipedia:Sahaquiel|Sahaqiuel]], a giant red eye floating in the sky with the ability to jam communications. This is also likely due to the highly psychological nature of Neon Genesis Evangelion.

Satori Komeiji

Race: [[Wikipedia:Satori_%28folklore%29|Satori]]&lt;br/&gt;
Ability: Reading minds

The master of the Palace of the Earth Spirits.

The underground city was separated from Hell, but a number of uncontrollable spirits remained in the former facilities of Hell, so there was a need to control them.

The Palace of the Earth Spirits is built above what was the Hell of Blazing Fires, and this is where she took up residence.
Since she can read others' minds, all sorts of youkai and spirits fear her, 
so eventually people stopped visiting the Palace of the Earth Spirits.

On the other hand, her power makes her well-loved by animals that don't speak, so eventually the premises began to overflow with many pets, starting with blaze cats and hell ravens.

Her great number of pets made it difficult to manage the Hell of Blazing Fires, so she entrusted parts of its management to some of her pets.

Her pets would oversee other pets.&lt;br/&gt;
Her pets would tend the gardens.&lt;br/&gt;
Her pets would play with her younger sister.

However, what shouldn't have happened did: a human came from above ground, and she was surprised when they started asking about vengeful spirits and a geyser.

Satori left Orin in charge of the vengeful spirits and Utsuho in charge of the Hell of Blazing Fires.
They were both loyal to Satori, so they shouldn't have done any harm.  She believed there was no way they'd start some sort of incident.

She thought that perhaps the human before her was spouting off lies and trying to trick her, so she read her heart and was surprised again by what she saw.

There was almost nothing to be seen inside the humans' mind about the vengeful spirits or the geysers.
Suspicious, Satori decided to test them.

{{nihongo|'''Seiga Kaku'''|霍 青娥|Kaku Seiga}} is a "wicked" [[hermit]] and the superior of [[Yoshika Miyako]]. She plays a major role in ''[[Ten Desires]]'' as the 4th [[Stage]] [[Boss]] and for being the one who taught [[Taoism]] to [[Toyosatomimi no Miko]].

==General Information==
===Personality===
[[File:ThGK Bunbunmaru4.jpg|left|thumb|Seiga, as caught on film rummaging through someone's possessions]]
Seiga is a rather prideful girl who thinks Taoism is superior to other religions and tries to get people to convert. She acts to further her own goals, and nothing more, which is why she is labeled a wicked [[hermit]] and not accepted by the heavens. She doesn't seem to care about anyone, instead manipulating them for her own ends. Her revival of Yoshika's corpse shows her lack of regard for human rights. She doesn't appear interested in material possessions at all, despite her ability to pass through walls. However, in ''[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]]'', she does take on a role of reverse-Santa Claus and steals people's belongings to sell back to whoever they bought it from.

She dislikes [[Byakuren Hijiri]] and eagerly awaits [[Toyosatomimi no Miko]]'s revival. She is, however, very fond and proud of [[Yoshika Miyako]] and treats her more as a pet than a normal servant. She is someone who follows those she likes, but feels no particularly obligation to such people, making her alliance with Miko less assured than the other Taoists.

===Abilities===
;Ability to pass through walls
Seiga's ability doesn't function by making her intangible; instead she uses her hairpin to ''physically cut holes in walls'', which disappear after a while. Walls don't need to be vertical, and she can use her ability on the ground to create tunnels. Walls made of soft materials appear to be more difficult for her to pass through than hard ones. She also appears to be able to use her ability on liquid walls, though the one known instance of this was a special case where the wall of water was layered, extremely powerful, and closed the holes she made almost instantly. She once opened a hole in the [[Hakurei Shrine]]'s wall&lt;ref&gt;''[[Ten Desires]]'': [[Reimu Hakurei]]'s alternate ending&lt;/ref&gt;, and in ''[[Impossible Spell Card]]'' she is able to teleport by passing through the "screen walls", in the same way [[Seija]] can do by using the Gap Folding Umbrella (Although this is a "forced" demonstration of this ability, that wouldn't be possible outside of gameplay mechanics).

This ability might refer to the magical plow which can pass through any obstacle in the original "Qing'e" story. In the story, the plow was given to Huo Huan by a passing Taoist, and Huo Huan proceeded to use the plow to open a wall in Qing'e's chamber so he could have a good look at her, which eventually led to their marriage. When Qing'e became a [[hermit]], Huo Huan used the plow again to bring her back when Qing'e's father tried to lock him out of their mountain retreat.

Another reference exists in volume 1, chapter 15, "Taoist Climbing Mountain in Vain" (simplified:{{lang|zh|劳山道士}}, traditional:{{lang|zh-Hant-TW|勞山道士}}), where Wang ({{lang|zh|王}}) temporarily gains the ability to pass through walls, although the main theme of it's however his inadequacy for becoming a hermit due to lack of patience.

==Backstory==
It isn't stated where exactly Seiga comes from, but as she lived in the mountains early in her life and then "crossed the sea" to meet [[Toyosatomimi no Miko]] and has a jiang-shi familiar, it can be assumed that she lived in China. After Seiga's father became engrossed with [[Taoism]] and left their family to become a hermit, Seiga realized her own passion for Taoism.

Eventually, she was able to marry into the Kaku family. She had the freedom to do as she pleased, but this didn't include Taoism, and she ended up spending eight years depressed and not willing to speak with anyone. At the end of the eight years, Seiga abruptly bid her new family farewell and faked her own death by using Taoist arts to disguise a bamboo shoot as her body. Her family found and buried this "body", while Seiga was finally free to become a [[hermit]] like her father before her.

She refined her Taoist beliefs and techniques for many years, though apparently many of the things she did toward this end were somewhat taboo, including gaining an unaging body, and she ended up being feared by the common people. [[Heaven]] also did not acknowledge her, thus giving her the title of a "wicked hermit" – her willingness to trick her family and fake her own death without any remorse points towards a personality that higher beings didn't consider to be a good thing.

Though her Taoist technique was strong, hermits such as herself weren't overly rare in the land she lived in. She wished to spread Taoism to many people, though, so she decided to move to Japan, which didn't have quite as many hermits living there.

She arrived in Japan as beliefs in [[Buddhism]] and [[Shinto]] were deadlocked with each other. Seizing the opportunity, she convinced Toyosatomimi no Miko, a well-known "virtuous person" considered by some to be a saint, to come to the side of Taoism. Their goal was to use it to achieve immortality, and their plan was to spread the ways of Buddhism throughout the country. Seiga had no real desire to use her powers for the good of the rest of the nation, however.

Details on Seiga's own move to [[Gensokyo]] are non-existent, but after she did, she revived an [[Yoshika Miyako|ancient Japanese author]] as a [[Jiang Shi]], as she had found the mausoleum where Miko, [[Mononobe no Futo]] and [[Soga no Tojiko]] were buried and wanted to protect it.

==Character Design==
===Name===
[[File:ThGKSeiga.png|right|thumb|200px|Seiga and Yoshika as depicted in ''[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]]'']]
Her full name is {{nihongo|''Seiga Kaku''|霍 青娥}}. Her nickname is {{nihongo||青娥 娘々|Seiga Nyan Nyan|lit. "Lady Seiga"}}. {{nihongo||霍|Kaku}} is a genuine if uncommon Chinese surname pronounced "Huo" in Mandarin Chinese. Likewise, her given name {{nihongo||青娥|Seiga}}, is pronounced "Qing'e" in Mandarin Chinese and literally means "Blue/Green/Youth Beauty". The {{nihongo||娘々|Nyan Nyan}} part of her nickname is an approximation of "Niang Niang", which is an archaic word for referring to an empress, a consort, or a goddess.

Qing'e ({{lang|zh|青娥}}) is the name of a tale, on the 14th chapter of the 7th volume in the Chinese ghost story collection ''[[wikipedia:Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio|Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio]]'' (simplified: {{lang|zh|聊斋志异}}, traditional: {{lang|zh-Hant-TW|聊齋志異}}), in which the eponymous heroine, surname Wu ({{lang|zh|武}}), follows her father's footsteps to seek Dao but falls in love with a Huo Huan ({{lang|zh|霍桓}}) and marries him. She is presumed dead later in the story, but her husband finds out that she became a [[hermit]] with her father and seeks her return.

By present-day Japanese naming schema, a lady normally renames her family name that of her husband on the family register. But Chinese couples don't do it; they have different surname even after marriage. So when we identify Seiga as the Qing'e, Seiga's actual name shouldn't be Huo Qing'e ({{lang|zh|霍青娥}}), but probably Wu Qing'e ({{lang|ja|武青娥}}), or Huowu Qing'e ({{lang|ja|霍武青娥}}) in dual-surname system ({{lang|ja|冠姓}}).

===Design===
In ''[[Ten Desires]]'''s official art, she has blue eyes and hair of the same color styled with two Chinese style hair loops secured with a relatively large [[wikipedia:Hair stick|hair stick]]. She wears a simple teal dress with a floral design with a white and blue vest with Chinese patterns. On her waist is a flower secured by her belt. On her left leg is a talisman likely for [[Yoshika Miyako|Yoshika]]-related reasons. She sits on a flowing, translucent white cloth.

Seiga was guarding the entrance to the [[Hall of Dreams' Great Mausoleum]] when she encounters the heroine. Knowing she was the one who beat her underling, she attacks her with Yoshika as a "round two". After being beaten, she explains the heroine she is not one who got resurrected and the circumstances of the event.

;''Hopeless Masquerade''
[[File:Th135Seiga.png|frame|Seiga in ''HM'']]
Seiga appeared in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'' as a background cameo on the [[Divine Spirit Mausoleum]] stage. She can be seen waving.

;''Impossible Spell Card''
Presumably from hearing or seeing a wanted sign about the mischief-making [[amanojaku]] [[Seija Kijin]], Seiga appears to be one of the many [[human]]s and [[youkai]] that tries to capture her. She uses [[spell card]]s that are considered impossible to dodge. Not only did she try to capture Seija herself, she was also controlling [[Yoshika Miyako]] on one spell card.

===Literature===
;''Wild and Horned Hermit''
[[File:Seiga-WaHH12.png|thumb|120px|right|Seiga as seen ''WaHH'' chapter 12.]]
Seiga makes an appearance in Chapter 12 of ''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]''. After [[Komachi Onozuka]] explains that [[human]]s who exceed their lifespan are set upon by "something scarier than a [[shinigami]]" to carry them to their deaths, Seiga – who has recently come above ground – is encased in an extremely tall tower of gushing water, presumably in an effort to kill the wicked [[hermit]]. The [[kappa]] that live there don't have the power to do anything about it, and despite Seiga's ability to phase through walls using her hair stick, she cannot manage to break through the multiple layers of water surrounding her. Instead, using the ground as a "wall", she essentially digs her way out and ends up at the [[Hakurei Shrine]].

==Relationships==
===[[Yoshika Miyako]]=== 
She is the superior of [[Yoshika Miyako]] who is a guard of [[Hall of Dreams' Great Mausoleum]]. Seiga is very fond of Yoshika, often calling her "my cute underling". The charm on her forehead apparently contains a to-do list, written by Seiga. As Yoshika says "we" were revived to protect the Hall of Dreams' Great Mausoleum, there may be more [[Jiang Shi]] guards under the control of Seiga, or simply people temporarily converted by Yoshika's bite.

===[[Mononobe no Futo]] and [[Soga no Tojiko]]===
They were her allies in ''[[Ten Desires]]'', but Seiga's relationship with them doesn't seem to be particularly close (see Toyosatomimi no Miko section below).

===[[Toyosatomimi no Miko]]===
Seiga trained Toyosatomimi no Miko in Taoist spells and charms. It seems to be a relationship of mutual respect, as in [[Reimu Hakurei]]'s parallel ending in ''[[Ten Desires]]'' Seiga calls Miko "Lady Toyosatomimi". However, as of ''[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]]'' Akyuu notes that there doesn't seem to be any particular friendship between Seiga and the other Taoists; Miko herself seems to want to distance herself from Seiga, by not trying to defend her actions.

===Minor Characters===
;[[Kasen Ibaraki]]
Seiga briefly meets Kasen in ''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'', though little interaction is had between the pair of hermits. Kasen notes that Seiga definitely seems like she's lived for too long.

;[[Marisa Kirisame]]
Marisa fought Seiga in ''[[Ten Desires]]''. Some time before ''[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]]'' Marisa stole Seiga's veil, leading Seiga to break into her house to take it back.

==Additional Information==
*There is an anachronism about her being interested about [[wikipedia:He Xiangu|He Xiangu]] and her collaboration with [[Toyosatomimi no Miko]]. He Xiangu is allegedly born in the early [[wikipedia:Tang Dynasty|Tang Dynasty]]. Seiga had to be born during or before the [[wikipedia:Southern and Northern Dynasties|Southern and Northern Dynasties]] to be able to teach [[Toyosatomimi no Miko]] [[Taoism]]. Maybe ZUN had misunderstood Shanxi people(晋人, 晋 means [[wikipedia:Shanxi|Shanxi]]) as Jin people(晋人, 晋 means [[wikipedia:Jin_dynasty_(265–420)|Jin dynasty]]).
**One of the solutions is to let Seiga pass through walls of time just the same as walls of space.
*Even being the one that declares all her spell cards during her [[boss]] battle, [[Yoshika Miyako]] is the one that shoots most bullets. During such, her focus is mostly resurrecting Yoshika every time she becomes disabled.
**Interestingly enough, it seems that while resurrecting Yoshika, her sprite appears to change colors, similar to [[Kanako Yasaka]].
*She is one of the only characters in the series who is explicitly known to have been married. However, it isn't known if she bore any children (In the ''[[wikipedia:Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio|Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio]]'', Qing'e had &lt;!-- spoiler for the book--&gt;two sons and one daughter.). The other characters known to have been married are [[Watatsuki no Toyohime]], [[Watatsuki no Yorihime]], and [[Junko]].
*Seiga references [[wikipedia:Jesus|Jesus Christ]] in ''[[Ten Desires]]'', telling [[Youmu Konpaku]] that [[Toyosatomimi no Miko|Miko]]'s return will be much more magnificent than "that foreign prophet who resurrected three days after his execution".

　　（通称：青娥 娘々（せいが にゃんにゃん））&lt;br/&gt;
　　Kaku Seiga

　　種族：邪仙&lt;br/&gt;
　　能力：壁をすり抜けられる程度の能力


　　元々は道士に憧れた人間である。

　　青娥が幼い頃、父親が道教にはまり彼女を置いて山に篭もってしまった。&lt;br/&gt;
　　父が残した本に興味を持った彼女は、何度も何度も本を読み返し、道士に憧れるようになった。特に何仙姑（かせんこ：道教八仙人の一人）に憧れ、いずれ自分も仙人となり父に会うと誓った。


　　成長した彼女は、名家である霍家に嫁入りすることが出来た。何一つ不自由無い生活をしていたが、道士への夢は捨てきれず、毎日鬱々と生活していた。次第に引き籠もりがちとなり、誰とも会話しようとしなくなった。

　　それからさらに八年経ったある日、青娥は突然別れの言葉を言いだした。家族は不思議に思ったが、青娥は自分の部屋でいつものように眠り、そして二度と目覚める事はなかったのである。


　　それに驚いた家族は深い悲しみに暮れ、全く生気の無い彼女を埋葬した。


　　しかし、彼女は死んでいなかったのである。&lt;br/&gt;
　　彼女は引き籠もっていた間、本で学んで覚えた術を使い、竹の棒を自分の姿に見せて死んだように見せかけたのだ。家族はそれを埋葬したのである。

　　彼女は俗世を捨て逃げ出した。そう、憧れの仙人の世界に行く為に。


　　――それからどの位経ったのだろう。&lt;br/&gt;
　　彼女は仙人として、ある程度の力を身に付けていた。姿も常に若いままを保ち、不老長寿となっていた。&lt;br/&gt;
　　その為に人前では憚られる様な事も色々した。しかしそれが天には認められず邪仙となってしまったようだ。彼女は自分の目的の為なら家族を欺くことも厭わなかった。そんな性格が良くなかったようである。

　　彼女は道教を広めるというていで、自分の力を見せびらかす事が趣味であった。しかしこの国では自分くらいの道士や仙人も珍しくない。そこで、仙人の居ない国に行こうと思い、まだ見ぬ東の国を目指した。日本の事である。


　　当時の日本では大陸から広まったばかりの仏教と、古来からある土着神を信仰する神道の二つの宗教が覇権を争っていた。

　　彼女は「これは好機」と思い、当時一番徳があると思われる豊聡耳神子に取り入り、道教の魅力を伝えた。

　　政治には仏教を使って民衆を大人しくさせ、権力者は道教で超人的な力を身に付けるといい、そう吹き込んだのだ。

　　道教は自然崇拝、多神教である為、権力者を神々の末裔とする神道との相性は良い。しかも最終目的は不老不死であり、権力者にとってストイックな仏教よりも魅力的なものだった。&lt;br/&gt;
　　神子は少し考えた後、その案を本来宗教敵であった物部氏に話を持っていったのだ。

| translation= 　○Stage 4 Boss　　'''The Wicked Hermit Who Passes Through Walls'''


(Nickname: Seiga Nyan Nyan, lit. Lady Seiga)&lt;br/&gt;
Seiga Kaku

Species: Wicked Hermit&lt;br/&gt;
Ability: Passing through walls


Once, she was a human in awe of the Tao.

When Seiga was young, her father took a liking to the Tao and left her behind to shut himself up in the mountains. Finding herself interested in a book her father had left behind, she read through it over and over, and became attracted to the Tao. She was particularly interested in He Xiangu (Kasenko, one of the eight sages of Taoism), and swore she'd become a hermit one day, too, and meet her father.

As she grew older, she was able to marry into the Kaku family. She led a life without any restrictions on her freedom, but she was unable to throw away her aspirations towards Taoism, and she spent every day depressed. As a result, she practically became a shut-in, never conversing with anyone.

One day, after eight more years had passed, Seiga suddenly said her goodbyes. Her family thought it was odd but as Seiga fell sleep, seemingly like any other day, she never opened her eyes again.


Surprised, a great sadness cast itself over her family, and they buried her utterly lifeless body.


However, she wasn't dead. While she'd been shut away in her room, she used a technique she'd read about in her book to make a bamboo rod take the form of her own body, making her appear to be dead. That was what her family had buried.

She cast away her worldly life and ran. Yes, she ran to join the world of hermits she'd so yearned for.


―――Countless time has passed. As a hermit, she'd gained a certain amount of power. She maintained her
youthful appearance, becoming unaging. In order to reach this far, she also did many things which made her feared by the public.
However, the Heavens did not acknowledged her and she became a wicked hermit. She didn't even hesitate to deceive her family in order to fulfill her own personal goal. That was not a good behavior at all.

She had a tendency to "Spread the ways of Taoism", as a pretense for showing off her powers. However, Taoists and hermits of her level weren't that unusual in this country. So, she thought she'd move to a hermit-less country, and headed out for a country in the east she'd never seen before: Japan.


At that time in Japan, Buddhism, which had just spread there from the continent, and Shinto, which placed its faith in Japan's native gods, were locked in battle for supremacy.

Thinking this was the perfect chance, she caught the ear of Toyosatomimi no Miko, who was widely seen as a most virtuous person, and taught her of the charms of Taoism.

She suggested to the powerful ones that they use Buddhism in politics to keep the people from getting restless, while they used Taoism to attain superhuman strength for themselves.

Since Taoism was a nature-worshipping polytheistic creed, it fit well with the beliefs of Shinto, which held the powerful in Japan to be descendents of the gods. And since its ultimate goal was immortality, it was a compelling alternative for them to the more stoic Buddhism. A little while after she thought about it, Miko spoke to her former religious rival, the Mononobe clan, of this plan.

{{nihongo|'''Seija Kijin'''|鬼人 正邪|Kijin Seija}} is the main protagonist of [[Impossible Spell Card]] and the minigame [[Gold Rush]]. She's an [[amanojaku]] with the power to turn over anything. She resides in the [[Shining Needle Castle]].

==General Information==
Seija first appeared as the fifth stage boss of ''[[Double Dealing Character]]'', and was behind the main plot of the game. Her main objective was to overthrow society, and to make the weak rule over the strong. She then appeared as the main protagonist in ''[[Impossible Spell Card]]''.
===Personality===
She thinks the opposite of what other people think, likes what others hate, and hates herself when she makes others happy. She's inclined to be purposely disobedient and avoids being charitable. In general, no one liked her, and she liked that fact. She also tends to be talkative.

===Abilities===
;Turn over anything
As literally stated, Seija is able to turn over anything into its opposite state. This can be seen in her [[Double Dealing Character/Spell Cards/Stage 5|Spell Cards]] that flip the screen horizontally, vertically, and 180 degrees.

===Possession===
{{Main|Impossible Spell Card#Gameplay|l1=Impossible Spell Card - Gameplay}}
Throughout ''Impossible Spell Card'', Seija acquires nine different magical items imbued with the Miracle Mallet's magic. Each of them has effects that are beneficial to the user. They are the Nimble Fabric, Tengu's Toy Camera, Gap-Folding Umbrella (which she stole from [[Yukari]]), Bloodthirsty Yin-Yang Orb, Four-Foot Magic Bomb, Ghastly Send-Off Lantern, Substitute Jizo, Cursed Decoy Doll, and the Miracle Mallet Replica. It's unknown what happened to them after the events of the game.

==Backstory==
Seija was the one who originally found the [[Miracle Mallet]]. Once she realized it contained the power to realize her ambition, she sought out an [[inchling]] named [[Shinmyoumaru Sukuna]], as inchlings are the only ones able to use it. In order to draw Shinmyoumaru to her own side, she made up a story about how the inchling race was humiliated for ages, blaming the youkai for their downfall. She got Shinmyoumaru to agree with her plan.

==Character Design==
===Name===
Her name is {{nihongo|''Seija Kijin''|鬼人 正邪}}. Her first name {{nihongo||正邪|Seija}} can be loosely translated as "good and evil" or "right and wrong." Her last name {{nihongo||鬼人|Kijin}} is spelled with characters meaning "[[oni]]" and "[[human]]". "{{lang|ja|邪}}" and "{{lang|ja|鬼}}" are both characters that make up the name of her species: {{nihongo||天邪鬼|[[Amanojaku]]}}. Although her given name has the character for "oni," and her species is often depicted as a type of oni in Japanese folklore, amanojaku in the ''[[Touhou Project]]'' are a separate species. Both her first and last names reference her ability, as each is composed of two kanji with opposite meanings: human/oni and right/wrong.

===Design===
Seija has red eyes and black hair with white highlights in the back and a single red highlight on her front bangs, although in ''[[Impossible Spell Card]]'' she has a single white highlight, with multiple red highlights. Her hair reaches down to her shoulders. She has two small, light blue horns, and she wears a white dress that ends in gray, red, and black spade patterns that may symbolize her ability, as they look like arrows pointing downward and upward depending on the perspective. The dress is wrapped at the waist with an upside-down blue bow. She wears traditional sandals with purple straps. She also wears a gold-colored bracelet on her right arm.

==Appearances==
;''Double Dealing Character''
[[File:Th14SeijaSprite.png|frame|Seija's sprite in ''DDC'']]
Seija is the stage 5 boss, residing in the [[Shining Needle Castle]]. At first, she thinks the heroine is there to ally with them, and explains her plan to overthrow society. However, she quickly gets irritated with the heroine's perceived lack of empathy for the "plight of the weak", and attacks. After she is defeated, she guides the heroine deeper into the castle, but is beaten again in order to get to Shinmyoumaru.

;''Impossible Spell Card''
[[File:Th143SeijaBackSprite.png|frame|left|Seija's back sprite in ''ISC'']]
:{{Main|Impossible Spell Card#Story|l1=Impossible Spell Card: Story}}
Seija is the main protagonist and only playable character in ''[[Impossible Spell Card]]''. Following the events of ''[[Double Dealing Character]]'', she has become a wanted [[amanojaku]] in [[Gensokyo]]. There have been signs saying that whoever captures her wins a reward, resulting in characters like [[Kagerou Imaizumi]] and [[Raiko Horikawa]] trying to capture her. Since Seija has become a rebel, the youkai decide to use [[spell card]]s that are considered impossible to dodge, but Seija is determined to not give up and decides to cheat using items.

Later on however, [[Mamizou Futatsuiwa]] confronts her and says that the [[tengu]] (presumably [[Aya Shameimaru]] and [[Hatate Himekaidou]]) have taken notice of her and have written up a newspaper about her mischief. This causes stronger [[youkai]] and [[human]]s such as [[Marisa Kirisame]], [[Sakuya Izayoi]], [[Sanae Kochiya]], and [[Youmu Kompaku]] to try and capture her. [[Shinmyoumaru Sukuna]] also confronts her and declares that she should return the remainder of the Mallet's magic and that they've lost the war that occurred during ''Double Dealing Character''. Seija believes that she can use her cheating magic to conquer [[Gensokyo]]. Shinmyoumaru states that they ought to surrender because she has had enough. Since Seija goes against her will, Shinmyoumaru goes against Seija and gets others to capture her, becoming one of the many to try and stop Seija.

In the end, it's revealed that Seija has lost all of her allies, but it's nothing to worry about because the [[amanojaku]] can never really make friends anyway.

;''Gold Rush
Seija again appeared as the only playable character in ''[[Gold Rush]]''. Extending from ''[[Impossible Spell Card]]'', somehow acquiring the ultimate rule-breaking item, Seija sets about robbing the [[Hakurei Shrine]]. She uses two "cheat" items; the Substitute Jizo from the previous game and the 10th "rule-breaking" item, the [[Miracle Mallet]] (Real), which is capable of destroying danmaku. She has to make use of it before its power runs out. This is somewhat similar to [[Cirno]]'s "perfect freeze" in ''[[Fairy Wars]]''. Unlike ''ISC'' however, Seija cannot shoot.

==Relationships==
===Shinmyoumaru Sukuna===
Seija initially approached [[Shinmyoumaru Sukuna]] to persuade her to use the [[Miracle Mallet]] for her own ends. In order to do so, she falsified a history of the inchlings to turn the girl against society.

As mentioned above, during the events of [[Impossible Spell Card]], Shinmyoumaru attempted to convince Seija to surrender to her pursuers, and to return the portion of the Mallet's power that she seized. When Seija refused, the two ended up fighting.

Despite this, the two were on good terms as of [[The Grimoire of Usami]], with Shinmyoumaru requesting Seija's help to hijack the Hakurei Fireworks Contest.

===Minor Relationships===
; Benben Tsukumo and Yatsuhashi Tsukumo
Though no dialogue is exchanged between them, Seija appears to understand the heroine when they mention that a koto or biwa tsukumogami told them about her plan. As they all have the same objective, it is likely that they know each other. However, Seija's reaction implies that she didn't realize the extent of the "payment" of the Miracle Mallet's power - that is, changing many objects into tsukumogami without the user intending to do so.

==Additional Information==
*The silhouette of Seija occupies on the front of ''[[Impossible Spell Card]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s jewel case.
*Some parts of Seija's theme are symmetrical making it sound similar to itself when played reversed (much like Koishi's theme); this is probably a reference to her ability to turn things over and to the theme name itself: ''Reverse Ideology''.
*Apparently the relationship of the main villains of [[Double Dealing Character]], Seija and Shinmyoumaru, is vague. But it might be a little wrong. it is said that amanojaku (or Ama-no-Jaku) is rooted in a female deity of Japanese mythology, Ame-no-Sagume. In the age Ama-tsu-kami (God Clan in Heaven) and Kuni-tsu-kami (God Clan on Ground) were in battles. then Ama-tsu-kami sent a god Ame-no-Wakahiko for "negotiation". But he neither came back nor took a message — he married there and had no will to be on the side of Ama-tsu-kami; he switched or reverted his side. And it was Ame-no-Sagume who later gave advice to him that he should shoot Ama-tsu-kami's spy. This shows some resemblances of Ame-no-Sagume and amanojaku (or Seija): they are a traitor's friend, and their seducer. Another point, remember that Shinmyoumaru's root from Japanese mythology is Sukunahiko, who created the kingdom of Kuni-tsu-kami with Ookuninushi, where Ame-no-sagume lived as above. This means we can see that Shinmyoumaru's rooted god (or Shinmyoumaru's first ancestor) had taken part in Kuni-tsu-kami's side by far before Seija's rooted god (Ame-no-Sagume) appeared.
*In her profile, the term [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gekokuj%C5%8D Gekokujō] (下克上, also 下剋上) is a Japanese term for "overthrowing/surpassing one's superiors". It is variously translated as "the lower rules the higher" or "the low overcomes the high".

Stage 5 Boss - Counterattacking Amanojaku&lt;br /&gt;
Kijin Seija

Species: Amanojaku&lt;br /&gt;
Ability: Capable of turning over anything

An amanojaku that schemed for the lower to rule the higher.&lt;br /&gt;
Amanojaku aren't oni, but just a particularly twisted type of youkai.

She's always thinking the opposite of what other people think.&lt;br /&gt;
She likes what people hate, and falls into self-loathing when she makes them happy.&lt;br /&gt;
She never listens to orders. Even if she profits off something, she doesn't give anything in return.&lt;br /&gt;
It was only natural that humans and youkai disliked her, but she was happy to be disliked.

Her ambition was to turn over Gensokyo.&lt;br /&gt;
She wanted to smash the current stable Gensokyo where the strong ruled the land,&lt;br /&gt;
and change it into one where the weak had more value.

However, she didn't have the power to do that.&lt;br /&gt;
Then, she laid her eyes upon the treasure of the inchlings, the "Miracle Mallet".

{{nihongo|'''Seiran'''|清蘭|Seiran}} is a [[moon rabbit]] who appears as the [[stage]] 1 [[boss]] in ''[[Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom]]''.

==General Information==

===Personality===
It seems that it's hard for her to hold a regular conversation, even with her Moon Rabbit comrades, implying that she's either shy or doesn't get much respect from her fellow moon rabbits. She was making mochi for them despite being on break &lt;ref name="SP"&gt; ''[[Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom]]'' - Seiran's omake &lt;/ref&gt; , which confirms the latter.

===Abilities===
;Firing bullets from other dimensions
Not much is known about the specifics of the abilities, other than to fire bullets from other dimensions. From what she can do, it implies that there's some form of teleportation going on.

===Occupation===
Seiran was a member of the "Eagle Ravi" Earth Recon Unit sent to "purify" the Earth and is part of the Lunarian Military Infiltrators. She's in charge of the Infiltration operations, one of the most dangerous jobs. Seiran doesn't get much respect, being treated as cannon fodder &lt;ref name="SP"/&gt;. No reinforcements come to her aid and would've been slain if she blurted out the location of her base. &lt;ref&gt; ''[[Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom]]'' - [[Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom/Story/Reimu's Scenario|Reimu's Scenario]]&lt;/ref&gt; She doesn't get paid much despite the risks. After the events of ''[[Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom]]'' she abandons the Moon and came to Gensokyo, now being a Dango salesgirl.

===Possessions===
Seiran possesses a hammer-shaped pounding mallet, which she uses to pound mochi as well as fire danmaku. It's unknown if she could also use it as a melee weapon.

==Character Design==
===Name===
{{nihongo|''Seiran''|清蘭}} is spelled with the characters for {{nihongo|''sei''|清}} "clear, pure, clean", and {{nihongo|''ran''|蘭}} "[[wikipedia:Orchidaceae|orchid]]" a plant of the orchid family, bearing unusually-shaped flowers of beautiful colours; it could also means "elegant, graceful". Seiran is also the name for a Japanese attack floatplane used during World War 2, the Aichi M6A1.

===Design===
Seiran has dark blue hair, tied in two bushy ponytails, with ears similar to [[Reisen Udongein Inaba]]'s on the top of her head and an accessory in one of them, she has red eyes, a common trait in [[Rabbit|Moon Rabbits]]. Her dress is periwinkle with frills and an alternating star and crescent moon pattern across the bottom. The bloomers under her skirt seem to be made of see-through fabric. She also carries a purple stained wooden mallet (presumably used for making [[wikipedia:Mochi|Mochi]]).
Although it's not visible in her portraits, she also has a tail.&lt;ref&gt;[[Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom/Music|Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom - Seiran's theme]] - '''ZUN:''' ''You can't see it, but she does have a tail.'' &lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearances==
{{stub|section}}
;''Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom''
After meeting the protagonists, she decides to fight against them as her mission to ''purify'' the Earth, but when she is defeated she complains about being in the ground troops and lets the player continue to their base.
[[File:Th15SeiranSprite.png|frame|Seiran's sprite in ''LoLK'']]

===Literature===

;''Alternative Facts in Eastern Utopia''
Aya Shameimaru reports the competition between Seiran and [[Ringo]] of who sells more dango in the Human Village. Aya claims Ringo is winning but that she supports Seiran, although she explains that she does it because she always wants to support the weak part.

==Relationships==
;Ringo
Along with [[Ringo]] both are members of the "''Eagle Ravi''" ''Earth Recon Unit'' sent to "purify" the Earth. After the events of ''[[Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom]]'' they both deserted the moon and became business rivals as Dango salesgirls.
;Reisen Udongein Inaba
She seem to have known [[Reisen Udongein Inaba|Reisen]] before she fled to Gensokyo as both were part of the Lunarian Military.

{{nihongo|'''Sekibanki'''|赤蛮奇}} is a [[Wikipedia:Rokurokubi|rokurokubi]] living undercover as a [[human]] in the [[Human Village]].

==General Information==
Sekibanki is a Rokurokubi that dwells in the [[Human Village]] in disguise as a human. She first appeared as the Stage 2 Mid-Boss and Boss in ''[[Double Dealing Character]]'', and then as a Day 2 Boss in ''[[Impossible Spell Card]]''.

===Personality===
Sekibanki is described as being slighty prideful and with a cynical view of things. She became aggressive and somewhat more youkai-like than usual when affected by the [[Miracle Mallet]], but it seems that she is normally recalcitrant towards both humans and youkai, and she doesn't get involved much with them.

===Abilities===
;Making her head fly
As literally stated, Sekibanki can detach her head from her body and move it at will.

;Multiplying heads
Many of her spell cards involve creating clones of her head, to attack from different places at once. It's unknown if they are actual heads that can think on their own to some extent (Like [[Flandre]]'s [[Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil/Spell_Cards/Extra#Spell_Card_57|Taboo "Four of a Kind"]]), or just replicas resembling the original.

;Long neck
She has shown to be able to elongate her neck to great extent. This is especially notable in [[Impossible_Spell_Card/Spell_Cards/2nd_Day#Spell_Card_2_-_2|one of her spell cards]].

==Character Design==
===Origin===
Although she's referred to as a rokurokubi in-game, Sekibanki has a few different inspirations. In Japanese folklore, a rokurokubi is a [[youkai]] that can stretch its neck to great extents. There's also a type of youkai called a nukekubi, which can remove its head completely. Although it may seem like Sekibanki is based exclusively on the nukekubi, she still does have the elongated neck of a rokurokubi (best seen in her spell cards Flying Neck "Extreme Long Neck" and Flying Neck "Twin Rokuro Head"). [[ZUN]] also uses the term '[[Wikipedia:Dullahan|Dullahan]]' as a translation or close approximation of her species' name in English.

===Name===
{{nihongo|''Sekibanki''|赤蛮奇}} is spelled with the characters for "red", "barbarian", and "anomaly". The characters are read using their [[wikipedia:Kanji#On'yomi (Sino-Japanese reading)|on'yomi]], or Chinese readings, unlike with most ''[[Touhou Project]]'' [[characters]]. The second character, {{nihongo|''ban''|蛮}}, is likely taken from {{nihongo|''hitouban''|飛頭蛮}}, which is a Chinese youkai equivalent to the rokurokubi.

===Design===
Sekibanki has red hair and eyes. She wears a blue bow with red trimmings and a red and blue capelet that covers part of her face. She also wears a black and red long sleeved shirt, as well as a dark red skirt and red and black boots. When she's defeated, her portrait with a slash in her skirt show that she wears a white undershirt.

==Appearances==
===Games===
;''Double Dealing Character''
[[File:Th14SekibankiSprite.png|frame|Sekibanki's sprite in ''DDC'']]
:{{Main|Double Dealing Character/Story/Reimu A's Scenario#Stage 2|l1=Reimu A Arc|Double Dealing Character/Story/Reimu B's Scenario#Stage 2|l2=Reimu B Arc}} 
Sekibanki shows in front of Reimu, asking if she's there to exterminate her. At first, she doesn't recognize her opponent as the shrine maiden of Hakurei, and attacks her after claiming that humans have become too confident because the youkai have been calm for a while. After being defeated, she understands who her opponent was, and runs away.
:{{Main|Double Dealing Character/Story/Marisa A's Scenario#Stage 2|l1=Marisa A Arc}}
Sekibanki shows in front of Marisa, and attacks her after saying that humans' insolence made youkai retaliate. After being defeated, she understands how strong Marisa is and runs away.
:{{Main|Double Dealing Character/Story/Marisa B's Scenario#Stage 2|l1=Marisa B Arc}}
After Sekibanki shows up again, Marisa says that she was quite surprised of seeing her flying head. The youkai attacks again, trying to scare the magician with her ability, but gets defeated and mocked. Sekibanki complains about how fearless humans have become, but Marisa reassures her saying that she is just special.
:{{Main|Double Dealing Character/Story/Sakuya A's Scenario#Stage 2|l1=Sakuya A Arc}}
Sekibanki attacks Sakuya trying to terrorize her, but the maid is far stronger than expected and defeats her.
:{{Main|Double Dealing Character/Story/Sakuya B's Scenario#Stage 2|l1=Sakuya B Arc}}
Sekibanki shows herself, asking Sakuya if she's there to exterminate her. The maid says that she's pacifying all the rampaging youkai, but Sekibanki claims that it's too late and that the youkai counterattack has already begun. Sakuya defeats her, saying that no one except Reimu would hurt her if she behaves herself.

===Spin-offs===
;''Impossible Spell Card''
Presumably from hearing or seeing a wanted sign about the mischief-making [[amanojaku]] [[Seija Kijin]], Sekibanki appears to be one of the many [[youkai]] that tries to capture her. She uses [[spell card]]s that are considered impossible to dodge.

==Additional Information==

*In folklore, nukekubi are said to have symbols on their neck where the head detaches, revealing their identity - which may explain Sekibanki's choice to wear a capelet to cover her neck.
*Sekibanki is heavily implied to be a member of the [[Grassroots Youkai Network]] in her, Wakasagihime, and Kagerou's article in [[Strange Creators of Outer World/Who's Who of Humans &amp; Youkai in Gensokyo/Wakasagihime, Sekibanki and Kagerou Imaizumi|Who's Who of Humans and Youkai in Gensokyo]].

However, this time, she went berserk for some reason.

The {{nihongo|'''Shanghai Doll'''|上海人形|shanhai ningyou}} or '''Shanghai''' ({{lang|ja|上海}}) for short, is [[Alice Margatroid|Alice Margatroid]]'s [[doll]]. She is the only doll that Alice is known to have a name for.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Imperishable Night]]'' - Manual.&lt;/ref&gt; Generally "Shanghai" refers to the doll Alice is always accompanied with. However the relationship between her and Alice in canon is vague and not clear. Her images of characteristics (including the name, appearance and personality) come from secondary works. The name "Shanghai Doll" first appeared in Alice's ''Curse "Eerily Luminous Shanghai Dolls"'' spell cards (spell cards 041, 042, and 043 of ''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]''). 

==Character Basis==
===Name===
The name Shanghai is a reference to a class of Alice's dolls. Coincidentally, the term "Shanghai Doll" was popularized in one phrase of [[Wikipedia:Yellow Magic Orchestra|Yellow Magic Orchestra]]'s song "Chuugoku Onna" (Chinese Woman, {{lang|ja|中国女}}. Official title is "La femme chinoise", a parody of [[Wikipedia:Jean-Luc Godard|Jean-Luc Godard]]'s "[[Wikipedia:La Chinoise|La Chinoise]]"); &lt;i&gt;"For Susie Wong and &lt;b&gt;Shanghai dolls&lt;/b&gt;"&lt;/i&gt;. [[wikipedia:Shanghai|Shanghai]] is a city in China, and all of Alice's spell cards with names in ''Perfect Cherry Blossom'' were named after cities or countries.

===Design===
In the game usually a doll is drawn next to Alice; this doll is commonly regarded as Shanghai, but it is not indicated in canon whether it is her.
This entry describes the appearance of Alice's doll in general.

The sprite of a doll in ''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]'' shows that her dress and shoes are dark red and she has a set of four fairy-like wings.

In ''[[Immaterial and Missing Power]]'''s official art, a doll wears a long dark purple dress with a white apron and white sleeves, and matching dark purple shoes. There is a large red bow in her hair and a smaller matching bow around her neck.

In ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]'''s official art, a doll has blonde hair and blue eyes. She wears a back colored dress with a white apron with black sleeves. The bows on her head and dress are colored in a lighter red and she appears to be holding a razor.

{{nihongo|'''Shinki'''|神綺}} is the creator of [[Makai]], a world of [[demon]]s whose entrance is located near the [[Hakurei Shrine]] in a mountain cave. She describes herself as a [[god]].  

==Character Design==
===Name===
Her name is {{nihongo|''Shinki''|神綺}}. {{nihongo|''Shin''|[[Wiktionary:神|神]]}} means "god", and {{nihongo|''ki''|[[Wiktionary:綺|綺]]}} means either "fine thin silk", "figured cloth", "elegant", or "beautiful".

===Design===
Shinki has light-blue eyes with white hair and wears red robes. She's able to summon six white wings, which can turn purple with red markings.

==Appearances==
===PC-98===
;''Mystic Square''
During the events of ''[[Mystic Square]]'', Shinki allowed a [[Makai]] tourist agency to organize trips to [[Gensokyo]] for Makai [[demon]]s, which caused problems for Gensokyo's residents. [[Reimu Hakurei]], [[Marisa Kirisame]], [[Mima]] and [[Yuuka Kazami]] traveled to Makai to put an end to this intrusion, defeating a number of Makai natives and Shinki herself.

{{Officially Non-Canon|section}}
; [[Magus in Mystic Geometries|Shinma Touki Den ~ Magus in Mystic Geometries]]
Like with most of the PC-98 material, Shinki does not appear in the newer Windows series. However, she made an unofficial appearance as the sole boss of the 2008 [[fangame]], . [[ZUN]] had some involvement with the game and composed the music used for the boss fight.

; [[Touhou Unreal Mahjong]]
Shinki reappears as a playable character in the related 2009 [[fangame]], [[Touhou Unreal Mahjong]] using the same song [[ZUN]] composed for her. ZUN also helped with this game for composing another song that was used for [[Rinnosuke]].

Even if it was used for fangames, the song is more or less Shinki's second theme. The song doesn't really have a name; it is generally referred to as "{{lang|ja|神魔討綺伝}} AN ORDEAL FROM GOD" as this was what the ''[[Touhou Unreal Mahjong OST]]'' referred to it as, but like the other two songs from ''Magus in Mystic Geometries'' on the album (arrangements of [[Patchouli]]'s theme), this name simply refers to the game it came from and the song's usage.

==Relationships==
===Yumeko===
[[Yumeko]] works as a [[maid]] for Shinki. Shinki has stated that Yumeko is her strongest creation.

===Alice Margatroid===
{{see also|Canon}}
Alice ''was'' a resident of Makai during the [[PC-98]] era. However, with Alice living in the [[Forest of Magic]] in the [[Windows]] era, the relationship between Shinki and [[Alice Margatroid]] is never directly addressed. It's unclear whether Alice was created by Shinki, was a normal magician who moved to Makai, or if her origins have been retconned by the Windows games. [[Hieda no Akyuu]] states in ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'' that Alice is a former [[human]] who turned into a [[youkai]].

===Minor Relationships===
;Residents of Makai
Since Shinki states that she was the creator of [[Makai]], it can be presumed that all of the residents of Makai were also created by Shinki. Such residents would include [[Yumeko]], [[Sariel]], [[Sara]] (the [[Gatekeeper]] of Makai), [[Yuki]], [[Mai]], [[Louise]], [[Elis]], [[YuugenMagan]], the [[Wheel Demon]], [[Ayana]] and [[stage enemy]] [[demon]]s. It is not clear whether she created [[Alice Margatroid]] of the PC-98 canon, as it is unclear what relation this Alice has to Makai.

==Additional Information==
*Although Makai made a reappearance in the [[Windows]] series as stages 5 and 6 of ''[[Undefined Fantastic Object]]'', Shinki herself was not mentioned, apart from some subtle references. The fairies in these stages have wings with similar colors and markings to Shinki's (these fairies, however, reappear in numerous subsequent games, such as stage 3 of ''[[Fairy Wars]]'' and stage 4 of ''[[Wily Beast and Weakest Creature]]''). In addition, [[Byakuren Hijiri]]'s spell card ''[[Undefined Fantastic Object/Spell Cards/Stage 6#Spell Card 90|Great Magic "Devil's Recitation"]]'' strongly resembles one of Shinki's attack forms.

*Some of Shinki's attacks were replicated by [[SMD-00x]] in the ''[[Project Blank]]'' game ''[[Samidare]]''.

{{nihongo|'''Shinmyoumaru Sukuna'''|少名 針妙丸|Sukuna Shinmyoumaru}} is the main antagonist of [[Double Dealing Character]]. She's an inchling living in the [[Shining Needle Castle]].

==General Information==
Shinmyoumaru first appeared as the Final Boss of ''[[Double Dealing Character]]'', she also appeared in ''[[Impossible Spell Card]]'' as an 8th Day Boss and later in ''[[Urban Legend in Limbo]]'' as a playable character.

Shinmyoumaru is a young inchling, currently residing in the [[Shining Needle Castle]]. Prior to the events of ''[[Double Dealing Character]]'', she was ignorant to the existence of the [[Miracle Mallet]]. During the game's story, she uses it to make herself bigger, enlarging her size to that of a small human child.

===Personality===
Shinmyoumaru acts and speaks as if she was a young child. Along the same lines, she appears easily persuaded, as she readily accepted the fabricated history of the inchlings that [[Seija Kijin]] fed to her. Also, she has a height complex and will always seek ways to become taller, like with the Miracle Mallet or the [[Occult Ball]]s.

===Abilities and Possessions===
;Ability to use the [[Miracle Mallet]]
The Miracle Mallet is an ancient inchling artifact, passed down through the generations, said to be able to grant any wish the user wishes. However, only inchlings are able to use it. In addition, the utilization of the Mallet to grant wishes comes with a price, and for wishes that are too large, it extracts this price before it even grants the wish.

In ''[[Double Dealing Character]]'', Shinmyoumaru tried alongside with [[Seija]] to overturn society with the power of the Miracle Mallet, but the price she had to pay appears to have been the leakage of a lot of magical energy into Gensokyo. This magical energy was responsible for turning normally peaceful youkai into aggressive monsters, and creating tsukumogami such as [[Benben]], [[Yatsuhashi]], and [[Raiko]]. It caused Reimu's purification rod, Marisa's Mini-Hakkero, and a few knives belonging to Sakuya to start "acting" strangely. However, in Sakuya A's route, Shinmyoumaru says that the maid's knife is something she made into a tsukumogami as an experiment, so it's unknown whether or not all the heroines' weapons were the same, or if all of the tsukumogami were her experiments, or if Sakuya's knife was an exception.

;Shining Needle Sword
Whilst appearing as more of an accessory in ''Double Dealing Character'', in ''[[Urban Legend in Limbo]]'', Shinmyoumaru makes heavy use of the Shining Needle Sword in combat. Although appearing to be just an oversized needle, it seems to function very well as a weapon on its own. It seems to be able to produce beams and fishhooks made of energy, and she even uses it in a similar manner to a fishing rod in some moves and spellcards.

===Occupation===
She was a co-conspirator to Seija, and plotted to overturn the hierarchy of society with her. After exhausting the power of the Miracle Mallet in ''[[Double Dealing Character]]'', she began living in a cage-like doll house at the [[Hakurei Shrine]] whilst her body remained tiny and she was waiting for the Miracle Mallet to recover all of its power.  She planned to return to being "tall" afterwards. As of ''[[Urban Legend in Limbo]]'', she is once again normal-sized (albeit very short) and presumably living at the Shining Needle Castle once more.

==Backstory==
Shinmyoumaru is a descendant of Issun-Boushi, a legendary oni-slayer who managed to obtain from them a treasure called the Miracle Mallet. At first, he only used its wish-granting power to make himself bigger and to get himself a princess. He thought that since the Miracle Mallet was an oni's tool, using it recklessly would cause his own ruin.

Several generations later, this particular mindset was all but gone in the minds of most inchlings. One of his descendants decided to use it again in order to live in luxury, thus breaking the taboo. However, the descendant wished for a grand castle and to rule over the inchling people. In that moment, the Shining Needle Castle appeared, and the Mallet's power ran out. Shortly after, the price of using the Mallet's power manifested itself: the entire castle turned upside-down, and they presumably descended into [[Gensokyo]] afterwards and joined the oni, also leading to the eventual forgetting of the inchlings by those living in the outside world. Afterwards, the Mallet was never spoken of again.

Before the main events of ''[[Double Dealing Character]]'', Shinmyoumaru was a normal inchling living in the Shining Needle Palace, unaware as to the history of the inchling race, as well as to the Miracle Mallet. However, Seija Kijin eventually approached her with the Mallet she had found, and asked her to use it. By falsifying the history of the inchlings and placing the blame for the race's destruction on powerful youkai, Seija was able to convince her to rally to her side, and to use the Mallet for what is ultimately Seija's own ambition.

==Character Design==
[[File:FS_Shinmyoumaru_Sukuna.png|150px|thumb|right|Shinmyoumaru as she appears in ''[[Forbidden Scrollery]]''.]]
===Origin===
The Inchling Princess is based on Issun-Boushi (literally, "One Sun Boy"), the Inchling from a series of Japanese fairy tales. He was swallowed by the youkai in some versions while trying to rescue a girl kidnapped by an oni, but managed to free himself and the girl and put the oni to flight by poking him from the inside with his needle until he spat him out again. In this sense, the story is a typical encounter between a big, strong, but also stupid, and a small, clever being. In some versions, Issun-Boushi carries a needle and uses a bowl as a boat and chopsticks as a paddle.

===Name===
Her full name is {{nihongo|''Shinmyoumaru Sukuna''|少名 針妙丸}}. Her surname {{nihongo||少名|Sukuna}} literally means "name/fame with a little volume". The meaning of the kanji "{{lang|ja|少}}" or word "'''sukuna'''i" is "a little," or "with a little volume", but it originally meant "young" in ancient times. So "Sukuna" can be interpreted as "young" or "tiny likely in young age". This name is borrowed from {{nihongo|"Sukunabikona"|少名毘古那, 少彦名}} or its other honorific name {{nihongo|"Sukuna mi-kami"|少名御神}}, the small [[god]] who created and ordered the land of Izumo with Ookuninushi in Japanese mythology.

Her given name {{nihongo||針妙丸|Shinmyoumaru}} can be roughly translated as "Needle Strange Ball." "Shin," or "needle," is what her character model, Issun-boushi, used for [[oni]]'s termination. "Myou" means "strange/unnatural", but in the ancient era "elegant/moderate/vague." The kanji of "Shinmyou" is ZUN's original spelling, but it can also be written "{{lang|ja|神妙}}", meaning "mysterious/very serious." The "-maru" in her name is a suffix for boys in the medieval era. This therefore could interpret her given name as "mysterious boy with a needle".

===Design===
In ''[[Double Dealing Character]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s official art Shinmyoumaru has short lavender hair, and eyes that appear to be lavender with brown flecks. She wears a pink [[wikipedia:Kimono|Kimono]] with a pinstripe pattern, some flowers, and a black ''Obi''. She has a black bowl covering her head with a flower-patterned border. In her left hand she carries the [[wikipedia:Uchide no kozuchi|Miracle Mallet]], and in her right hand, a sewing needle that shines, hence the name "''Shining Needle Sword''". The bowl, mallet and needle are the iconic possessions of [[wikipedia:Issun-bōshi|Issun-boushi]], and her design is largely based on him. The Miracle Mallet's power forms a circle around her, representing how the mallet takes payment equivalent to the wishes it grants. She doesn't wear any kind of footwear. She appears to be the size of a small child in-game. This is due to the Miracle Mallet's power, however. In several endings, she is shown to be only a few inches tall once its power wears off.

In ''[[Urban Legend in Limbo]]'', Shinmyoumaru's eyes are now red. She replaces her bowl hat with a larger, flatter, unpatterned saucer, and now uses a similar bowl as a vehicle. The magical circle around her is no longer present. This same appearance would later carry over to ''[[Antinomy of Common Flowers]]''.

==Story==
===Games===
;''Double Dealing Character''
[[File:Th14ShinmyomaruSprite.png|frame|Shinmyoumaru's sprite in ''DDC'']]
:{{Main|Double Dealing Character/Story/Reimu A's Scenario#Stage 6|l1=Reimu A Arc}}
Shinmyoumaru believes that Reimu is one of her allies as her purification rod has some of her miracle mallet's power and tells Reimu about how her purification rod is not happy with her. She asks Reimu to help her overthrow society, but Reimu refuses and fights her.
:{{Main|Double Dealing Character/Story/Reimu B's Scenario#Stage 6|l1=Reimu B Arc}}
Reimu came to stop Shinmyoumaru from overthrowing society. She tells Reimu that she is causing the social upheaval because the inchlings have been ignored.
:{{Main|Double Dealing Character/Story/Marisa A's Scenario#Stage 6|l1=Marisa A Arc|Double Dealing Character/Story/Marisa B's Scenario#Stage 6|l2=Marisa B Arc}}
Shinmyoumaru asks Marisa if she is there to help her "turn the world upside-down", and that her heart longs for power. Marisa is only there to stop her, though, so the two do battle.
:{{Main|Double Dealing Character/Story/Sakuya A's Scenario#Stage 6|l1=Sakuya A Arc}}
When Sakuya arrives, she realizes that her knife is something that she had experimentally turned into a tsukumogami. She is awash with joy at Sakuya's kind-heartedness, but the two are ultimately on opposite sides, so Shinmyoumaru begins the battle.
:{{Main|Double Dealing Character/Story/Sakuya B's Scenario#Stage 6|l1=Sakuya B Arc}}
Like in the Sakuya A arc, Shinmyoumaru misunderstands the maid's intentions and is extremely happy a human would support her. Again, Sakuya is a member of the "ruling class", so the two fight each other.

;''Impossible Spell Card''
:{{Main|Impossible Spell Card#Story|l1=Impossible Spell Card: Story}}
Later on when Seija has strong [[human]]s and [[youkai]] trying to capture her thank to the [[tengu]]'s newspaper, Shinmyoumaru confronts her and declares that she should return the remainder of the Mallet's magic and that they've lost the war. Seija believing that using her cheaty magic to concur [[Gensokyo]], Shinmyoumaru states that they ought to surrender because she has had enough. Since Seija goes against her will, she goes against Seija and gets others to capture her, becoming one of the many to try and stop Seija. She uses [[spell card]]s that are considered impossible to dodge.

;''Urban Legend in Limbo''
{{stub|section}}
Shinmyoumaru attacks every person who thinks could have Occult Balls until gathering seven. When she accomplished that, [[Mamizou Futatsuiwa]] appears and tells her that she can't use the balls to get bigger. However, Sukuna decides to keep going to investigate what the balls do. That's when she meets [[Sumireko Usami]], who scares her.

;''Antinomy of Common Flowers''
Shinmyoumaru is seen partnered with many different characters, on both the master and slave side. In the end she settles on [[Tenshi Hinanawi]] as her ideal partner. The two aim to be the strongest Perfect Posession users. They eventually encounter a second Shinmyoumaru, this one from the [[Dream World]]. The dream Shinmyoumaru swaps herself with the real Shinmyoumaru, unbeknown to Tenshi at first. [[Yukari Yakumo]] takes notice of this technique as the last piece to the puzzle of defeating the culprits behind Perfect Posession.

===Literature===
;''Forbidden Scrollery''
In chapter 12, Shinmyoumaru is interrogated by Marisa and Reimu when both saw books that seemed to be alive in the [[Suzunaan]] shop. They asked her if it could be because of the Mallet power, to which Sukuna responds affirmatively, claiming that maybe they could face some changes but that they will return to normal quickly. When Marisa asks her the reason why the books seems to got more power than other tsukumogamis and for more time, Sukuna theorizes that perhaps they found another power, as other tsukumogamis like [[Raiko Horikawa]], [[Benben Tsukumo]] or [[Yatsuhashi Tsukumo]]. 

At the end, she was right, and Marisa exterminates the culprit, a Kutsutsura, and the books return to normal shortly after.

==Relationships==
===Seija Kijin===
[[Seija Kijin]] initially comes to Shinmyoumaru to give her the Miracle Mallet and convince her to overturn society with her. They were allies during [[Double Dealing Character]], but while Shinmyoumaru gave up in overturning society after her defeat, Seija kept following her plans and "stole" some of the Miracle Mallet's power, using it during [[Impossible Spell Card]]. Since Shinmyoumaru wanted her power back, she went out hunting the amanojaku together with many others humans and youkai.

Despite what happened during the amanojaku incident, it turned out that the two are still on good terms with one another, as shown when Shinmyoumaru relied on Seija to hijack the [[The_Grimoire_of_Usami|Hakurei Fireworks Contest]].

===[[Reimu Hakurei]]===
After Shinmyoumaru was defeated, she reverted to her original one-inch size. Reimu realized that Shinmyoumaru could face harm in this state, and provided her with a small cage for her to lodge in whilst the mallet was recharging. She eventually returned to her castle, but it seems she is a regular lodger at the shrine, and the two get along well.

===Minor Relationships===
;[[Benben Tsukumo]] and [[Yatsuhashi Tsukumo]]
The two tsukumogami are also in on the conspiracy, but it's unknown if they know each other at all.
;[[Okina Matara]]
Okina helped Shinmyoumaru with her plans to hijack the fireworks festival in [[The Grimoire of Usami]].

Stage 6 Boss - Descendant of the Inchlings&lt;br /&gt;
Sukuna Shinmyoumaru

Species: Inchling&lt;br /&gt;
Ability: Using the Miracle Mallet

A descendant of Issun-Boushi.&lt;br /&gt;
She's able to use the Miracle Mallet.

Her ancestor Issun-Boushi exterminated an oni, and obtained the oni's treasure, the "Miracle Mallet".&lt;br /&gt;
That ancestor used it to gain a large body and a princess, just as the stories say.&lt;br /&gt;
He didn't use the Miracle Mallet for anything more than that.

The Miracle Mallet was an oni's tool, and the miracles it caused were also a result of the oni's power.&lt;br /&gt;
Using it recklessly would bring ruin upon oneself, he thought.


However, after several generations passed, Issun-Boushi's mindset soon faded away.&lt;br /&gt;
Then, at one point, an incident occurred.

The Miracle Mallet can grant any wish imaginable-- so why aren't we using it?&lt;br /&gt;
One of Issun-Boushi's descendants thought this, and at last broke the taboo.&lt;br /&gt;
They lived in the lap of luxury thanks to the mallet's magic power, and then made one final wish.

"I want to build a luxurious castle, and rule over the people!"

In a flash, a castle called the "Shining Needle Castle" appeared, as the Miracle Mallet's power ran out.&lt;br /&gt;
And then, tragedy struck.

The Shining Needle Castle turned on its head, and was confined to the world of the oni, taking the entire inchling race with it.&lt;br /&gt;
They sank down to a world where the people they wanted to rule over didn't exist...&lt;br /&gt;
Thus, the existence of the inchlings passed out of human knowledge.

The Miracle Mallet was an oni's tool.&lt;br /&gt;
In exchange for granting a wish, it would extract a payment equivalent to it.&lt;br /&gt;
A wish that was too big could have its payment occur even before being granted.

The inchlings realized this,&lt;br/&gt;
and the Miracle Mallet was sealed once more.


A long time passed since then, and we now come to the present day.&lt;br /&gt;
All the people among the inchlings who spoke of the past had long since passed away.&lt;br /&gt;
As a result, Shinmyoumaru Sukuna didn't know about the mallet.

An amanojaku, Seija, then laid eyes upon her.&lt;br /&gt;
In order to satisfy her ambition, Seija planned to utilize the Miracle Mallet.&lt;br /&gt;
Because only the inchlings could wield the mallet,&lt;br /&gt;
she decided to use Shinmyoumaru, who knew nothing of it.

A humiliation suffered by the inchlings, the power of the Miracle Mallet, and the youkai of Gensokyo who were responsible for that humiliation--&lt;br /&gt;
Seija was always a well-spoken amanojaku, but she fed Shinmyoumaru a false history.&lt;br /&gt;
The two of them swore to take revenge.


"Now, let's build a paradise where the weak won't be disposed of!"


However, Shinmyoumaru still didn't know about the Miracle Mallet's price.

{{nihongo|'''Shion Yorigami'''|依神  紫苑|Yorigami Shion}} is a poverty [[god]] and one of the main antagonists of ''[[Antinomy of Common Flowers]]''. Together with her younger sister, [[Joon Yorigami|Joon]], she robs innocent residents of Gensokyo of their wealth by bringing them misfortune.

==General Information==
===Personality===
Due to her power making her constantly cursed with misfortune, when Shion is first introduced she had become a quiet, uncaring and submissive person, not really caring about being bossed around and berated by her younger sister. However, it seems that deep down, she wants to forge her own identity and be important in her own right, and after the events of ''[[Antinomy of Common Flowers]]'' she seems to have become independent of her sister, loitering around with [[Tenshi Hinanawi]] instead. Occasionally, she can become more passionate and suddenly start to stand up for herself, which usually coincides with releasing an enormous aura of misfortune into her surroundings. So great is her misfortune, that even just being able to eat and drink something that everyone else considers extremely disgusting makes her incredibly happy.&lt;ref name="WaHH45"&gt;[[Wild and Horned Hermit]] - Chapter 45&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abilities===
As a poverty goddess, Shion brings misfortune to others, but is also constantly cursed with misfortune herself since she stores it inside her own body. As more and more misfortune is stored up, it'll explode at regular intervals; at this time, Shion turns into a super poverty god who scatters bad luck all around. Through Perfect Possession, she used this power to make Joon's opponents so unlucky that they'd lose for absolutely no reason. The only one unaffected by this power seems to be Tenshi Hinanawi, whose natural good luck has been considered to be inexhaustible by the poverty goddess. Since the misfortune also affects Shion, she seems to be unable to win any fight by herself, and even outside battles, absolutely anything she is involved with always ends badly for her and anyone else involved. When she planned a couple of banquets with Tenshi, all the food and drinks were disgusting, and all the participants, including Tenshi, became sick or had other problems.&lt;ref name="WaHH45"/&gt;

==Character Design==
===Origin===
Shion is a {{nihongo|Poverty goddess|貧乏神|binbougami}}. They generally assume a form of elderly beggar, going home to home and asking for entrance. People who welcome the Binbougami to their home will be struck in misfortune. They could, however, be repelled by invoking the {{nihongo|Fortune God|福神|fukujin}} to counteract the curse. They are fond of [[w:miso|Miso]], a paste made from Fermented Beans.

===Name===
Her full name is {{nihongo|'''Shion Yorigami'''|依神　紫苑}}. ''Shion'' (紫苑) comes from ''harujion'' (春紫苑), the Japanese word for the [[wikipedia:Erigeron philadelphicus|Philadelphia fleabane]]. &lt;ref&gt;''[[Strange Creators of Outer World]]'' 2018 Spring! - [[Strange Creators of Outer World/Antinomy of Common Flowers Interview with ZUN x Iruka Unabara|Antinomy of Common Flower Interview with ZUN and Iruka Unabara]]&lt;/ref&gt; The flower is nicknamed as {{nihongo|'''Poverty Grass'''|貧乏草}} in which gives an emphasis to her status as a poverty goddess. Philadelphia fleabane is closely related to [[wikipedia:Erigeron annuus|daisy fleabane]], called in Japanese as {{nihongo|'''himejoon'''|姫女苑}}, is the flower that is likely what her sister Joon is named after, thus reflecting their relationship as siblings. Interestingly enough, both the Philadelphia Fleabane and Daisy Fleabane is considered as an [[w: Invasive species|Invasive Species]] in Japan and disregarded as weeds on its native land of North America, just as the Yorigami sisters have a reputation for being two of the most despicable inhabitants of [[Gensokyo]]. In addition to that, the birth order of Yorigami sisters mayhaps influenced by the flower they are named after, as Philadelphia Fleabane usually blooms first around April and May, while Daisy Fleabane tends to bloom a few months later. On its own, ''Shion'' is also the Japanese word for ''[[wikipedia:Aster tataricus|Tatarian Aster]]''. Her family name ''Yorigami'' is composed of the kanji 依, which means "reliant" or "dependent", and 神, which means "god". The first kanji is also present in the term ''hyoui'' (憑依) meaning "possession", so it is possible that ''Yorigami'' could mean "possession god".

===Design===
Shion has blue eyes and dark blue hair that flows as if it were a flame with a ribbon on top. She wears a gray short-sleeved hoodie and a blue semi-transparent skirt. All her clothes are randomly decorated with what appears to bills depicting debt and eviction notices. On both her wrists there are golden bracelets. She is also seen carrying a small broken beggar's cup and a small, patched-up doll of what appears to be a cat. She is completely barefoot.
One of her legs appears to be surrounded by a blue spirit-like flame. In some animations, she appears to lose (or hide) both legs and gain a blue ghost-like tail.

==Appearances==
;''Antimony of Common Flowers''
Along with her sister, they plan to rob the atendees of a Prismriver concert. Many people try to stop them, but due to Shions power they are unable to win. Yukari eventually figures out a way to defeat them and battles them with Reimu, winning.
[[File:Th175ShionSprite.gif|thumb|frame|right|120px|Shion's sprite in ''GI'']]
;''Touhou Gouyoku ibun''
In [[Kanako]]’s Scenario, Kanako realises that both of them had being recollecting as much petroleum as they could with the intention of getting rich, and she calls them egoists for that. Later, they call her poor and fight against her, only to be defeated.

In [[Minamitsu]]’s scenario, both of them call the phantom poor after she said she didn’t know what petroleum was, and they attack her after knowing she wants to stop the incident.

In their scenario, Joon and Shion go after more petroleum to get richer. After fighting Kanako, Joon enters in a backdoor in her back, and she is followed by Shion. They arrived to the [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]], where they fight [[Flandre Scarlet]]. After winning against the vampire, they enter again a door and they get out of [[Yuuma Toutetsu]]’s back, who they fight for the the “petroleum” from the [[Hell of Blood Pools]].

===Literature===
;''Wild and Horned Hermit''
In chapter 45, both [[Tenshi Hinanawi]] and Shion took care of the banquet [[Reimu Hakurei]] and [[Marisa Kirisame]] were hosting. Although [[Kasen Ibaraki]] tried to convince Tenshi to throw the idea, she could not and got scolded by Shion for “insulting” the food.
Everybody complained about how awful the food was, but the constant praises of Shion about it made them eat it anyways. The next morning, everybody suffered the effects of that indigestible food.

However, Tenshi promised another banquet, so Kasen this time tried to convince them using another perspective, which worked, and everybody had a real banquet. Nevertheless, the poverty god was there too and her effect made everybody sick the next morning anyway.

==Relationships==
;[[Joon Yorigami]]
Shion's younger sister. Joon is a plague god that uses her powers to make others spend all their money and give it to her. Although Shion was fundamental for Joon's scheme during the events of ''Antinomy of Common Flowers'', she seems to not hold Shion in high regard, as she often berates her and heavily insults her as soon as they get cornered by [[Yukari Yakumo]] and [[Reimu Hakurei]], calling her a "gloomy, poor, smelly, miser who can't do anything on her own", &lt;ref&gt; ''[[Antinomy of Common Flowers]]'' - [[Yukari]]'s Scenario &lt;/ref&gt; and saying how there isn't anything good about her.

;[[Tenshi Hinanawi]]
A [[celestial]] with apparently inextinguishable good luck, unaffected by Shion's misfortune and that became her friend after she realized that the poverty goddess' misfortune wouldn't affect her. Since, unlike everyone else, the celestial doesn't mind being near her, Shion thinks someone like Tenshi can finally make her feel happy. After almost a year after the Perfect Possession incident, the two are still seen spending time together in Gensokyo, even organizing a couple of banquets at the [[Hakurei Shrine]]. Shion seems to care a lot about Tenshi, almost starting to cry when she thought Tenshi was angry with her due to a headache. &lt;ref name="WaHH45"/&gt;

==Additional Information==
*According to [[Febri/Wild and Horned Hermit ending interview with ZUN and Aya Azuma|ZUN and Aya Azuma on an interview]], Shion's existence was shown implicitly before her official appearance at [[Antinomy of Common Flowers]] (Dec. 29th, 2017); Reimu does her best and it turns back to poverty on chapter 43 of [[Wild and Horned Hermit]] "&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Hakurei Shrine Cannot Make A Profit&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;" (Dec. 26th, 2017). — It first seems to readers that this is the inherent attribute of Reimu or Hakurei Shrine, but in fact, Shion already settled down there.
*Joon, along with Shion, are the only final boss consisting of two characters.

Shion Yorigami

Species: Poverty god&lt;br&gt;
Ability: Capable of making people unlucky, including herself

A poverty god who reduces people's luck and makes them poor upon possessing them, who is thus hated by everyone.&lt;br&gt;
Abject and gloomy. Would rather let other people take care of things for her.

She herself will remain destitute no matter where she goes, so she doesn't try to put in any effort, and is apathetic.

Where does all of the lost wealth and good luck go?&lt;br&gt;
They're actually converted into debt and bad luck, respectively, and continually stored inside her body.&lt;br&gt;
As more and more is stored up, it'll explode at regular intervals; at this time, she turns into a super poverty god who scatters bad luck all around.

However, she's actually a sort of guardian god, who protects people from dramatic financial ruin by reducing their overall wealth.&lt;br&gt;
Although she's still hated in the end, of course...

This time around, in order to escape from poverty, she decided to possess her gaudy spendthrift of a younger sister.&lt;br&gt;
Her sister can't save up money either, though, so she remained poor as ever.

{{nihongo|'''[[Wikipedia:ja:仙台四郎|Shirou Sendai]]'''|仙台 四郎}} was a real person from [[Wikipedia:Sendai|Sendai City]] who brought good fortune to the businesses that he visited. After his death he became known as a [[god]].

He rarely speaks and is always smiling. However, he will not come to places that will go out of business.

==General Information==
===Occupation===
Shirou Sendai is a god who brings good fortune to the stores he visits.

==Character Design==
===Name===
His family name "Sendai" ({{lang|ja|仙台}}) is the name of location. On the other hand, his personal name "Shirou" is an ordinary name for the fourth son; "{{lang|ja|四}}" is a cardinal number "4" and "{{lang|ja|郎}}" is, in this case, "man".

===Design===
The humans of the village who have seen Sendai Shiro say they saw a human resembling a [[Wikipedia:Fukusuke|Fukusuke]] doll according to Marisa's information.

==Story==
In ''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'', a figure referred to by the humans of the village as the god of good fortune begins appearing in stores. Any store that this god had visited will attain great fortune in business. Word of this god reaches the [[Hakurei Shrine]] and [[Reimu]] plans to kidnap him in order to attract visitors to her shrine. [[Sanae]] points out that he may be Sendai Shirou who became a true god due to the distinct similarities between the two.

==Relationships==
Sendai Shirou became the talk all around the [[human]]s in the village as they all try to attract him to their stores to obtain good fortune.

==Additional Information==
*[[Marisa Kirisame]] comments that this isn't a god that existed long before.
*[[Kasen]] reveals that this god purposely visits stores that are doing great business to guarantee good fortune to the store. In the end the good fortune comes from not the god, but the hard work of the business owners.
**This strategy may be a way for this god to obtain faith.
*Shirou's real name is {{nihongo|"Shirou Haga"|芳賀四郎}}.
*Shirou Sendai has some points similar to [[Wikipedia:Fukusuke|Fukusuke]]; they are real people, can't speak owing to their intellectual disability, always smiles, and brings good fortune to stores.

{{nihongo|'''Shizuha Aki'''|秋 静葉|Aki Shizuha}} is the goddess of autumn leaves and thus has the power to control the turning of the leaves. She is [[Minoriko Aki]]'s older sister and together they have the ability to control autumn.

==General Information==
Shizuha first appeared in ''[[Mountain of Faith]]'' being a [[stage]] 1 [[Boss|midboss]]. She then later appear as a target in ''[[Double Spoiler]]'' and in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'' as a background character.

===Personality===
She believes that the autumn colors of the turning leaves are the best thing about autumn, and is filled with a sense of superiority when she shows the beauty of the leaves to her sister. She becomes sorrowful and pessimistic as winter approaches.

===Abilities===
;Controlling the turning of leaves
Surprisingly, she doesn't use supernatural powers to turn the leaves red. Instead she "paints" them by hand, which is why the colors of the leaves are inconsistent.&lt;ref name="SoPM_Shizuha"/&gt; Fallen leaves are another part of her work. Instead of dropping leaves moderately, she simply kicks on the trees and scatters them roughly.&lt;ref name="SoPM_Shizuha"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DS_SC1_3"/&gt;

===Occupation===
She is the [[god]]dess of autumn leaves, and with her sister, who is the goddess of harvest, they control autumn. Together they're not the best at fighting, but when someone is disrupting autumn they punish that person.

It is difficult for her to gather faith, which makes it a bit challenging to distinguish her from a normal [[youkai]]. However, goddesses of autumn leaves appear to be pretty rare, so she doesn't have the problem of competition that her sister Minoriko faces.

==Character Design==
[[File:ThGKAki.png|thumb|200px|Shizuha, as illustrated in ''[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]]'']]
===Name===
Her name is {{nihongo|''Shizuha Aki''|秋 静葉}}. The character for {{nihongo||秋|Aki}} means "Autumn", and {{nihongo||静葉|Shizuha}} means {{nihongo|"quiet"|静}} and {{nihongo|"leaves"|葉}}.

===Design===
Shizuha has yellow-orange eyes and short blond hair with red autumn leaves in her ''Mountain of Faith'' official art. She wears a long red-orange dress with darker red at her middle and arms and more orange towards the bottom and ends with leaf-shaped cut-outs around. There is a white collar at the top of the dress. Under the white collar there is something what resembles a nametag, with three buttons next to it. She has white socks and black shoes.

==Appearances==
===Games===
;''Mountain of Faith''
[[File:Th10ShizuhaSprite.png|frame|Shizuha's sprite in ''MoF'']]
Shizuha was under the impression that the heroine in ''[[Mountain of Faith]]'' was coming to disrupt autumn, which prompted her to attack. But she was easily defeated, however, being a mere first-[[stage]] midboss.

===Spin-offs===
;''Double Spoiler''
[[File:Th135Shizuha.png|frame|Shizuha in ''HM'']]
In ''[[Double Spoiler]]'', Shizuha appeared as a stage 1 target, where she uses a few [[spell card]]s and had [[Aya Shameimaru]] and [[Hatate Himekaidou]] take photos of her and her [[danmaku]].

;''Hopeless Masquerade''
Shizuha made a background cameo appearance in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'' on the [[Genbu Ravine]] and [[Youkai Tanuki Forest]] stage. She is seen with her sister [[Minoriko Aki]] cheering.

==Relationships==
===[[Minoriko Aki]]=== 
Minoriko is her younger sister. Together they control [[Gensokyo]]'s fall season. Shizuha often brags about how beautiful she makes the leaves look, but is also jealous about Minoriko's popularity with humans as a harvest goddess.

{{nihongo|'''Shou Toramaru'''|寅丸　星|Toramaru Shou}} is a disciple of the god [[Bishamonten]]. Along with [[Minamitsu Murasa]] and the other [[youkai]] aboard the Palanquin Ship, she seeks to revive [[Byakuren Hijiri]] after she had been sealed away in [[Makai]] by [[human]]s.

==General Information==
Shou is a tiger youkai lives at the [[Myouren Temple]] as the avatar of Bishamonten. Technically, though she is Byakuren's disciple as a high-ranking priest, the fact that she is Bishamonten's avatar essentially means that she is worshiped by Byakuren. As she attracts wealth, she is one of the only things that draws any humans to the predominantly youkai-inhabited temple in the first place. It has been said that she resembles statues of Bishamonten, though she doesn't look like him at all.

===Personality===
In public, Shou remains gentle, composed, and dignified. However, when around closer friends, she has been known to show more emotion. She has apparently even flown into a rage a few times. She is also a heavy drinker, though the Buddhist faith prohibits that.

===Abilities===
;Gathering treasures
Shou's ability allows her to gather treasures. After she has gathered precious gems, she can use their radiance in combination with the Jeweled Pagoda to fire lasers that can reduce anything to ashes. Moreover, if she fires those lasers at the ground, more gems will be created. Anyway, most of Shou's power comes from this pagoda alone, and she doesn't have much in the way of physical ability.

===Occupation===
Shou spends her time as a high-ranking priest at the [[Myouren Temple]]. Her actual duties are unknown, but as the avatar of Bishamonten, those at the temple worship her.

===Possessions===
Shou carries Bishamonten's Pagoda, which manifests her ability to bring about wealth. She also carries a long spear, but it's mostly for decorative purposes. She uses it to appear more dignified, and also as a walking stick.

==Backstory==
Shou was born as a "tiger youkai", not from an actual [[tiger]] (which are not native to Japan), but from the fear created by stories about tigers that had spread there. As such, her existence originally depended on the people of Japan remaining ignorant about what real tigers were like.

While Byakuren was still a famous [[monk]] in the [[outside world]], she scouted Shou to become a disciple of the god Bishamonten (whom the monk currently worshipped) because she was a youkai, in order for Byakuren to gain the trust of the youkai living on the mountain. Shou, meanwhile, hid the fact that she was a youkai from humans. Bishamonten also assigned Shou a servant, a mouse youkai named [[Nazrin]], not only to assist her but also to keep an eye on her. As the years passed, Shou proved herself a more-than-worthy disciple, and Nazrin's role solidified as her subject. Having a more solid identity as Bishamonten's avatar also prevented Shou from fading away.

After Byakuren was sealed away, Shou couldn't do much - if she had tried to do something, the fact that she was a youkai would have been revealed - so she continued serving Bishamonten. However, hundreds of years later, she, Murasa, Ichirin, and Nazrin appeared above-ground in Gensokyo, where they vowed to rescue Byakuren at all costs.

==Character Design==
[[Image:ThGKShou.png|thumb|200px|Shou as seen in ''[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]]'']]
===Origin===
Her appearance seems to be based upon that of [[Bishamonten]], the Japanese Buddhist god based on the Indian God [[Wikipedia:Vaisravana|Vaisravana]]. Bishamonten is often depicted holding a spear and a small pagoda. This is derived from the fact that Chougosonshi Temple ({{lang|ja|朝護孫子寺}}), which keeps the [[Wikipedia:Emakimono|e-maki]] of Myouren's tales ([[Wikipedia:Shigisan-engi|Shigisan Engi Emaki]]), enshrines Bishamonten. Originally the tiger had few symbolic ties to Bishamonten, but became more relevant in the [[Wikipedia:Asuka period|Asuka period]] when the main Buddhist faction, [[Wikipedia:Prince Shōtoku|Prince Shōtoku]] and the [[Wikipedia:Soga clan|Soga clan]], were able to subdue the anti-Buddhist [[Wikipedia:Mononobe clan|Mononobe clan]] because Bishamonten appeared to support them on the hour of the tiger on the day of the tiger in the year of the tiger ({{lang|ja|寅の年、寅の日、寅の刻}}) of the Chinese zodiac. Now, many tigers can be seen at Chougosonshi Temple. [http://www.sigisan.or.jp/ Their website] also shows how they raise them.

In addition to that, the tiger motif have been inspired by one of Vaisravana's frequent companions in artistic depictions and sutras, an unidentified man wearing a tiger skin. She may also have been inspired by his usual mount, a lion, but, as lions are only vaguley related to tigers, this seems unlikely.

===Name===
Her full name is {{nihongo|''Shou Toramaru''|寅丸　星}}. {{nihongo||寅丸|Toramaru}} can be literally translated as "tiger circle". However, the word "maru" is also used to end the names of ships in Japan, which is fitting, considering one of the main aspects of ''[[Undefined Fantastic Object]]'' is the "treasure ship". {{nihongo||寅|tora}} can be used to refer the tiger as a sign in the [[Wikipedia:Chinese zodiac#East Asia|Chinese Zodiac]], which carries with it the additional meanings of a period of time from 3AM to 5AM, the direction [[Wikipedia:File:Brosen windrose.svg|East by Northeast]], or January. {{nihongo||星|Shou}} means "star", which is also fitting considering the extraterrestrial implications given by the game's title.

Shou's name was misspelled as "{{lang|ja|'''虎'''丸 星}}" in the [[Undefined Fantastic Object/Music#Stage 5 Boss - Shou Toramaru's theme|music comments]]. This kanji can refer to tigers, felines of the "''Panthera tigris''" species, or colloquially, a "drunk person".

===Design===
Shou has orange-yellow hair with black stripes in it and golden yellow eyes. She wears a lotus-shaped ornament on her head, has a giant cloth circle attached to her back, and carries a giant spear in her left hand and the jeweled pagoda of [[wikipedia:Vaisravana|Bishamonten]] in her right. She wears a burgundy/orange/white dress with a tiger pattern around the abdomen along with white, frilly pants under her dress and black shoes on her feet.

==Appearances==
;''Undefined Fantastic Object''
[[File:Th12ShouSprite.png|frame|Shou's sprite in ''UFO'']]
In ''Undefined Fantastic Object'', she is a member of the group looking around for the two treasures needed in order to revive Byakuren: the fragments of the Flying Storehouse, and the pagoda of Bishamonten. She sends Nazrin to find the latter. After the palanquin ship enters Makai, she encounters the heroine; with the two needed treasures now together, she could proceed with Byakuren's revival. For one reason or another, however, she is attacked and beaten by the heroine, who then opts to unseal Byakuren either out of curiosity or real concern.

;''Double Spoiler''
[[File:Th135Shou.png|frame|Shou in ''HM'']]
In ''[[Double Spoiler]]'', Shou appears on [[stage]] 7 as a target, where [[Aya Shameimaru]] and [[Hatate Himekaidou]] take photos of her and her [[spell card]].

;''Hopeless Masquerade''
Shou made a background cameo appearance in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'' on the [[Myouren Temple]] stage and [[Youkai Tanuki Forest]] [[stage]]. She is seen standing around.

==Relationships==
;[[Byakuren Hijiri]]
Shou is on good terms with Byakuren, and felt extremely bad that her role kept her from going to rescue the monk. After appearing in Gensokyo, she created a plan to unseal her. The two now share a complex relationship - Shou is Byakuren's disciple, but because she is Bishamonten's avatar, she's also worshiped by her.
;[[Nazrin]], [[Minamitsu Murasa]], [[Ichirin Kumoi]] &amp; [[Bishamonten]] 
Nazrin is essentially Shou's underling. The fact that they've been together for hundreds of years shows trust in her servant to not tell Murasa or Ichirin that she had lost the pagoda, which most likely would have been embarrassing, being the prodigious disciple of Bishamonten.

==Additional Information==
*Shou's ability is listed as "gathering treasures", but ironically she herself did not gather any of the needed treasure to unseal Byakuren; instead, Nazrin found the pagoda, and the heroine found the fragments of Flying Storehouse. The only real reference to this ability is in her final spell card in [[Double Spoiler]].
*Shou also possesses a mandala, a symbolic object of Buddhism, according to Double Spoiler.
*In her official profile, as well as in her dialogue, Shou is characterized as very honest and straightforward.

| translation = ○Stage 5 Boss　　'''Disciple of Bishamonten'''&lt;br /&gt;
'''Shou Toramaru'''

Species: youkai&lt;br&gt;
Ability: Gathering treasures

A youkai representing good fortune. &lt;br&gt;
Byakuren, long a devotee Bishamonten, thought to call him to her temple,&lt;br&gt;
but the god was very busy, and was almost never there.

Byakuren realized that the youkai near the temple had been afraid.&lt;br&gt;
It seemed that they feared Bishamonten.&lt;br&gt;
Perhaps they thought they would be exterminated.

With Bishamonten too busy to visit the temple, and the youkai too scared to approach it,&lt;br&gt;
Byakuren hatched a clever plan.&lt;br&gt;
She introduced to Bishamonten the youkai of the most honest and upright character on the mountain&lt;br&gt;
and had that youkai gather faith in his stead.

The one so chosen was Shou. She was a youkai in the form of a tiger and the most trusted youkai on the mountain.&lt;br&gt;
The busy Bishamonten did not deny her his discipleship.

However, she hadn't yet earned the god's full confidence, and Bishamonten sent his hench-mouse&lt;br&gt;
Nazrin to keep watch on her.

But contrary Bishamonten's concerns, Shou caused no problems whatever.&lt;br&gt;
She proved to be an excellent servant.

But she was perhaps too excellent.&lt;br&gt;
When Byakuren was sealed away, Shou dutifully carried out all her duties in Bishamonten's service without causing any disturbance.&lt;br&gt;
She kept it a secret from the humans that she was a youkai.&lt;br&gt;
She had her regrets about this, but revealing her true identity would have been suicidal.

During the few hundreds centuries following Byakuren's disapearence, the temple fell to ruin,&lt;br&gt;
and her companions, who had been sealed away in the depths of the earth, made their return.

Shou was tired of her regrets.  She would not run away.&lt;br&gt;
She told Murasa and the others how to lift the seal. She was a youkai, after all.&lt;br&gt;
She wanted to put all her power into bringing Byakuren back.

"To break the seal, we'll need the power of Byakuren's brother Myouren.&lt;br&gt;
All that's left are a flying warehouse and the floating treasures...&lt;br&gt;
Murasa, let's take the ship and go look for it!"

'''SinGyoku''' appears as [[Reimu Hakurei]] approaches the gates to [[Hell]] and [[Makai]] in ''[[Highly Responsive to Prayers]]'', where the two battle. Next to nothing is known about this enemy, as it does not exchange dialog with Reimu and has no official profile. Judging from its appearance, SinGyoku is likely related in some way to the [[Hakurei Shrine]].

==Character Design==
===Name===
Its name is ''SinGyoku''. There is no official [[wikipedia:Kana|kana]] of SinGyoku, however it is commonly written in the Japanese fanbase as {{nihongo||シンギョク|Shingyoku}}, but it is unknown whether the {{nihongo|"si"|シ}} part of the name is really prounounced "shi" or not. There is a possible kanji conversion to show {{nihongo||神玉|shingyoku}}. {{nihongo||神|Shin}} means "[[God]]" since a likely connexion is the fact that SinGyoku is shown at the [[Hakurei Shrine]], and {{nihongo||玉|Gyoku}} means "ball", a reference to its yin-yang form.

===Design===
SinGyoku seems to have three different forms from the sprites in ''[[Highly Responsive to Prayers]]'':
#a large, brown Yin-Yang with red markings. One side seems to be transparent. Has a strong resemblance to the [[Yin-Yang Orb]].
#a female priestess(?) in red robes with long, flowing red hair, horns, and glowing red eyes. 
#a male priest(?) in white and blue robes with glowing red eyes. It has a slight resemblance to a feudal [[Wikipedia:Sōhei|souhei]] or a {{nihongo|[[wikipedia:Onmyōdō#Onmyoji|onmyouji]]|陰陽師}}.

Should SinGyoku's 3rd form be a male priest, then he would be the first male character to appear in a Touhou game, with [[Genjii]] and [[Sokrates]] appearing after him. Also, SinGyoku's "male" form is one of the only [[PC-98]] characters whose hair and eyes are not the same colour. The only other PC-98 characters with this trait are [[Elis]] and [[Konngara]]. This is due to the 16-colour limit the PC-98 hardware imposes on the other PC-98 characters.

==Additional Information==
*SinGyoku is the first boss in the entire ''[[Touhou Project]]'' series.
*The [[stage enemies]] [[flying yin-yang]] from the [[Windows]] era and the [[Blood-Vessel Yin-Yang Orbs‎]] from ''[[Story of Eastern Wonderland]]'' bear a resemblance to SinGyoku's first form, as well as the [[Yin-Yang Orb]].
*[[Mononobe no Futo]] seems to look similar to SinGyoku's "male" form.
*Reimu's Boss Attack in [[Phantasmagoria of Dim. Dream]] resembles SinGyoku's first form.

{{nihongo|'''Soga no Tojiko'''|蘇我　屠自古|Soga no Tojiko}} is a [[ghost]] who first showed up as the fifth-[[stage]] [[Boss|mid-boss]] of ''[[Ten Desires]]''.

==General Information==
Tojiko is considered a [[vengeful spirit]] as she is a ghost who holds a grudge against humans. Among other vengeful spirits, she seems to be a quite powerful one. It is stated, however, in ''[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]]'', that her grudge seems to be fading away, meaning that she's steadily becoming a simple ghost that can cause thunder.

===Personality===
She is a very practical woman who can use coarse language, appearing to be a foil to [[Mononobe no Futo|Futo]]'s airheaded, jovial nature. Though she has a quick temper and her attitude is rough, she is actually a very nice person. She doesn't seem to mind being a ghost as it's convenient for her.

===Ability===
;Causing thunder
Creating thunder is a common ability for [[vengeful spirit|vengeful spirits]], and Tojiko frequently uses it when angered. As she is a powerful vengeful spirit, she can create the full effect of loud, booming thunder &lt;ref name=”SoPM”&gt; ''[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]]'' : [[Symposium of Post-mysticism/Soga no Tojiko|Soga no Tojiko]] &lt;/ref&gt;. As [[Taoism]] uses things like lightning, and since there is the borrowed power of the sorcery called the {{nihongo|"thunder rites"|雷法}}, the power to cause thunder may be a power that can be acquired and mastered as a Taoist.

Another theory is that the father of the character Tojiko is based on, Soga no Umako, built the temple {{nihongo|[[wikipedia:Gangō-ji|Gangoji]]|元興寺}}, and the youkai of Gangoji, {{nihongo|[[wikipedia:ja:元興寺 (妖怪)|Gagoze]]|元興寺}}, who was exterminated by the child granted by the lightning god to a farmer, which is commonly thought to be the basis. (The Gagouji of the [[spell card]] ''Thunder Arrow "Gagouji's Cyclone"'' (meaning "monster" in child language) is based on Gagoze, but the folkloristics scholar Kunio Yanagita denied the etymology that "Gagouji" came from "Gagoze")

[[Iku Nagae]] also used lightning, but unlike Iku, Tojiko's ability is directly related to lightning (unlike Iku's "reading the atmosphere"). Different from Iku's lightning blasts, Tojiko's lightning came in the form of jagged arrangements of arrows.

===Possessions===
In preparation to become a [[shikaisen]], Tojiko set up a jar to preserve her spirit in, much in the same way that [[Mononobe no Futo]] used a plate. However, Futo swapped the jar with an unfired one, which quickly decayed, causing Tojiko to become a ghost instead. She is not known to have any possessions at the moment.

==Character Design==
[[File:ThGKTojiko.png|thumb|200px|Tojiko illustration in ''[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]]'']]
===Origin===
The [[Wikipedia:Soga clan|Soga clan]] was a family who waged a fierce political battle with the [[wikipedia:Mononobe clan|Mononobe clan]] over Buddhism. In particular, [[Wikipedia:Soga no Umako|Soga no Umako]] and [[wikipedia:Mononobe no Moriya|Mononobe no Moriya]] were two very influential courtiers to [[Wikipedia:Emperor Bidatsu|Emperor Bidatsu]] and his brother, [[Wikipedia:Emperor Yōmei|Emperor Youmei]], who was the father of [[Wikipedia:Prince Shōtoku|Prince Shoutoku]]. Both Youmei and Shoutoku were proponents of Buddhism, which led to victory for Umako, whose forces killed Moriya and his allies in the [[Wikipedia:Battle of Shigisan|Battle of Shigisan]] in 587.

Of the Soga clan, there existed a {{nihongo|[[Wikipedia:ja:刀自古郎女|Tojiko no Iratsume]]|刀自古郎女}}, who was the daughter of Soga no Umako and a consort of [[Wikipedia:Prince Shotoku|Prince Shoutoku]], the basis for [[Toyosatomimi no Miko]], of which Tojiko no Iratsume only has has a name basis. 

The [[Wikipedia:Fujiwara clan|Fujiwara clan]] (of which [[Fujiwara no Mokou]] is based on) played an important role in taking down the Soga clan and removing the Soga clan's place as an influence to Japan as a whole. This event is known as the {{nihongo|[[Wikipedia:Isshi Incident|Isshi Incident]]|乙巳の変}}.

===Name===
Her known name is {{nihongo|''Soga no Tojiko''|蘇我　屠自古}}. Her last name {{nihongo|''Soga''|蘇我}} was taken from the Soga clan, but it can literally mean "Ego Awakening". Her first name {{nihongo|''Tojiko''|屠自古}} literally means "Your Ancient Carcass". Perhaps coincidentally, the first characters from her first name and surname, refer to {{nihongo|''tosa''|屠蘇}}, a kind of spice sake served at New Year's.

===Design===
In ''[[Ten Desires]]'''s official art, Tojiko has green hair, green eyes and a dark green dress with ofuda along the bottom. She has two ghost "tails" where her legs should be, and a {{nihongo|[[Wikipedia:ja:日本の冠|kanmuri]]|冠}}-style hat.

==Story==
===Games===
;''Ten Desires''
[[File:Th13TojikoSprite.png|frame|Tojiko's sprite in ''TD'']]
{{Main|Ten Desires/Story|l1=Story}}
Tojiko appears as the stage 5 midboss. The heroines fight her when they make it into the [[Hall of Dreams' Great Mausoleum]] before fighting [[Mononobe no Futo]]. She also reappears alongside Futo and [[Toyosatomimi no Miko]] during the final [[boss]] battle.

===Spin-offs===
[[File:Th135Tojiko.png|frame|Tojiko in ''HM'']]
;''Hopeless Masquerade''
Tojiko made a background cameo appearance in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'' on the [[Divine Spirit Mausoleum]] stage. She is seen floating around.

==Relationships==
;[[Toyosatomimi no Miko]]
Leader of the group that Tojiko follows.

;[[Mononobe no Futo]]
The Mononobe and Soga clan were enemies due to their Buddhism reception (the Mononobe clan hated it and the Soga clan defend it as a religion followed by more civilized people &lt;ref&gt; [[wikipedia:Soga clan#Connection to Buddhism from Korea and China|Soga clan connections with Buddhism]] &lt;/Ref&gt;), a rivalry that ended with the destruction of the Mononobe and the blooming of Buddhism in Japan thanks to the efforts of Soga clan.

She, [[Miko]] and [[Futo]] decided to “sleep” to become ''shikaisen'', Futo replaced the jar Tojiko chose with another which eroded after Tojiko moved her soul to it, &lt;ref name=”SoPM”/&gt;  frustrating her reincarnation with a physical body.  Although at first her grudge made her a vengeful spirit, it seems that this feeling is decaying and she is more of a simple ghost. 

===Minor relationships===
;[[Seiga Kaku]]
Tojiko's relationship with Seiga doesn't seem to be particularly close.

==Additional Information==
*Soga no Tojiko, [[Mizuchi Miyadeguchi]] and [[Mima]] are the only [[humanoid]] [[ghost]]s to have a ghost tail rather than legs. 
*The Soga clan is said to be descended from [[Wikipedia:Takenouchi no Sukune|Takenouchi no Sukune]], Emperor Kougen and Amaterasu. As such, she can be considered as "the Descendant of the Gods."
*In real history, the [[wikipedia:Soga clan|Soga clan]] was overthrown from power in 645 during a coup d'état conspired by [[wikipedia:Fujiwara no Kamatari|Nakatomi no Kamatari]], founder of the [[wikipedia:Fujiwara clan|Fujiwara clan]], among others. Kamatari was later struck and killed by lightning, which people believed to be a curse laid by the late Soga clan; this is a possible inspiration for Tojiko's ability. Also, Kamatari's son, Fujiwara no Fuhito, is the speculated model of [[Fujiwara no Mokou]]'s father.

Soga no Tojiko

Species: Ghost&lt;br/&gt;
Ability: Cause of lightning

A ghost of a member of the powerful ancient Japanese family, the Soga. She is serving Miko together with Futo, but she has been denied to resurrect as a human due to her connections with Futo in the past. It looks like she is treated conveniently by Futo taking a spirit form.

She herself isn't feeling any particular inconvenience taking the spirit form. Rather in fact, she had been considering that she had no use for a human body, which would break down so quickly.

The Soga and the Mononobe had fought over Buddhism, but Futo and Tojiko's relationship is not in bad terms, and thought to be a give-and-take relationship. For now, they both hate Buddhism.

}}

This mirror-like being was found on the border between [[Gensokyo]] and [[Makai]] and is the second stage midboss of ''[[Mystic Square]]''. After the heroine passes some ice falling, the mirror will attack the player while flying around the screen and shooting [[danmaku]] with two types of patterns. On its second attack, it'll freeze on one spot of the screen and dramatically change by loosing its wings and starts sparking, spitting danmaku. Since it's got no dialogue with the player, nothing is known about it.

==Character Design ==
===Name===
This mirror is nameless, but {{nihongo|"Spirit Mirror"|神鏡|Shinkagami}} seems to be a notable name in the Japanese community, but more notably is just referred to as {{nihongo|"MS 2nd Stage Midboss"|怪綺談二面中ボス}}. Due to it's looks however, some Western fans call this midboss the "Magic Mirror" or the "Magic Mirror Midboss", but due to the [[Dark Mirror]], it's better to refer to it as the "Magic Mirror ([[Angel]])" or the "Magic Mirror Midboss (Angel)" to avoid confusion.

===Design===
The sprite shows that it looks like a light crystal blue mirror with a cross in the centre and two stray lines from the sides of the cross connecting to the bottom of the centre (resembling a crucifix). It seems to have a frame with a dark blue and light blue pattern with [[angel]] wings.

==Additional Information==
*Its species could possibly be an [[Tsukumogami#Ungaikyo|Ungaikyo]], a type of Tsukumogami, that are living mirrors that occasionally have occult powers. They are [[demon]]s that come out of antique mirrors. 
*It might have some relation to the [[Dark Mirror]] of ''[[Lotus Land Story]]''.
*The Spirit Mirror is one of the few midbosses in the whole series that changes its attack pattern of [[danmaku]] as its health bar decreases, being the first to do this. The next to do this is the [[Trump King]].

{{nihongo|'''Star Sapphire'''|スターサファイア|Suta Safaia}} is a [[fairy]] and one of the members of the '''[[Three Fairies of Light]]''', along with [[Sunny Milk]] and [[Luna Child]]. She currently lives in a tree close to the [[Hakurei Shrine]] with her two partners. She often pranks humans along with her two partners, using her ability to sense animate objects from a distance to her advantage.

==General Information==
Star first appeared in the manga ''[[Touhou Sangetsusei]]'''s first work ''[[Eastern and Little Nature Deity]]'' as one of the three main protagonists, and had the same role throughout the sub-series. [[ZUN]] stated that the reason why he chose Star, Sunny, and Luna as main characters is because the three of them have little fighting ability, yet are much more outgoing than Rinnosuke, making them ideal characters for introducing various aspects of [[Gensokyo]]'s daily life that [[Rinnosuke Morichika]] does not participate in.{{reference needed|ZUN's statement}} She later made an appearance in a game as a [[boss]] in ''[[Fairy Wars]]'' and a background appearance in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]''.

Star, much like her partners, isn't very powerful. Her power is to sense animate objects from afar, usually allowing her to know when trouble is coming or when to act during a prank. Unlike her two partners, her power does not weaken at any time, as stars are always present in the sky, even during the day. During ''Strange and Bright Nature Deity'', Luna moves from her residence in the [[Forest of Magic]] to a new home near to the [[Hakurei Shrine]].

===Personality===
Star is often described as having more common sense than other fairies, being calmer, often avoiding fights, and letting her two partners getting caught as she is making her getaway. As her two other partners, she is rather fond of alcohol.

Unlike her partners, she has the most bizarre sense of perception. Sometimes, things that would cause Sunny and Luna to panic, such as an imminent incident or seeing a mountain of human skulls, Star seems to find fun and exciting.

Just as bizarre are also her interests, which include examining strange rocks, or keeping a mushroom bonsai tree as a hobby.

===Abilities===
;Detection of moving things
Like a radar, she is able to sense things that exist from afar. In ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'', it became "moving things", but according to her speech and conduct as well as [[Shanghai Alice Correspondence]] Three Fairies Version, she is "only able to know moving things, and unrelated to being among that, living things" (for living things, she isn't able to make distinctions other than size).

There hasn't been a depiction of concretely what range she is able to grasp things, but if she isn't preoccupied with other things, it seems that she's able to grasp a reasonably wide range, but it also seems that if there are a very large number of living things, then the important information gets buried. Also, she wasn't able to recognise [[Reisen Udongein Inaba]] who was invoking her ability.

There's hardly any instance where this ability caused direct damage in mischief, but as it's support orientated, in ''Perfect Memento in Strict Sense'', it was even written that "when she is on observation duty, she can be a threat." If Star were not to slack off, then the the three fairies' pranks would become quite nasty. That is, if she doesn't slack off.

As for recovery from injury – different from [[Sunny Milk]] and [[Luna Child]]'s case – she isn't affected at all by the weather and constantly recovers at ease. As for how she slacks off, different from the other [[youkai]] and [[shinigami]] who are beaten, she uses her ability and skilfully slacks off.

==Character Design==
[[File:PMiSS star.jpg|thumb|150px|Star, as illustrated in ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]''.]]
===Name===
Her full name is {{nihongo|''Star Sapphire''|スターサファイア}}. Star's name is based on the element which she draws power from: the stars. Her name may also relate to the [http://gs.flir.com/surveillance-products/star-safire/star-safire-III/ "Star SAFIRE® series"], an imaging gyro-stabiliser used for detection. Probably a coincidence, there's a villain known as [[Wikipedia:Star Sapphire (comics)|Star Sapphire]] in [[Wikipedia:DC Comics|DC Comics]].

===Design===
Star's appearance goes through some changes throughout the series. At first, in ''[[Eastern and Little Nature Deity]]'', she's described having long black hair, a blue ribbon attached to it, and gray eyes, as well as butterfly-shaped wings. She wears a white and blue dress, the top part being mostly white, having a blue shoulder cloth, and the bottom part being blue. She has long sleeves and a blue piece of cloth attached around her waist, attaching as a ribbon in her back. She also wears boots.

From ''[[Strange and Bright Nature Deity]]'' onwards, Star's hair is brown, and her eyes are now yellow. She wears a frilly blue dress, having a white shoulder cloth and white long sleeves. She also has a small blue string attached as a ribbon at neck-level. In ''[[Fairy Wars]]'', her dress is depicted as having stars on it, but these don't appear in her later appearances in ''Strange and Bright Nature Deity'' or ''[[Oriental Sacred Place]]''.

In ''Strange and Bright Nature Deity'', during New Year's eve, Sunny Milk decides that she wants to bond all the fairies together to cause an incident. Sunny then crushes Cirno's home, along with her partners including Luna who follows Sunny's plan and leaving a flag showcasing images of their faces to show their superiority. Afterwards, Cirno sets on sending them a declaration of war, but the fairy trio believes that it's from the [[human]]s and train for the months to come everyday, believing they would soon fight [[Reimu Hakurei]].

The next spring, they are confronted by [[Cirno]], who was reminded by the fairies flag that they had destroyed her house months prior, resulting in the [[Fairy Wars|Fairy War]].

{{nihongo|'''Suika Ibuki'''|伊吹 萃香|Ibuki Suika}} is the main antagonist of [[Immaterial and Missing Power]]. She's a typical [[oni]] that loves drinking and fighting. Just as the folktales say, she has two horns on her head that symbolize her oni heritage, and enough physical strength to throw large boulders single-handedly.

==General Information==
Suika chiefly appears in the spin-off game installments of the ''[[Touhou Project]]'', such as ''[[Immaterial and Missing Power]]'' and ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]''. Her only appearance in a main game is appearing as a support character for [[Reimu Hakurei]] in ''[[Subterranean Animism]]''.

It is unknown exactly where she is living currently. In many endings of ''[[Immaterial and Missing Power]]'', she is shown spending her time at the [[Hakurei Shrine]], but in ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'', it says she is mainly active around the [[Youkai Mountain]], and when visiting it during the events of ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]'', she comments on how nostalgic it feels. In ''[[Strange and Bright Nature Deity]]'' she is shown to be coming and going between [[Gensokyo]] and the country of oni in the [[Underworld]]. At the end of her route in ''Scarlet Weather Rhapsody'', she was seen spending some time in [[Heaven]] after having defeated [[Tenshi Hinanawi]] in battle, but she was shown to be in Gensokyo after that.

===Personality===
Her personality is jolly and quite childish, as you would expect from her appearance. Despite her childlike exterior, however, she possesses great amounts of raw power. She loves drinking and is frequently seen in the fighting games drunk; she claims she's been drinking sake for some hundreds of years now.&lt;ref name="baijr"&gt;[[Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red]] - Suika article and interview.&lt;/ref&gt;

Suika bears the typical personality traits of most [[oni]], valuing strength and fair play while despising dishonesty and cowardice. However, she is apparently slightly less honest than a typical oni. In addition, she doesn't kidnap [[human]]s, which is known to be the "strongest bond of trust" between oni and humans. However, she is nonetheless quite honest.&lt;ref name="suikaending"&gt;''[[Immaterial and Missing Power]]'' - Suika ending.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though she is generally a happy-go-lucky oni, as one of the most powerful [[youkai]] in [[Gensokyo]], she can be very observant. In addition, she is seen being very critical of others in ''[[Immaterial and Missing Power]]'', such as by calling [[Alice Margatroid]] a coward and telling [[Youmu Konpaku]] how people make fun of her.

===Abilities===
; Strength 
Suika, more than the abnormal strength of an [[oni]], possesses super-strength. [[Aya Shameimaru]], who has probably seen or heard of nearly every [[youkai]] by now, once referred to Suika as "simply the most powerful [[youkai]] in [[Gensokyo]]"&lt;ref&gt; Suika's Spell Card [[Shoot the Bullet/Spell Cards/Level Ex|"Night Parade of a Million Demons"]] &lt;/ref&gt;. That doesn't mean there aren't others that could be nearly equal to her power, but she is still thought of as the strongest/most powerful [[youkai]] in Aya's opinion. Of course, this may be because she is a [[tengu]], who were once subordinate to the oni. At the time of ''[[Silent Sinner in Blue]]'', among the people that [[Reimu Hakurei]] knows, it seems that she had the greatest super-strength &lt;ref&gt; Chapter 16 ''[[Silent Sinner in Blue]]'' &lt;/ref&gt;, but she admits that [[Yuugi Hoshiguma]] might be (physically) stronger than she is.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]] - ''According to fellow oni Suika Ibuki, "She's weaker than me in magical powers, but might be stronger than me physically."''&lt;/ref&gt; She once uttered "my army is the night parade of a hundred demons! No [[human]] or [[youkai]] can stand against foregathered oni!"&lt;ref&gt;[[Immaterial_and_Missing_Power/Story/Reimu%27s_Scenario#Immaterial_and_Missing_Power]]&lt;/ref&gt;

;Manipulation of density and sparseness
[[File:GoMIllus-Suika.jpg|thumb|left|192px|A giant Suika about to squash [[Marisa Kirisame]], as illustrated in ''[[The Grimoire of Marisa]]''.]]
Suika's ability to manipulate "density" gives her the power to control the density of any given object; to put it simply, assembly and dispersion. As the object's density increases, it heats up, and as it decreases, it turns into a mist.&lt;ref name="pmiss"&gt;[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]] - Suika article.&lt;/ref&gt; During her spell cards and other attacks, she can also create smaller versions of herself and make herself giant. She can also decrease her own body's density to become a mist, as she did during the events of ''[[Immaterial and Missing Power]]'', making it impossible to attack her.&lt;ref name="grimoire"&gt;[[The Grimoire of Marisa]] - Suika's spell cards.&lt;/ref&gt; By doing this all over [[Gensokyo]], she can effectively keep an eye on everything going on. She can also gather things without shape, like people's souls, which caused the incident in the first place. She has also affected the [[Moon]] as reflected in sky (the canopy) to make it explode, then take the falling fragments and turn them into mist as well,&lt;ref name="baijr"/&gt; but the details as to how are unknown. [[Youmu Konpaku]], after striking her with one of her swords, commented that the sword itself reacted strangely.&lt;ref name="suikaroute"&gt;''[[Immaterial and Missing Power]]'' - Suika route, stage 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

With this power, she was able to assemble the thoughts of people and youkai, and made the residents of Gensokyo periodically have a party. Furthermore, with this power she is able to split up into small pieces and become a giant, and she is also able to disperse into the atmosphere. Other than that, she is able to compress her attack and increase her power, and is able to draw the opponent into something like a black hole, and sucking the opponent's power, out of nowhere she assembles rocks and health, and the way she throws it can be seen. It seems like she is able to turn a mountain into sand by this power (according to ''[[Immaterial and Missing Power]]''). During her mystery attacks on [[Myouren Temple]] in ''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'' chapter 9, she was capable of one-hit knockouts without being seen. She was also able to collect all the trash around the Hakurei Shrine in three seconds.&lt;ref&gt;[[Immaterial and Missing Power]] - Ending n°7 (Alice's good ending)&lt;/ref&gt;

Unbelievably, in her last spell in ''Immaterial and Missing Power'''s story mode, "Pandemonium" or "A Million Oni Parade the Night," her spell gauge and her health gauge disperse, making an unthinkable system-intervention model for its usage method.

===Possessions===
Suika has a gourd that she calls the Ibuki Gourd, which has been soaked in the extract of a [[sake bug]], making it capable of turning water into sake.&lt;ref name="fairies"&gt;[[Strange and Bright Nature Deity]] - Chapter 18.&lt;/ref&gt; To prevent it from overflowing, the gourd has a stopper on it, and she can't pour out more than the gourd will hold at one time. Closing the gourd will make it refill right away.&lt;ref name="yukariending"&gt;''[[Immaterial and Missing Power]]'' - Yukari ending.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Backstory==
Before appearing in [[Gensokyo]], Suika lived in the [[Underworld]]. However, before even that, she apparently lived on the [[Youkai Mountain]] as one of the four "Devas of the Mountain", along with [[Yuugi Hoshiguma]], [[Kasen Ibaraki]], and one other. Since the oni were superior to the other residents of the mountain, such as the [[tengu]] and [[kappa]], they all still remember her even now as someone to be respected.&lt;ref name="sa"&gt;''[[Subterranean Animism]]'' - Marisa/Nitori route, stage 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character Design==
[[File:PMiSS suika.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Suika in ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'']]
===Origin===
Suika is most likely based off of [[wikipedia:ja:酒呑童子|Shuten-douji]]. Shuten-douji was a man who lived a [[half-youkai]] existence, with an existence between that of a human and [[wikipedia:Yamata no Orochi|Yamata no Orochi]], known as one of the {{nihongo|Three Great Evil Youkai of Japan|日本三大悪妖怪}} alongside [[wikipedia:Tamamo-no-Mae|Tamamo-no-Mae]] and the [[tengu]] form of [[wikipedia:Emperor Sutoku|Emperor Sutoku]]. In the prefectural border between Gifu Prefecture and Shiga Prefecture was [[wikipedia:Mount Ibuki|Mount Ibuki]], which was his birthplace. Furthermore, in the [[wikipedia:Otogizōshi|Otogizooshi]] Shuten-douji is said to have been abandoned after birth at the foot of Mt. Ibuki, and to have been previously been known as {{nihongo|||伊吹童子|Ibuki-douji}}.

[[wikipedia:ja:大江山|Mt. Ooe]] was a mountain that extended over [[wikipedia:Fukuchiyama, Kyoto|Fukuchiyama]], [[wikipedia:Miyazu, Kyoto|Miyazu]], and [[wikipedia:Yosano, Kyoto|Yosano, Kyoto]]. It was once a mine heavily mined for copper, nickel, and chromium. There is a legend where the aforementioned Shuten-douji and his subordinates were exterminated, and in fact, '''completely massacred''', and in the town centre of [[wikipedia:Ōe, Yamagata|Oe]], near the [[wikipedia:Oe Station|Oe Station]] ([[wikipedia:Kitakinki Tango Railway|Kitakinki Tango Railway]]), there are many associated images, [[wikipedia:Onigawara|Onigawara]], mozaic images, and other things like that lined up. One of her ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]'' spell cards, "''Complete Massacre on Mt. Ooe''" probably comes from this.

Among Shuten-douji's subordinates, among the especially powerful "big four," there was one oni by the name of "Hoshikuma-douji." This is where the name of Suika's ally from the [[Big Four of the Mountain|big four]], [[Yuugi Hoshiguma]], comes from. Furthemore, according to the legend, [[wikipedia:Ibaraki-dōji|Ibaraki-douji]] (on whom [[Kasen Ibaraki]] is based) was a subordinate or even lover of Shuten-douji. Within the Touhou setting, Kasen and Suika's relationship is as of yet unknown.

===Name===
Her full name is {{nihongo|''Suika Ibuki''|伊吹 萃香}}. Her first name {{nihongo||萃香|Suika}} is not a legitimate Japanese word, but literally it can be translated as "gathering fragrance". Incidentally, {{nihongo||スイカ/西瓜/水瓜|suika}} is the word for watermelon in the Japanese language (in common Japanese, the [[wikipedia:Japanese pitch accent|pitch accent]] for "watermelon" is flat. In order to distinguish, native speakers pronounce her name as "Su*[high] i*[high] ka*[low]"). Her last name {{nihongo||伊吹|Ibuki}} can mean [[Wikipedia:Chinese_juniper|Chinese Juniper]] in Japanese, but in her case, it's highly likely to be a reference to {{nihongo|[[wikipedia:Mount Ibuki|Mount Ibuki]]|伊吹山|Ibuki-yama}} the place where [[wikipedia:Shuten-dōji|Shuten-douji]] supposedly was born. In addition, {{nihongo||酒呑|Shuten}} means "alcohol drink".

===Design===
Suika has two long straight oni horns on her head, decorated with ribbons. She wears a tattered pale pink blouse, a long purple and pink skirt, and three chain accessories tied to her belt. Her eyes are brown.

The three symbols are related to [[Wikipedia:Sengai|Gibon Sengai]]'s Picture "[https://www.wikiart.org/en/sengai/the-universe-the-circle-triangle-and-square Circle, Triangle, Square]" (or Three Dimensions of Somatic Attunement). This picture is so esoteric that there are several interpretations on it, but the significance of the three diagrams would be mentioned by [[Rinnosuke Morichika]] in [[Curiosities of Lotus Asia/Chapter 22|Chapter 22]] of [[Curiosities of Lotus Asia]].

Though fighting games sprites represent her with blonde/light brown hair, it must be considered as an error; Suika's real hair color actually being ginger (orange) according to [[Alphes]]' artworks and [[ZUN]]'s artworks and sprites.

==Appearances==
===Spin-offs===
;''Immaterial and Missing Power''
:{{Main|Immaterial and Missing Power/Story#Suika.27s_Story|l1=Immaterial and Missing Power Story}}
During the events of ''[[Immaterial and Missing Power]]'', the people of [[Gensokyo]] were manipulated into having feasts repeatedly, one right after another, by Suika's ability to "gather" anything. She intended to draw all the other [[oni]] out of hiding with continuous, non-stop celebration. Her motive for this was the short spring in ''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]'' and the lower number of flower viewings that could be held because of it.

In most characters' scenarios, Suika was defeated and the number of feasts began to decrease. In Suika's scenario, she managed to defeat all of her major foes in a feast, but her plan failed anyway due to [[Reimu Hakurei]]'s ability and her own short-comings as an [[oni]].

;''Shoot the Bullet''
[[File:Th095Suika.png|frame|Suika in ''StB'', ''DS'' &amp; ''ISC'']]
In ''[[Shoot the Bullet]]'', [[Aya Shameimaru]] encountered Suika on the Extra [[stage]] and took photos of her [[danmaku]], being the first [[shoot 'em up]] game Suika appears in.

;''Scarlet Weather Rhapsody''
:{{Main|Scarlet Weather Rhapsody/Translation/Suika's Scenario|l1=Scarlet Weather Rhapsody Story}}
In ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]'', she notices that temperaments are being gathered from everyone into the sky, so she decides to climb up the [[Youkai Mountain]] to follow them. Once she reaches the heavens, she locates [[Tenshi Hinanawi|the perpetrator]]. Instead of trying to put an end to whatever plot was going on, Suika demands a living space in the heavens. She later gathers everyone to the heavens to attack [[Tenshi Hinanawi]], although whether it was to punish the celestial or just to pass the time is unclear.

;''Subterranean Animism''
:{{Main|Subterranean Animism/Translation/Reimu and Suika's Scenario|l1=Subterranean Animism Story}}

;''Touhou Hisoutensoku''
:{{Main|Touhou Hisoutensoku/Translation/Suika's Script|l1=Touhou Hisoutensoku Story}}
If connecting ''SWR'' with ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]'', then Suika can become a selectable character to play with, although she appears in no scenarios.

;''Double Spoiler''
[[File:Th135Yuugi&amp;Suika.png|frame|Suika with Yuugi in ''Hopeless Masquerade'']]
In ''[[Double Spoiler]]'', Suika appeared as a [[stage]] 6 target, where she uses a few [[spell card]]s and had [[Aya Shameimaru]] and [[Hatate Himekaidou]] take photos of her and her [[danmaku]].

;''Hopeless Masquerade''
Suika made a background cameo appearance in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'' on the [[Human Village]] stage. She is seen standing on a balcony of the tavern with [[Yuugi Hoshiguma]], drinking beer.

;''Impossible Spell Card''
:{{Main|Impossible Spell Card#Story|l1=Impossible Spell Card: Story}}
After apparently reading the newspaper by the [[tengu]] about a mischief-making [[amanojaku]], Suika becomes one of the many strong [[youkai]] and [[human]]s to try and stop [[Seija Kijin]]. She uses [[spell card]]s that are considered impossible to dodge.

;''Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red''
:''Main article: [[Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red/Suika]]''
[[Aya Shameimaru]] realizes that the [[Moon]] has exploded late one midwinter night and goes to interview the person responsible, Suika Ibuki. Suika is drunk, but she manages to tell Aya that she did it as a threat to all those who were partying, reminding them of onis by shattering the sky, a proof of their awesome strength by splitting the sky apart so easily to blow up the Moon.

During the follow interview, Suika challenges Aya to a drinking match even as she asks her for sake. Aya seems to accept and invites Suika to drink with her at a nearby food cart, with hilarious results as Suika talks about silencing the [[Mystia_Lorelei|poor owner]]. Aya then mentions her surprise at Suika and the onis being back. Suika responds that she is the only one, and she's come back only for a while. She also tells Aya how sad she is that the tengu have lost most of their influence. Suika finishes by accusing the tengu of not showing their strength and Aya ends the discussion by inviting Suika to drink about gathering news for her.
[[File:WaHHSuikaAppearance.jpg|thumb|right||120px|Suika appearance in [[Wild and Horned Hermit]] chapter 9]]
;''Strange and Bright Nature Deity''
In Chapter 17 and 18, Suika gives a jug with a [[sake bug]] in it to [[Reimu Hakurei]]. However, it's soon stolen by the [[Three Fairies of Light]], who replace it with a fake. The real jug is later taken to [[Eientei]] for analysis, and when Suika returns to the shrine, they find that the jug no longer contains the bug. She is not particularly concerned at it, however, and proceeds to explain to Reimu and [[Marisa Kirisame]] what it does.

;''Wild and Horned Hermit''
In the end of Chapter 9, Suika is revealed to be the culprit behind the strange attacks that have been happening lately, especially in and around the [[Myouren Temple]]. She eventually went to the shrine hoping to see [[Kasen Ibaraki]], but she disappears before they meet. She reappears at the end of Chapter 16 for the same purpose, having received a tip from [[Yuugi Hoshiguma]], and thinks to herself that Kasen doesn't need to keep hiding, and that she hasn't seen her in a long time. In chapter 20, Suika disguises as the merchant of a stand where Kasen goes, where she explains that knows what Kasen's real plans are and that she is trying to cross the barrier, but Suika is interrupted by Reimu before she could end her explanations of how to do it.

==Relationships==
===Yuugi Hoshiguma===
Suika and [[Yuugi Hoshiguma]] were two of the four devas of the [[Youkai Mountain|mountain]], and are very good friends, although it's been a while since they've actually seen each other before ''[[Subterranean Animism]]''.  Of course, their reunion during that time was not in person, but instead Suika talking with Yuugi using Yukari's yin-yang orbs. Suika hopes the four of them can go mountain climbing again, some day. They've been seen hanging around together in the background of the [[Human Village]] of ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]''.

===Yukari Yakumo===
[[Yukari Yakumo]] was Suika's friend before the oni went to the [[Underworld]]. It is unknown how or when they became friends. Yukari cares about Suika, as her (hypothetical) ''[[Immaterial and Missing Power]]'' story has her stop Suika because she's worried that people will find Suika whom won't be as forgiving as Yukari is. Suika does favors for Yukari, such as rebuilding the [[Hakurei Shrine]] in ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]'' or going along with her scheme in ''[[Subterranean Animism]]''. The two play danmaku battles with each other, though it's been a while since the last one before ''Scarlet Weather Rhapsody''. In ''[[Oriental Sacred Place]]'' Chapter 12, Yukari is with Suika at the Hakurei Shrine New Year's Festival.

Suika (an oni) does tend to get annoyed with Yukari's "dirty tricks", but doesn't go beyond snapping that they're dirty. Suika referred to Yukari's existence as fraudulent to [[Youmu Konpaku]] in ''Immaterial and Missing Power'', and stated to Yukari that it was rare to see her "on this side of the world" in broad daylight in ''Scarlet Weather Rhapsody''. These may be simple figures of speech, or they may show that Suika knows many deeper things about Yukari.

===Reimu Hakurei===
[[Reimu Hakurei]]'s honesty in ''[[Immaterial and Missing Power]]'' impressed the oni when they first met. The oni now drops by the shrine often. Reimu usually has Suika pick up garbage. Once Suika even gave Reimu a [[sake bug]] as a gift so they could drink quality sake together (unfortunately, a series of events resulted in the worm being lost). She has teamed up with Reimu to go along with Yukari's scheme in ''[[Subterranean Animism]]''.

===Miyoi Okunoda===
In ''[[Lotus Eaters]]'', [[Miyoi Okunoda]] possessed the Ibuki Gourd (without permission) to be able to see the world outside of [[Geidontei]]. Though Suika is aware of this happening, she did not interfere at first to see what Miyoi would do. When Suika finally questioned Miyoi, they got along and came to an agreement: Suika will let Miyoi stay in the Ibuki Gourd whenever she wants to and, in return, Miyoi will keep Geidontei open late whenever Suika stops by.

===[[Kasen Ibaraki]]===
Their relationship is obscure, but because Kasen was trying to avoid Suika as much as possible in the ''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'', their connection should not be light. Later, Suika finds out about her from Yuugi but decides to leave it alone as she's curious on what Kasen's scheming. The two speak on familiar terms when they do come face to face, and Suika knows what Kasen's true intentions for hanging around the Hakurei Shrine are.

It is eventually revealed that Kasen is the third of the four devas, explaining the two's familiarity with one another. How their relationship changed after the breakup of the devas is unknown.

===Minor relationships===
;[[Tenshi Hinanawi]]
Suika travelled up to [[Heaven]] and beat up Tenshi to get some land. Iku mentions in her ending that Tenshi must have gave it to her without consulting any of the other celestials about the matter. Since then, Suika played at least one prank on Tenshi by gathering up many others to come fight her. Tenshi initially figured that it'd be okay because Suika will get bored and leave heaven soon, but by the time the final story (Tenshi's) in ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]'' ends. Suika's still up there, causing Tenshi to worry about just how long the oni plans on staying.

;[[Iku Nagae]]
Iku first encounters Suika when Suika is climbing to [[Heaven]] to see [[Tenshi Hinanawi|someone]], where she tested Suika before allowing Suika to move on. Suika won, surprising Iku with her power. Iku later runs into Suika while searching for [[Tenshi Hinanawi]] to file a report on earthquakes. The oni requests Iku play with her for a bit and fights Iku in a duel. Iku is extremely confused why the oni is still in Heaven, but had to get back to her job. Eventually, after a long string of being attacked by various residents of [[Gensokyo]] for no reason whatsoever and an infuriating meeting with Tenshi, the poor exhausted [[oarfish]] arrives back in heaven and runs into the oni again. Suika's story of Tenshi giving her land gets the oarfish even more exasperated at the celestial, and Suika cheerfully comforts her and pours her a drink, encouraging Iku to vent her complaints to the oni. It is unknown if they became friends after that or not.

;[[Patchouli Knowledge]]
After the events of ''[[Immaterial and Missing Power]]'', Patchouli seems to have developed a bit of an obsession with taking down the oni, although the feeling isn't mutual. She now has [[Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red/Patchouli|the Scarlet Devil Mansion host Setsubun]] (basically an anti-oni festival) every year, despite how none of the other residents like it (the fried beans burn [[Remilia Scarlet|the mistress]], and the fairy maids hate cleaning up afterwards). Suika has taken note of this and in retaliation to the first festival, [[Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red/Suika|destroyed the moon as a display of her own power]] (actually only an image of the moon, by shattering the heavens to do it). It is unknown if residents of the [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]] noticed.

In ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]'', Patchouli goes right past [[Tenshi Hinanawi]] (the real culprit, quite confused) to attack Suika, instead. Patchouli has no books on the oni, but dialogue shows she knew what oni were before meeting Suika. Her wariness towards oni subconsciously existed before that, as it is revealed in Sakuya's ending that despite claiming she didn't know about oni, Patchouli knew an oni caused the feast, revealing a subconscious knowledge on the matter. Prior to that, every once in a while, Patchouli would order coffee made from good beans instead of the usual red tea. Sakuya did not know why, but after discovering this subconscious trait, she finally understood. Oni are weak to fried beans. Patchouli only consciously realized she was supposed to use fried beans, specifically, for the coffee in her own ending, but by then, she's also realized it'd be better off used as danmaku. It is unclear if she realized that she subconsciously drank coffee all along as a preventative measure to oni. It is unknown why Patchouli developed this wariness towards the oni.

;[[Yuyuko Saigyouji]]
Yuyuko might have known Suika before Suika went to the [[Underworld]], as she describes the mist in ''[[Immaterial and Missing Power]]'' to [[Patchouli Knowledge]] as nostalgic in Patchouli's story, even though she isn't sure what it is. When Yuyuko meets Suika in her own story, she disappointingly says that she had hoped to find a good memory but ended up finding a little [[demon]] instead, and the two proceed to insult each other very harshly. Although the double-speak and metaphors aren't completely clear, this could imply that Yuyuko knew Suika from long ago, and the two did not get along.

;[[Yamame Kurodani]], [[Parsee Mizuhashi]], [[Satori Komeiji]], [[Rin Kaenbyou]], [[Utsuho Reiuji]], and [[Koishi Komeiji]]
These are various denizens of the [[Underworld]] that Suika got to see in ''[[Subterranean Animism]]''. Of the six, Suika has never met Yamame, Rin, or Utsuho personally (or at least gotten to know them personally), but is familiar with their species. She knows Parsee, but to her, Parsee is just some lowly [[youkai]] that guards a bridge. She knows Satori, but like everyone else, stays away from her because she dislikes having her mind read. She also knows Satori's sister Koishi, to whom she is a bit warmer, inviting her to come play the next time Koishi goes above ground. She believes Koishi's ability to read the subconscious compensates for Satori's weakness in a fight, indicating she may have gotten into battles or duels with the sisters before (probably playful, but maybe not).

　　能力：密と疎を操る程度の能力&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
　　　幻想郷にはいないとされる鬼。彼女はその鬼だと言う。&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
　　　鬼は一般的に陽気で酒好き、勿論宴も大好き、人間との真剣勝負が大好きで、勝負事なら格闘だろうが呑み比べだろうが何でもする。気に入った人間を見つけると人間が用意したルールで戦おうとする。そして、勝負に勝つとその人間を攫って行くのである。&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
　　　鬼は楽しいと思ってやっていた事だが、人間はそれを楽しむすべを知らなかった。どれも人間が敵うレベルでは無かったからである。本当は人間も鬼に勝つぐらい強くなれば、互いに楽しむことも出来たのだが、それもしなくなった。そればかりか人間は、卑怯な策で鬼を一網打尽しようとした。&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
　　　鬼が人を攫うのは、人間の恐怖心の象徴であり、それが鬼の存在理由でもある。人間にとってもその恐怖心は必要だったのだが……それを、人間は全て自分達の都合で一方的に壊してしまったのだ。&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
　　　鬼は、繰り返される卑怯な鬼の乱獲により、そんな人間達を永遠に見捨て人間の手の届かない場所に移り住んだ、と伝えられていた。もう、鬼の姿を見ることは無かった。&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
　　　能力は、密と疎を操る事が出来る。如何なる物も、集めたり散らしたり出来る。人の想いを集めれば、宴会のようなものを開かせることも出来るし、自分を散らせば霧のような状態になることも出来る。妖霧は非常に薄い彼女なのだ。新しく力を生むのではなく、その場に在るものを集めたり散らしたりするだけだが、集めることで別の物に変化させることも出来る。それは特殊な創造の能力に近い。さすがは失われた鬼の力、と言われるだけの事はある。&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
　　　身体能力も非常に優れており、力、スピード、妖力、全てにおいて人間を遙かに上回る。唯一の弱点は、萃香のリーチのなさだが、彼女は様々な手段でそれを補う。人間との決闘が大好きなだけあって、酒に酔っていてもめっぽう強い。と言うか酔うほど強い。と言うか酔ってない時が余りない。

'''Suika Ibuki'''

Species: [[Oni]]&lt;br/&gt;
Location: Some hidden country occupied by oni (currently she's living somewhere in [[Gensokyo]])&lt;br/&gt;
Ability: Manipulating density and sparseness

There are supposedly no [[oni]] in [[Gensokyo]], but this girl insists that she is an oni.

Oni are generally jolly and love to drink, feast, and compete with [[human]]s in any kind of contest, from simple melee to drinking games. When they find a human that they like, they tempt that human into challenging them in any way the human desires. Should the human lose, they are abducted.

The oni find these games to be great fun, but humans don't appreciate the nature of that fun. Put simply, humans cannot compare to an oni's level of ability. Humans ''could'' enjoy themselves as much as the oni if they tried to reach the power level of their opponents, but they don't. Worse still, humans attempt to destroy the oni with underhanded tactics.

Abduction by oni used to be a symbol of human fear, which was the oni's reason for their existence. In a way, that fear was necessary to the human race... Yet, the humans selfishly put an end to it.

The oni, growing weary of being duped and killed repeatedly, abandoned humans for all time and moved to a place beyond human reach, or so the legend says. In any case, the oni have not been seen since.

This girl insists that she is an oni.

She is certainly jolly and loves drinking, and likes feasts so much that she has them every 3 days. The reason for that is given in-game, so I won't mention it here. But to tell the truth, she wants to restore the relationship between humans and oni. Now why did that fail...? That's also mentioned in-game, toward the end.

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&amp;#183;&amp;#183;&lt;/div&gt;

As mentioned above, Suika is jolly and drink loving. Innocent and simple-minded.
She raises an upbeat atmosphere in a crowd, but when you're alone with her, you'll gradually become irritated by her childishness.

Her ability allows her to control density and sparseness. She can gather and scatter whatever she desires. By gathering people's sentiments, they will have parties; by scattering herself, she can become as mist. The strange mist was herself, in very thin form. Her ability does not produce new power and can only gather and scatter that which already exists, but it can also transform one thing into something completely different. It's kind of close to creation in that way. The long lost power of the oni is truly exceptional.

Her physical ability is outstanding as well; her strength, speed, and magical power all far exceed that of a human's. Her sole weakness is her small stature, but she compensates for that in many ways. Since she loves competition against humans, she is quite tough even when she is drunk. That is to say, the more drunk she is, the tougher she becomes. Or rather, there's hardly a time when she isn't drunk.

Suika Ibuki

Her pose is different from all the other characters' ...&lt;br/&gt;
I tried to make her grandiose, like a boss should be. I really brought out her liveliness.&lt;br/&gt;
She may not look very oni-like, but for me, chains are the mark of an oni (g)&lt;br/&gt;
The circle is for nothingness, which signifies diffusion; the triangle is for harmony, or collection.&lt;br/&gt;
The square is for permanence, and stands for the self.

One of the oni who lived underground.&lt;br/&gt;
She spends her days above ground now, but it's not known where she lives.

She heard rumors that something was going on underground, so she tried going along with Yukari's scheme. She did think about going to see what was happening herself, but this way looked fun and was convenient, so she was pretty impressed with Yukari's technique, which let her tag along while having a drink.

{{nihongo|'''Sumireko Usami'''|宇佐見 菫子|Usami Sumireko}} is the main antagonist of ''[[Urban Legend in Limbo]]'' and is the main protagonist of ''[[Violet Detector]]''. She's a [[human]] from the [[Outside World]] with psychic powers (ESP). She is the first president of the [[Secret Sealing Club]].

==General Information==
Sumireko first appeared as the Final Boss of ''[[Urban Legend in Limbo]]'', and eventually becomes a playable character of the same game.

===Personality===
Sumireko has shown herself to be extremely intelligent, determined, passionate, and [[Wikipedia:hubris|hubristic]] in equal parts. At her best, she is friendly and passionate about life and learning about the world around her. At her worst, she can devolve into stubbornness and outright obstinance, going so far as to put herself in grave danger to achieve her goals. &lt;ref name="PULiL"&gt; ''[[Urban Legend in Limbo]]'' - Sumireko's Profile &lt;/ref&gt;

Despite her apparent superiority complex, she has grown to have a deep respect and admiration for the inhabitants of Gensokyo, referring to many of them as her friends, and looking up to them for mentorship and guidance. She describes herself as having been a bit of a loner prior to her arrival in Gensokyo, and she considers her discovery of Gensokyo to be the best thing to have happened in her life due to the friendships she's made there. &lt;ref&gt; ''[[Alternative Facts in Eastern Utopia]]'' - [[Alternative Facts in Eastern Utopia/Article and Interview/Sumireko Usami|Sumireko Usami Interview]] ''"I'm so glad I started coming to Gensokyo, though. I feel link I've finally escaped from that gloomy, closed-off place!"'' &lt;/ref&gt; 

She also describes herself as being [[Wikipedia:Chūnibyō|chuunibyou]],&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Grimoire of Usami]]'' - [[The Grimoire of Usami/Section 1-9|Section 1-9]]&lt;/ref&gt; a term usually used mockingly, with a sense of personal pride, alluding to her psychic powers and other magical abilities. In spite of that pride, she does lament that nobody in the Outside World seems to be able to understand her or her passion about the occult and Gensokyo. This may also be in part due to how highly opinionated she is, espousing her beliefs about the "phoniness" of the [[Outside World]]'s dominant consumerist culture at the slightest provocation.&lt;ref name="IAFiEU"&gt;''[[Alternative Facts in Eastern Utopia]]'' - [[Alternative Facts in Eastern Utopia/Article and Interview/Sumireko Usami|Sumireko Usami Interview]]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Sumireko seems to hold several contradictory opinions, although it comes off less as hypocrisy, and more as though she hasn't been able to fully make up her mind about certain subjects due to her inexperience of being a teenager.

===Abilities===
;Esper
She is a strong [[Wikipedia:Psychic|psychic]], capable of various powers associated with the [[Wikipedia:Occult|occult]], including but seemingly not limited to levitation, &lt;ref&gt; ''[[Urban Legend in Limbo]]'' - [[Urban Legend in Limbo/Story/Mamizou's Scenario|Mamizou's Scenario]]  "''My, a human flying in the sky is pretty rare these days''" &lt;/ref&gt; pyrokinesis, hydrokinesis, telekinesis, psychokinesis, and teleportation. &lt;ref&gt; ''[[Urban Legend in Limbo]]'' - ''[[Urban Legend in Limbo/Spell Cards/Sumireko Usami|Sumireko's Spell Cards]] &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; ''[[Violet Detector]]'' ESP Levels &lt;/ref&gt; 
 
;Doppelgänger
After the events of ''[[Urban Legend in Limbo]]'', she unwittingly develops a [[Wikipedia:Doppelgänger|doppelgänger]] which maintains her "permanent" presence in Gensokyo.&lt;ref&gt;[[Curiosities of Lotus Asia]] - [[Curiosities of Lotus Asia/Chapter 33|Chapter 33]]&lt;/ref&gt; She is able to recall the memories of both the doppelgänger as well as those from her "normal" life in the [[Outside World]], allowing her to live a double-life in both worlds.

==Character Design==
===Name===
Her full name is {{nihongo|''Sumireko Usami''|宇佐見 菫子|Usami Sumireko}}. {{nihongo|''Usami''|宇佐見}} uses the same writing as [[Renko Usami]]'s surname and it is known to be an actual name in Japanese. {{nihongo|''Sumireko''|菫子}} literally means "violet child" and is also similar to how Renko's name means "lotus child", as both take their names from flowers.

===Design===
Sumireko has brown eyes and shoulder-length brown hair tied in pigtails. On her head is a black hat with a white bow along with red-framed glasses. She wears a purple plaid skirt and matching sleeveless top (resembling a jumper dress), over a long-sleeved white blouse and a black bolo tie with a clasp shaped like a [[wikipedia:Quimbaya artifacts|"Quimbaya airplane"]]. Along with this, she wears white socks with bows and black shoes. Sumireko generally carries [[wikipedia:Zener cards|Zener cards]], a tablet computer marked with a hexagram on the back, a smartphone in a white case with various blue shapes on it and a light-blue [[wikipedia:Liberator_(gun)|liberator]]. She also wears white gloves, and a black, high-collared cloak with a red interior inscribed with pinkish-white runes and a series of white lines at the bottom rim of the backside.

Her summer uniform appears nearly identical to her winter one, but with shorter and looser sleeves, no gloves, and a skull in place of the Quimbaya airplane.

===Spin-offs===
;''Urban Legend in Limbo''
Sumireko is the main antagonist of ''Urban Legend in Limbo'' and the final boss in most of the characters' scenarios in story mode.

Sumireko manages to go through the [[Great Hakurei Barrier]] by using the [[Occult Ball]]s, which are special stones gathered from [[Mystery Spot]]s in the [[Outside World]]. However, after a short period, she is suddenly ejected from Gensokyo. Learning from this, Sumireko starts with brief excursions into Gensokyo to learn more about it, appearing to anyone who catches sight of her as an ominous black shadow.

Sumireko soon devises a plan to spread rumors of the Occult Ball's powers and scatters them around Gensokyo for its residents to find. Once the balls are gathered, they warp back to the Outside World along with whoever gathered them all, just for enough time for Sumireko to learn about them before they are transported back. She then re-enters Gensokyo and scatters the balls again, thus beginning the incident of ''Urban Legend in Limbo''. Her plan works for a while, and although she is baffled at why everyone who comes out of Gensokyo ends up fighting her, she enjoys it nonetheless. 

Soon enough, [[Mamizou Futatsuiwa]] is made aware of the incident and devises her own plan: she claims to have Gensokyo's own Occult Ball in her possession when challenging Sumireko, claiming it would allow her limitless travel between Gensokyo and the Outside World. Mamizou instead tricks Sumireko into entering Gensokyo the ''proper'' way, which does let her stay there, but as Sumireko does not know how to get back ''out'', she is trapped in Gensokyo.

Sumireko's story mode in ''Urban Legend in Limbo'' follows her as she is trapped in Gensokyo, whose residents attempt to scare her to teach her a lesson. In the end, she is confronted by [[Toyosatomimi no Miko]], who reminds Sumireko that she can use the Occult Balls to escape Gensokyo temporarily. She returns to the Outside World, and believing she will eventually be killed by the youkai of Gensokyo, she decides that when her time in the Outside World runs out, she will sacrifice herself to, purportedly, unleash the full power of the Occult Balls and destroy the Great Hakurei Barrier.

Before being brought back to Gensokyo, she is confronted by Reimu in her own story mode, who realized that one of Sumireko's Occult Balls was swapped for a [[Lunar Capital]] ball, which if activated would link Gensokyo with the Lunar Capital instead. Although Reimu defeats Sumireko and saves the Great Hakurei Barrier, the Lunar Capital ball was activated, setting up the events of ''[[Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom]]''. Upon returning to Gensokyo, Sumireko is detained by Reimu, Mamizou and [[Kasen Ibaraki]]. Deciding Sumireko was no longer a threat, they return her to the Outside World through the proper method.

A few days later, Sumireko reappears at the [[Hakurei Shrine]], as she had discovered that ever since leaving Gensokyo, she could travel back there in her dreams. No longer antagonistic, she befriends Gensokyo's residents in earnest, and her tales of the Outside World turn her into a brief celebrity.

;''Antinomy of Common Flowers''
Sumireko is a playable character with an unlockable story mode in ''[[Antinomy of Common Flowers]]''. In her story mode, she visited Gensokyo at a bad time as the [[Dream World]] has been thrown into chaos by the [[Joon Yorigami|Yorigami]] [[Shion Yorigami|Sisters]]' incident, and she ends up trapped there as a result.

She teams up with [[Doremy Sweet]] to traverse through the Dream World and reach Gensokyo, whereupon they are tasked by [[Yukari Yakumo]] to dispatch Sumireko's own Dream Soul that has been released into the Outside World by the incident. Curiously Sumireko somehow encounters ''two'' of her own Dream Souls, but defeats them with Doremy's help. She awakes in the Outside World afterward, greeted by Doremy to confirm that she is the real Sumireko.

Sumireko is the main protagonist of ''Violet Detector''. For some time, she has been having the same weird dream, in which she is constantly attacked by the residents of the dream world for no reason.
She finally discovers that the dream dwellers hold a grudge against her for having a flesh body allowing her to go in the real world, and [[Doremy Sweet]] tells her that she can only expect the situation to worsen.
After some time, she encounters and fight against [[Okina Matara]]. Okina is impressed by Sumireko who has been able to fend off the dream dwellers for quite some time. She offers her some help, in order to make the dream dwellers recognize her strength and make them stop attacking her. But in order to achieve that, she has to defeat even more powerful nightmares, so Okina lends Sumireko some powers on top of her psychic abilities, allowing her to cheat death in certain situations.

Sumireko then goes on and fights powerful nightmares, in the form of strong dream dwellers teaming up against her. 
After a week of fighting, she encounters another Sumireko. During that confrontation, she realizes that she was actually the [[Phantom#Dream Soul|Dream Soul]] of the real Sumireko, the other one, who is trying to get her body back. But at this point, Dream Sumireko has become stronger than the real Sumireko and is able to defeat her.

Okina, not willing to take any side in the confrontation between the two Sumirekos, decides to take back the power she lent Dream Sumireko to make things fair. The real Sumireko challenges her dream self once again and eventually defeats her.

The next day, Sumireko wakes up in the real world as if nothing happened, having no recollection of what transpired in her mind. She stopped having those nightmares, but the photos of danmaku battles still lie in the memory of her smartphone.

===Literature===
Sumireko makes appearances in ''[[Grimoire of Usami]]'', ''[[Curiosities of Lotus Asia]]'', and ''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]''.

;''Grimoire of Usami''
Sumireko is the creator and writer of this grimoire, having her surname in the title as a result. In it, imitating [[Marisa Kirisame]], she recollects information about the danmaku of various characters who appeared at the firework festival, cataloging and critiquing their patterns. However, some of them wanted to hijack the festival to turn it into a "real danmaku festival", but at the end it ended without major inconveniences. 

;''Wild and Horned Hermit''
In chapter 29, Sumireko appears in the [[Hakurei Shrine]], where it also appears an strange bubble. After [[Reimu Hakurei]] tried to defend Sumireko, the bubble pops on Reimu's gohei and Reimu collapses and starts sleeping. Sumireko realizes that [[Marisa Kirisame]] did the same. [[Kasen Ibara]] appears and, after Sumireko explains the situation, she thinks they are dream souls with the dreams Sumireko had to had instead of her traveling to Gensokyo. As a result, 
Marisa had a dream where she was in Sumireko's school. However, Marisa's dream ended up in Reimu's.

In chapter 31, she appears in the [[Hakurei Shrine]] in the "World UFO Day," and accidentally summons a UFO, which irritated Reimu.

;''Curiosities of Lotus Asia''
In ''[[Curiosities of Lotus Asia]]'', Sumireko helps [[Rinnosuke Morichika]] identifying stuff from his shop and talks with him, Reimu and Marisa about the Outside World. On the other hand, they catalog Sumireko's trials and tribulations as she integrates herself into Gensokyo life, with the development of her occult doppelganger, and her disappearance during ''[[Violet Detector]]''.

==Relationships==
===[[Reimu Hakurei]] &amp; [[Marisa Kirisame]]===
In ''[[Urban Legend in Limbo]]'' and ''[[Curiosities of Lotus Asia]]'', Reimu and Marisa are frequently seen doting on her, making sure she's safe and trying to keep her from getting into trouble. In an interview with [[Aya Shameimaru]] in ''[[Alternative Facts in Eastern Utopia]]'', Sumireko refers to both Reimu and Marisa as friends she's made since coming to Gensokyo. &lt;ref name="IAFiEU"/&gt;

Reimu admits that although she's worried about Sumireko's appearance in Gensokyo and its implications for more [[Outside World]] humans passing through the barrier, Sumireko has made things "fun" in Gensokyo again. Marisa also tries to give advice on how to talk to the local residents.

In ''[[Violet Detector]]'', Sumireko refers to both of them with friendly informal names like "Reimu-cchi" and "Marisa-cchi," typically used between close friends.

===[[Rinnosuke Morichika]]===
In [[Curiosities of Lotus Asia]], which is primarily told through Rinnosuke's perspective, Rinnosuke and Sumireko often talk about the Outside World and the various items that filter in through the [[Great Hakurei Barrier]]. Rinnosuke shows a great deal of care towards Sumireko, worrying about her safety, while Sumireko seems to regard him as a nag, and goes so far as to criticize him for his habits, such as smoking cigarettes. &lt;ref&gt; ''[[Curiosities of Lotus Asia]]'' - [[Curiosities of Lotus Asia/Chapter 32|Chapter 32]] &lt;/ref&gt; Despite that, they seem to be good friends, with Sumireko recently beginning to work as a "part-timer" at [[Kourindou]].&lt;ref name="CoLA36"/&gt;

===[[Mamizou Futatsuiwa]]===
In ''[[Alternative Facts in Eastern Utopia]]'', Sumireko mentions that Mamizou often visits her in the [[Outside World]]. The exact details of this aren't known, but Sumireko implies that they're friends, and that Sumireko respects her as an elder. &lt;ref name="IAFiEU"/&gt;

===[[Kasen Ibaraki]]===
In ''[[Alternative Facts in Eastern Utopia]]'', Sumireko mentions that her and Kasen are also friends, and says that they hang out a lot in Gensokyo, calling her "Kasen-chan." &lt;ref name="IAFiEU"/&gt; or "Kasseny" &lt;ref&gt; ''[[Curiosities of Lotus Asia]]'' - [[Curiosities of Lotus Asia/Chapter 29|Chapter 29]] &lt;/ref&gt; 

In ''[[Urban Legend in Limbo]]'', Kasen expresses resentment that Sumireko views youkai with such a casual and playful attitude, feeling that Sumireko should show youkai more respect. &lt;ref&gt; ''[[Urban Legend in Limbo]]'' - Kasen's [[Urban Legend in Limbo/Story/Kasen's Scenario|Scenario]] &lt;/reF&gt; Despite that, it's shown in ''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'' that Kasen has grown a bit softer on her in more recent times.

===[[Fujiwara no Mokou]]===
Initially annoyed by Sumireko, Mokou challenged Sumireko to a duel. &lt;ref&gt; ''[[Urban Legend in Limbo]]'' - Mokou's [[Urban Legend in Limbo/Story/Mokou's Scenario|Scenario]] &lt;/ref&gt; The two were able to match each other's strength. Mokou extended an invitation to have a rematch sometime in the future, admiring the young girl's fighting spirit and passion, and thanking her for giving her a tough challenge. After fighting again, Mokou helped Sumireko getting out of the [[Bamboo Forest of the Lost]]. &lt;ref&gt; ''[[Urban Legend in Limbo]]'' - Sumireko's [[Urban Legend in Limbo/Story/Sumireko's Scenario|Scenario]] &lt;/ref&gt; It appears the two have become friendly rivals. &lt;ref&gt; ''[[Urban Legend in Limbo]]'' -  Mokou's Ending &lt;/Ref&gt; 

===[[Doremy Sweet]]===
In ''[[Antimony of Common Flowers]]'', Doremy teams up with Sumireko. During the incident, Sumireko is faced with fighting both her dream-self and her occult doppelganger, who have also teamed up to take down the "real" Sumireko. Doremy expresses confusion over how there can possibly be three Sumirekos at the same time in Gensokyo, but ultimately helps Sumireko resolve her issue at the time.

===Minor relationships===
;[[Renko Usami]]
Due to her name, similar appearance and involvement in the creation of the [[Secret Sealing Club]], she may have some kind of relation to Renko. However, the specifics of this connection is as yet unknown. Her profile suggests she is an ancestor of Renko, from the present time.

;[[Okina Matara]]
In ''[[Violet Detector]]'', Okina ultimately assists Sumireko with resolving her real-self/dream-self/doppelganger mix-up situation, but not before toying with her for a little bit. As (real) Sumireko loses her memories of the incident, it's unknown if she remembers Okina at all. 

;[[Shinmyoumaru Sukuna]]
Sumireko finds Shinmyoumaru adorable, claiming to want to somehow take her home as a pet, much to her annoyance. &lt;ref&gt; ''[[Urban Legend in Limbo]]'' - [[Urban Legend in Limbo/Story/Sumireko's Scenario|Sumireko's]] and [[Urban Legend in Limbo/Story/Shinmyoumaru's Scenario|Shinmyoumaru's]] Scenario &lt;/ref&gt;

==Additional Information==
*Sumireko's silhouette occupies the front of ''[[Urban Legend in Limbo]]'' and ''[[Violet Detector]]'''s jewel case. Along with [[Cirno]], she's the only character to appear as the silhouette for two games' jewel cases in the Windows games.
*Sumireko is the first final [[boss]] to be a [[human]] from outside [[Gensokyo]] since the [[PC-98]] game ''[[Phantasmagoria of Dim.Dream]]'', who was [[Yumemi Okazaki]]. Sumireko also has similarities to Yumemi besides this; both have an interest in magic, they tried to take an inhabitant of Gensokyo and had traps provided to lure them into their area.
*She is the first fighting game final boss whose story mode scenario is not the last to be unlocked.
*The runes on her cloak do not appear to form any meaningful words, and some are even drawn from different runic alphabets (e.g. the old-form "sowilo" rune as written in Elder Futhark and the "stan" rune used by [[Wiktionary:Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] writers hundreds of years later).
*Inside the game data for Urban Legend in Limbo, a folder named "Hanako" can be found that contains three sprites of a silhouetted Sumireko holding her cell phone. It's possible that Hanako was a working name for her, or was intended to be her name.
* The 菫 (Sumire) part of her name is the name of a flower, from which the word for flower in Japanese is 花 (Hana). It could also be a codename. 
*''[[Antinomy of Common Flowers]]'' confirms her to be a citizen of the Kantou Region. &lt;ref&gt; ''[[Urban Legend in Limbo]]'' - Sumireko's Ending &lt;/ref&gt; Incidentally, [[Renko]]'s parents also live in Tokyo. &lt;ref&gt; ''[[Retrospective 53 minutes]]'' - ''"Renko Usami and Maribel Hearn (Merry) decided to take a trip to Tokyo where Renko's parents live during their university's vacation."'' &lt;/ref&gt;
*One of her alternate color palettes in ''[[Urban Legend in Limbo]]'' resembles [[wikipedia:Kaito Kuroba|Kaito Kuroba]] from [[wikipedia:Case Closed|Detective Conan]].

　　その中でも特に、この世界とは違う何処か異世界への憧れが強かった。


　　そんな生活も高校に入ると一変する。&lt;br&gt;
　　彼女は（この手の人間にありがちだが）成績優秀だった。その為少し&lt;br&gt;

Sumireko Usami

Species: High-school girl&lt;br&gt;
Ability: Capable of manipulating psychic powers

She was a genuine psychic.

Thanks to the sense of omnipotence common to youths who furthered their knowledge via the internet, and to the talents she was born with, she began to think that "she was superior to other people," particularly around the time when she was in middle school.

It wasn't to say that friends were ''useless'' or anything.&lt;br&gt;
It was just that they were useful to have from a simple knowledge standpoint.&lt;br&gt;
What she really thought was that "friends are beneficial for the sort of people who actually ''need'' them. Like, the sort of people who want others to flock around them."&lt;br&gt;
In the back of her mind, she mocked them.

Thus, unable to make any friends, (although she herself would frame it as "I didn't make any because I just didn't need any",) she lived a school life that others would view as tragic, but she herself was enriched by.

It was around that time that she began research of her own.&lt;br&gt;
Why she could use psychic powers, occult phenomena, that which we call 'urban legends', et cetera.&lt;br&gt;
In particular, she developed a strong interest in worlds separate from our own.

When she entered high school, her lifestyle instantly changed.&lt;br&gt;
She was a model student (not uncommon for people such as her), and as a result, she advanced to a somewhat isolated private prep school. The school gathered students from all over; having been separated from their previous relationships, they strove to construct those relationships anew. As such, many people tried to strike up friendships with her, model student that she was. Her stiff attitude may have actually contributed to her appeal.

However, she was convinced that she was of a different sort than the other humans around her. Other people, as far as she was concerned, may as well have been demons plotting to form regular relationships with her in order to drag her down to their level.

In a smart move, she ''deliberately'' gathered people around her so as to drive them away.&lt;br&gt;
She formed an unauthorized occult circle: the "Secret Sealing Club".&lt;br&gt;
Just as she expected, nobody came up to her saying they wanted to be friends anymore.

The Secret Sealing Club was a circle dedicated to exposing the secrets of other worlds with their own power.&lt;br&gt;
As a result, she made contact with the deep secrets of the world.

---and so, various things occurred from there,&lt;br&gt;
and as a result, she became able to enter the world of dreams.

There, she was made to realize that all her knowledge was only superficial. ''Experience'' is the real truth of this world, and her pursuit of factual knowledge was only something to cover for this.

And in that dream, she at last met people who she couldn't look down on.&lt;br&gt;
Thanks to that dream--- no, thanks to Gensokyo, she found herself starting to think that maybe making some friends wouldn't be so bad after all.

....

....

....

...however, there was one thing that remained incomprehensible in the end.&lt;br&gt;
Out of all the power stones that she set up in order to open the door to the other world,&lt;br&gt;
one single stone seemed to have been switched with another.

Whose doing was this?&lt;br&gt;
In the first place, the urban legends manifesting and spreading through Gensokyo were not something that she had planned. The urban legends had taken action such that a hole would be broken in the barrier, in the end, but was that really just a coincidence...?

Perhaps [[Sagume Kishin|someone]] had been attempting to break the barrier from the inside.&lt;br&gt;
Had her power stones been used for [[Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom|someone else's purposes?]]&lt;br&gt;
She never did figure it out.

{{nihongo|'''Sunny Milk'''|サニーミルク|Sanī Miruku}} is the leader of the '''[[Three Fairies of Light]]''' composed of her, [[Luna Child]], and [[Star Sapphire]]. She is a [[fairy]] who currently lives in a tree close to the [[Hakurei Shrine]] with her two partners.

==General Information==
Sunny first appeared in the manga ''[[Touhou Sangetsusei]]'''s first work ''[[Eastern and Little Nature Deity]]'' as one of the three main protagonists, and had the same role throughout the sub-series. She later made an appearance in a game as a boss in ''[[Fairy Wars]]''.

She often pranks [[human]]s; her most common prank is making humans get lost, but she rarely executes them alone, often taking other fairies or her partners along. She also enjoys eavesdropping on others for things that might interest her, like clues for a treasure hunt.

===Personality===
Sunny is described as energetic and very curious. She is also fond of delicious foods and any kind of liquor.

===Abilities===
;Refracting light
[[File:SBND12SunnyLightRedirection.jpg|thumb|150px|Sunny redirecting light in ''[[Strange and Bright Nature Deity]]''.]]
While she is reported to be considerably weak, her power allows her to change the refraction of light, making her able to hide herself or change how an environment looks. In ''[[Strange and Bright Nature Deity]]'', this name was changed to "manipulating sunlight". It is the same as being able to hide herself and make herself invisible. It is a fairy-like ability, mainly used in mischief, but her power gets weaker when the sun is not present, and rain gives away her illusions.

The usage method of this ability has been confirmed to be as followed; by refracting light, she was able to make herself and others unable to be seen, give off light, bend the light of the sun &amp; shine on shadows, and reflect [[danmaku]] that was made of light – she wasn't able to bounce back danmaku other than light. In [[Visionary Fairies in Shrine]], while inside her home, she bent light to see how the front door looked like from outside. Also followed in ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]''; she was able to refract light and change the scenery, make [[human]]s lost in the forest, and upon basking in the sun, was especially quick to recover her wounds; this may be due to the power of the sun. She can also accumulate sunlight inside herself, and release it in another moment. The power of the released light can be strong enough to blind people, generate considerable heath, and even start fires.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Grimoire of Usami]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character Design==
[[File:PMiSS_sunny.jpg|thumb|150px|Sunny Milk in [[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]]]
===Name===
Her full name is {{nihongo|''Sunny Milk''|サニーミルク}}. Sunny's name is based on the element which she draws power from; the sun.

===Design===
Sunny Milk's depiction stayed the same in the entirety of her presence in the series bare for minor changes to her clothes. In ''[[Eastern and Little Nature Deity]]'', she has short red hair braided at the sides of her head with red ribbons, blue eyes, as well as a pair of wings. She wears a red and white dress with long sleeves and frills, along with a pink ribbon attached at the top of the dress. She also wears red shoes, as well as a maid headband between her braids.

In ''[[Strange and Bright Nature Deity]]'', her dress gains additional details; the middle of her sleeves now have red ribbons attached to them, the end of her sleeves now have a red line, and the bottom of her dress now have a white line. Her pink ribbon is changed for a yellow neckerchief and her shoes are now black and white.

In ''[[Strange and Bright Nature Deity]]'', during New Year's eve, Sunny decides that she wants to bond all the fairies together to cause an incident. Sunny decides to crush [[Cirno]]'s house, along with her partners and leaving a flag showcasing images of their faces to show their superiority. Afterwards, Cirno decides to send them a declaration of war, however, the fairy trio believes that it's from the [[human]]s and train for the months to come everyday, believing they would soon fight [[Reimu Hakurei]].

The next spring, they are confronted by Cirno, who was reminded by the fairies flag that they had destroyed her house months prior, resulting in the Fairy War.

;''Hopeless Masquerade''
[[File:Th135Sunny.png|frame|Sunny in ''HM'']]
Sunny made a background cameo appearance in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'' on the [[Hakurei Shrine]], [[Hall of Dreams' Great Mausoleum]] and [[Youkai Tanuki Forest]] stage. On each [[stage]], she is seen with [[Luna Child]] and [[Star Sapphire]] floating and cheering.

==Additional Information==
*Sunny and her partners originally lived in a tree house within the [[Forest of Magic]]. According to the story, the location of the house was quite close to where [[Alice Margatroid]] and [[Marisa Kirisame]] live, making them neighbors despite the fact that they are oblivious to Alice's existence in the beginning of the story.
*[[ZUN]] stated that the reason why he chose Sunny, Luna, and Star as main characters is because the three of them have little fighting abilities, yet are much more outgoing than [[Rinnosuke Morichika]], making them ideal characters for introducing various aspects of [[Gensokyo]]'s daily life that Rinnosuke does not participate in.{{reference needed|ZUN's statement}}
*Sunny, Luna, and Star are the first characters in the series to originally appear in a comic, then later in a game.

{{nihongo|'''Suwako Moriya'''|洩矢　諏訪子|Moriya Suwako}} is the original god of the [[Moriya Shrine]]. Officially the shrine now belongs to [[Kanako Yasaka]], but in Suwako's words she handles most of the divine services while Kanako handles the "sales"&lt;ref&gt;[[Symposium of Post-mysticism/Suwako Moriya]] However, Kanako and the shrine maiden, Sanae Kochiya, carry out the duties of gathering faith. She doesn't come forth of her own volition often. Whether it is because she is bad at marketing faith by herself or some other reason is one of the mysteries of the Moriya Shrine.&lt;/ref&gt;.

==General Information==
Suwako first appeared as the extra [[boss]] of ''[[Mountain of Faith]]''. Unlike Kanako, who is technically a [[divine spirit]] who once had a human form, Suwako is one of the [[Yaoyorozu no Kami]], and thus consists purely of faith. She also controls the [[Mishaguji]], which is one of her main sources of faith from humans.

When a portion of her spirit is enshrined, she takes on the form of a frog. In this form, she can grant various blessings, such as safe travel, financial upturn, and transfiguration.

===Personality===
In contrast to Kanako, Suwako is more laid back and mischievous. She enjoys competing against others, and loses gracefully. Though she feigns ignorance, Suwako is just as capable of scheming as Kanako. Combined with her rarely leaving the shrine, her intentions can be hard to read.

===Abilities===
;Ability to create earthiness
Suwako's ability specifically refers to the element of Kun ({{lang|zh|坤}}), one of the [[wikipedia:ba gua|eight trigrams]] in Taoist philosophy that means creating Earth. Kun is exactly the pinnacle of the native [[god]] and is associated with acceptance, devotion, subtlety, flexibility, and reacting to others rather than acting first. [[Kanako Yasaka]]'s ability to create the "sky" of Bagua, or Qian ({{lang|zh|乾}}), refers to the opposite element. Although ''[[Mountain of Faith]]'' offers little insight into the nature of Suwako's abilities, her attack animations in ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]'' depict her "swimming" through the ground, summoning magma, geysers, various rocks and minerals, growing plants instantly, and bending rivers.&lt;ref&gt;[[Touhou Hisoutensoku/Spell Cards/Suwako Moriya|Touhou Hisoutensoku: Sukawo Moriya's Spell Cards]]&lt;/ref&gt;

;Iron rings
Possibly because of her ability to manipulate minerals, Suwako uses large iron rings as weapons in various attacks. According to [[Hatate Himekaidou]], they are scarily sharp.&lt;ref&gt;[[Double Spoiler/Spell Cards/Level 11|Double Spoiler: Iron Ring "Mythical Ring"]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Backstory==
It is revealed that during ancient times, Suwako was a ruler of a small kingdom and controlled the [[Mishaguji]], who were curse gods that had obtained enormous amounts of faith, cursing birth, harvests, militaries, and many other things. Only Suwako was able to tame them. However, gods from the Yamato (Ancient Japan) invaded her kingdom, saying that they were going to unify all the kingdoms to create a single country known as Japan. Unwilling to let this happen, Suwako resisted and fought with the finest steel weapons of the time. However, [[Kanako]] held out a thin vine, and Suwako's large steel arsenal instantly rusted away. Suwako realized the difference in their divine powers and her defeat; she graciously forfeited and relinquished her kingdom. 

It is said that Sanae is her distant descendant, although Sanae didn't even know it until the events of ''[[Subterranean Animism]]''.

==Character Design==
[[File:ThGKSuwako.png|thumb|left|150px|Suwako in ''[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]]'']]
===Name===
The name {{nihongo|Suwako|諏訪子}} is modified from {{nihongo|[[wikipedia:Lake Suwa|Lake Suwa]]|諏訪湖|Suwa-ko}}, the largest lake in Nagano prefecture. The area also features one of the world's largest geysers. Suwako's family name is probably derived from {{nihongo||洩矢神|Moreyashin|the god Moriya}}, who is said to be the first ancestor of {{nihongo|''Sanae Moriya''|守矢早苗}}, the real person who inspired [[Sanae Kochiya]]. (''Moreya'' is an archaic, alternate pronunciation of ''Moriya''.)

===Design===
Suwako wears a short simple purplish-blue dress with a frog print design, large white sleeves stitched onto the torso, and a white collar. She has medium length blond hair, grey eyes, a light brown wide-brimmed hat with two frog eyes on the top, white kneehighs and black shoes. Originally unofficial, Suwako has been shown to wear [http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZettaiRyouiki Zettai Ryouiki] in ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]'' and ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]''.

==Appearances==
===Games===
;''Mountain of Faith''
[[File:Th10SuwakoSprite.png|frame|Suwako's sprite in ''MoF'']]
:{{Main|Mountain of Faith/Story/Reimu's Extra|l1=Reimu Arc|Mountain of Faith/Story/Marisa's Extra|l2=Marisa Arc}}
Reimu and Marisa hear rumors about a second god residing in the Moriya Shrine.  Both heroines set out for the shrine to confirm the rumor when they meet Suwako.  Suwako explains that the Moriya Shrine was originally solely hers and that she's the one who administers divine blessings/curses whereas Kanako tends to act as the face of the shrine.  She also reveals that Kanako was the god who moved the shrine to Gensokyo.  After subjecting the heroines to a "danmaku festival" and being impressed by their skills, she decides to stay in Gensokyo. 

;''Subterranean Animism''
In Subterranean Animism, Suwako appeared in [[Subterranean Animism/Translation/Reimu and Yukari's Extra|Reimu and Yukari's Scenario]] as well as [[Subterranean Animism/Translation/Reimu and Aya's Extra|Reimu and Aya's Scenario]], revealing an industrial revolution project by [[Kanako Yasaka|Kanako]] that caused Reimu to get mad for being sent to the Hell of Blazing Fires.

;''Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom''
Suwako makes another appearance in [[Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom]], this time in Sanae's ending if you have lost a life playing Legacy Mode. Suwako arrives while Kanako was training Sanae to become better at danmaku dodging, saying that she has found a conclusion for the analysis she has done with the [[Ultramarine Orb Elixir]]. Suwako declares the elixir to be dangerous to a native god like her since it also had the effect of purifying the past. Apparently, if Sanae were to take it, it would leave her a "pure human".

===Spin-off games===
;''Touhou Hisoutensoku''
:{{Main|Touhou Hisoutensoku/Translation/Sanae's Scenario#Stage Final|l1=Sanae Arc}}
In ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]'', Suwako was the final [[boss]] of [[Sanae Kochiya]]'s scenario, but also as an aid for Sanae to attack her opponent (including herself). She was aware of the true nature of the vanishing giant seen roaming around Gensokyo, that being [[Hisoutensoku]] and was confronted by Sanae over this and other secretive actions Suwako was involved in. She is also a playable character in arcade and versus modes. Despite the last stage status and having a diverse set of attacks, she is regarded as a bottom-tier character in essentially every Soku tier listing.

;''Double Spoiler''
In ''[[Double Spoiler]]'', Suwako appeared as a [[stage]] 11 target, where she uses a few [[spell card]]s and had [[Aya Shameimaru]] and [[Hatate Himekaidou]] take photos of her and her [[danmaku]].

;''Hopeless Masquerade''
[[File:Th135Suwako.png|frame|Suwako in ''HM'']]
Suwako made a background cameo appearance in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'' on the [[Genbu Ravine]] and [[Youkai Tanuki Forest]] stage. She is seen standing next to [[Sanae Kochiya]] hopping.

;''Impossible Spell Card''
:{{Main|Impossible Spell Card#Story|l1=Impossible Spell Card: Story}}
After apparently reading the newspaper by the [[tengu]] about a mischief-making [[amanojaku]], she becomes one of the many strong beings to try and stop [[Seija Kijin]]. She uses [[spell card]]s that are considered impossible to dodge.
===Literature===
;''Wild and Horned Hermit''
Suwako is interrogated by [[Kasen Ibara]] after she suspected to be involved in the construction of the dam at the foot of [[Youkai Mountain]]. Suwako confirms her suspicions, saying that the landslide is artificial and its true use is to create an artificial lake needed for another base for the [[Moriya Shrine]]. However, the incompetence of the kappas obligated the cancellation of the project.&lt;ref&gt; Chapter 4 [[Wild and Horned Hermit]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationships==
;[[Kanako Yasaka]]
While Suwako claims to still hold a grudge against Kanako for taking over her shrine, her own faith actually increased as a result. By now they've become good friends.

;[[Sanae Kochiya]] 
Sanae acts as a wind priestess under Suwako and is able to summon her. Sanae is also Suwako's descendant, though Sanae was initially unaware of the fact.

;[[Utsuho Reiuji]]
She was presumably present when Kanako presented the Yatagarasu to Utsuho.

;[[Mishaguji]]
Suwako was the one who tamed the Mishaguji, and she's the only one who can control them.

;[[Hisoutensoku]]
It's implied that Suwako was involved in Hisoutensoku's construction.

==Additional Information==
[[File:GoMIllus-Suwako.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Suwako, as illustrated in ''[[The Grimoire of Marisa]]'']]
*[[Kanako Yasaka]] and Suwako are described in ''[[Silent Sinner in Blue]]'' Chapter 6 as gods that have a body. Having a body is likely why they can move and act so independently as opposed to gods who need a vessel, although they are still capable of splitting their spirit when summoned and called upon like all Japanese gods.
*Chapter 19 of ''[[Silent Sinner in Blue]]'' implies that the [[Lunarians]] are using shimenawa to seal away a god at the [[Moriya Shrine]]. It's unknown if Suwako is aware of this. Her win quote to [[Reisen Udongein Inaba]] in ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]'' merely has her commenting, "I heard that there are all kinds of gods where you come from."
*Suwako's strongest [[spell card]] in ''Touhou Hisoutensoku'' resembles the ultimate attack of [[wikipedia:Akuma (Street Fighter|Akuma]] from ''[[Wikipedia:Street Fighter|Street Fighter]]'', the [http://streetfighter.wikia.com/wiki/Shun_Goku_Satsu Shun Goku Satsu].
*In ''Touhou Hisoutensoku'', one of her palettes is a homage to [[Hina Kagiyama]]. She also seems to have another alternate color palettes that resembles the fan-made character [[Fan-made characters/Maybell|Maybell]].
*The frogs printed on Suwako's dress were taken from [[Wikipedia:Chōjū-jinbutsu-giga|Chōjū-giga]], the picture scrolls drawn in 12th century.
*Suwako's theme "Native Faith" is an homage to "Boss6", the BGM used in an STG released by [[Wikipedia:Taito Corporation|Taito]] in 1989, {{nihongo|''Night Striker''|ナイトストライカー}}.
*Suwako does not have any actual connection to frogs, but she likes frogs and her spirit is sometimes invoked in the form of a frog.

　　神奈子は信仰心が得られないのならと、この王国を自分の物にするのは諦めた。代わりに新しい神様を呼び洩矢の神と融合させて、その神様を王国の中では『守矢（もりや）』、外では別の呼び名で呼び分ける事にした。これにより王国を支配しているように見せたのだ。

　　守矢とは勿論、洩矢の事である。そして神奈子は、諏訪子の力を借りて自ら山の神様としてこっそり君臨する事になった。



　　この王国を支配したと言われる新しい神様とは、大和の神話の名目を保たせる為の名前だけの神であった。実際は、諏訪子が引き続き王国を支配していたのである。現在外の世界の神様は殆どが大和神話に置き換わったというのに、彼女は未だ古代の姿のままひっそりと信仰を得ていた。




　　しかしながら、その長きに渡って得続けた信仰も、科学の時代となるとどんどんと失われていった。


　　諏訪子はさほど気にしていなかったのだが、焦った神奈子は神社ごと幻想郷に持ってくるという荒技を実行してしまった。


　　諏訪子が幻想郷で上手くやっていけるのか判らなかったが、最後の遊びとして楽しむ事にした。何故、勝手に王国を捨て、幻想郷にやってきた神奈子と揉めなかったのかというと、もう外の世界には未練が無
かったからである。自分の名前を知っている人間は殆ど居なかった。


　　何せ、最も近い人間であるはずの早苗ですら、諏訪子の事をよく判っていないのだ。


　　早苗は今では神奈子の巫女であるが、奇跡を呼ぶ事が出来るのは彼女が実は、諏訪子の遠い子孫だからである。

　　にもかかわらず、早苗は何故自分の神社に二人の神様がいるのかですらよく判っていないという有様だ。


　　もはや、諏訪子は忘れ去られようが何だろうが構わなかった。むしろ幻想郷で第二の人生を送る事が出来そうで、実際は神奈子に感謝している。





　　さて、神奈子は風の神でありながら、何故蛇を模したしめ縄をトレードマークにしたのだろうか？


　　その理由は二つある。


　　一つは、蛇が再生の意味を持っていたから。ミシャグジ様の恐怖に対抗する為だ。



　　そして、もう一つは……。

　　諏訪子に勝った事をさり気なくアピールする為だった。


　　なんでかって？

　　諏訪子は蛙の姿をした神であり、そして蛇は蛙を食べる動物だからである。

　　新しい王国の神事にも、蛙を生け贄にする事などを盛り込み、人間に『この王国は蛙に代わって蛇が支配した』とアピールし続けた。



　　これが、諏訪子と神奈子がよく喧嘩する原因の一つだった。


　　本当は利害も一致しているし、凄く仲がよい。
| translation = '''Extra Boss  The Highest of Native Gods'''&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;!-- "Top of Native Gods" may sounds strange. However "土着神の頂点" is originally strange, because the term "頂点" (top/peak/summit) is not usually used in this way even in Japanese. ZUN prefers strange use of terms like this. --&gt;
'''Suwako Moriya'''

Species: God&lt;br/&gt;
Ability: Creating earth

The true god of the Shrine of Moriya(守矢).
She is the God of Mountains, and was once the leader of the many gods that lived in the Mountains.

During ancient times, she was a god in control of "Mishaguji".
Mishaguji were curse gods who had obtained enormous amounts of faith, cursing birth, harvest, military, and many other things. Making light of these fearsome gods would lead to divine punishment. The only one able to tame these gods was Suwako. Because of this, she gained an extraordinary amount of faith, and cultivated a kingdom as its ruler while still being a god.

However, many other gods of Yamato (ancient Japan) invaded her kingdom. One of those gods was [[Kanako Yasaka|Kanako]]. The many gods of Yamato continually conquered the small kingdom for themselves. They said that ultimately, they would unify all countries and create a single country called Japan.

Naturally, Suwako resisted and fought with the finest iron weapons of the time. However, Kanako held out a thin vine, and Suwako's large iron arsenal instantly rusted. Suwako realized the difference in their divine powers and her defeat. She valiantly forfeited and relinquished her kingdom.

And so, Kanako attained the kingdom of Moriya(洩矢).

However, the people of Moriya(洩矢) could not forget the fear of their native gods, Mishaguji, and were unable to accept their new god.

Kanako thought she could not gain the faith of the people, and gave up on making the kingdom hers. Instead, she called forth a new god and combined it with Moriya's(洩矢) god. Within the kingdom, this new god was called Moriya(守矢), but was called by a different name outside of the kingdom. This way, it seemed as if it was ruling the kingdom. Moriya(守矢) is, of course, Moriya(洩矢). And thus Kanako borrowed Suwako's powers, and silently ruled as the God of Mountains.

The new god that was said to have reigned over the kingdom was a god only in name, existing only to preserve the legend of Yamato. In reality, Suwako continued to rule over the kingdom. Although the gods of the modern world have mostly been replaced by the Yamato Legends, she is still in her original form discreetly gathering faith.


However, the faith she has gathered throughout the eras is slowly fading with the introduction of the era of science.

Suwako didn't mind so much, but Kanako panicked and moved the whole [[Moriya Shrine|shrine]] to [[Gensokyo]].

Suwako didn't know how well she could get by in Gensokyo, but she decided to enjoy it as her final amusement. The reason she didn't argue with Kanako for deserting the kingdom and coming to Gensokyo was because she had no regrets left in the outer world. There were few people that knew her name.

After all, even the closest human to Suwako, [[Sanae Kochiya|Sanae]], doesn't know much about her.

Sanae is currently Kanako's [[Shrine Maiden]], but the reason she can create miracles is because she is Suwako's distant descendant. Despite this, she does not seem to understand why there are two gods within her own shrine.

Suwako didn't care whether or not she was fated to be forgotten anymore. She's actually thankful to Kanako as it seems she'll be able to enjoy a second life in Gensokyo.


Now, Kanako is the God of wind, but why is a snake-patterned rope her trademark?

There are two reasons.

The first is because the snake symbolizes reincarnation. It was to oppose the fear of Mishaguji.


And the second reason is because... She wanted to casually stress the fact that she won against Suwako.

Why, you ask?
Suwako is a god that takes the form of a frog, and snakes eat frogs. Rituals of the new kingdom included sacrificing frogs to state that "The Snake now rules this kingdom in place of the Frog."


This is one reason why Suwako and Kanako argue a lot.

They share common interests and are actually very good friends.

| translation = The Troublesome Mysterious Gods&lt;br /&gt;
Kanako Yasaka and Suwako Moriya.&lt;br /&gt;
They are the gods that recently moved their shrine to the top of the Youkai Mountain.

They are the start of this story.

——The Kappas' Energy Revolution

The plan by this name has safely concluded its first phase and is on its way towards practical implementation.

The plan involved using the now-dormant [[Remains of Blazing Hell|Blazing Hell]] as a super-high temperature furnace in an attempt to tame a power that it is said the [[outside world]] won't attain for hundreds of years: nuclear fusion energy.

The first step was to find an exemplary hell raven.&lt;br /&gt;
Then, to bestow upon it the personification of the sun, Yatagarasu.&lt;br /&gt;
Then, to rekindle the flames of the Remains of Blazing Hell.&lt;br /&gt;
Then, to tame the crow.

The geyser was proof of the plan's success.

Unlike fission energy, fusion reactions are less likely to go out of control. In addition, it doesn't create such lethal waste.&lt;br /&gt;
So, because it is very safe and produces massive amounts of energy, it is an almost dream-like energy production method.

Kanako seems to treat this as just one part of the shrine's operations.

Because they didn't feel the plan was dangerous, the above-ground [[youkai]] did nothing to stop it even once they found out the truth.

However, Reimu, who was made to go underground,&lt;br /&gt;
confronted them and said angrily,&lt;br /&gt;
"Next time, tell everyone about it before you start!"

{{nihongo|'''Taisui Xingjun'''|太歳星君|Taisai Seikun}} is an enigmatic character, only known to be trying to cause a disaster to [[Gensokyo]] in Hong Meiling's dream in ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]''. He is an actual [[god]] in Chinese mythology. 

==Character Design==
===Name===
Taisui Xingjun can mean "Lord of the Year and Age" in both Chinese and Japanese.

===Design===
Taisui Xingjun has no official art and his appearance is unknown. In Chinese mythology, he can be seen in many different ways and is thought to be a male. He represents the planet Jupiter and holds great power.

==Story==
;Touhou Hisoutensoku
[[Hong Meiling]] sees a [[Hisoutensoku|strange creature]] wondering around near the [[Misty Lake]] and believed it was Taisui Xingjun. She was then attacked by minions to drain her energy for the [[Giant Catfish]]'s revival. After the Catfish was defeated, Meiling then battles Taisui and afterwards probably realizes this was all a dream.

{{nihongo|'''Takane Yamashiro'''|山城 たかね|Yamashiro Takane}} is the Stage 2 midboss and [[Boss|boss]] in ''[[Unconnected Marketeers]]''.

==General Information==
===Personality===
She is described as the natural leader of the [[yamawaro]] since she's "slightly more polite" than other members of her society, making her better at negotiating with outsiders.

She appears to be quite guarded around humans, and protective of the yamawaro hideout in general. She does soften quite considerably when engaging in business, however.

===Abilities===
Her ability is that of "manipulating forest [[wikipedia:qi|qi]]" ({{lang|ja|気}} (kanji), sometimes romanized as ''ch'i''). The concept of ''qi'' is found in many east-asian cultures and traditional practices, and most notably Chinese philosophy. It's described as a "life force" which binds all things within nature together. The exact details of her ability are not exactly shown in [[Unconnected Marketeers]], though one can speculate that being able to manipulate the "life force of the forest" would be advantageous to the mountain-dwelling [[yamawaro]], especially given that she is their apparent leader.

==Character Design==
&lt;!--===Origin===
--&gt;
===Name===
Her full name is ''Takane Yamashiro'' ({{lang|ja|山城 たかね}}). ''Yamashiro'' ({{lang|ja|山城}}) is written with characters meaning "mountain" ({{lang|ja|山}}) and "castle" ({{lang|ja|城}}).&lt;br /&gt;''Takane'' is written in hiragana, but it can be interpreted as {{lang|ja|高嶺}} "high peak" and, possibly, {{lang|ja|高値}} "high price", playing into her businessperson motif.

Her name resembles that of [[Nitori Kawashiro]] ({{lang|ja|河城 にとり}}).

===Design===
Takane wears green camo clothing with brown boots and has green wavy hair. She has many pockets along her upper arm and the hem of her dress. A large brown box is strapped onto her back using rope held together by a key in the front. In [[Unconnected Marketeers]] she also holds three cards. Her clothing is similar to [[Nitori Kawashiro]]'s clothing.

==Appearances==
[[File:Th18TakaneSprite.png|frame|right|Takane's sprite in ''[[Unconnected Marketeers|UM]]'']]
===Games===
;''Unconnected Marketeers''

Since all four protagonists of [[Unconnected Marketeers]] are humans, Takane attempts to shoo them off of [[Youkai Mountain]] by insisting humans can't handle the "power" of the cards. Once defeated, however, she seems amiable to bartering for the cards or information on where they might have come from, directing the protagonist to the ''Rainbow Dragon Cave''.

==Relationships==
===Kappa===
The [[kappa]] and [[yamawaro]] are said to have a "healthy rivalry," with both of their respective niches and industrial pursuits being complementary to one another, despite their mutual teasing and jeering. They live in a balanced relationship where the technology of the kappa and the business sense of the yamawaro work well enough together for them to not escalate their rivalry into true hostilities.

===Moriya Shrine===
During the events of [[Unconnected Marketeers]], Takane mentions to [[Sanae Kochiya]] that the yamawaro had helped the [[Moriya Shrine]] set up their cable-car during the events of [[Wild and Horned Hermit]], and generally considers the shrine to be allies of the yamawaro. However, she does appear to be suspicious of Sanae, coveting the cards and fearful of them being confiscated or misused by humans in general.

==Additional Information==
* The Yamawaro first appeared in a chapter of [[Wild and Horned Hermit]]. This is one of the few times the characters of a species was introduced in a mainline game after their species was already introduced.

Business Youkai of the Mountain's Recess&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

'''Takane Yamashiro'''&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Species: Yamawaro&lt;br /&gt;
Ability: Capable of manipulating forest ''qi''&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

One of numerous humanoid youkai who live in the mountains. Their inherent nature as a youkai resembles that of the kappa.&lt;br /&gt;
They build hide-outs in the depths of the Youkai Mountain, within which they live a communal lifestyle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

They're specialists at living in forests and are quite technologically advanced.&lt;br /&gt;
In spite of being forest-dwellers, they're making progress in economic research, and have built a complicated system of currency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

They have a healthy rivalry with the kappa, and the two groups call each other things like "you lousy river-dwelling amphibians" and "you stinking forest monkeys".&lt;br /&gt;
The kappa wouldn't be able to complete their machines without the yamawaro, and the yamawaro's businesses would wither away unused without the kappa's manufacturing.&lt;br /&gt;
The two groups are dependent on each other, both in technology and in business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Takane is a leader-esque presence amongst the yamawaro.&lt;br /&gt;
As for why? People say it's because she speaks just a tiny bit more politely than others of her kind.

'''Tenma''' ({{lang|ja|天魔}}) is an enigmatic character, only known to be the chief of the [[tengu]] on the [[Youkai Mountain]]. They were first mentioned as the Tengu boss in the Tengu section of [[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]].

==Concept==
===Name===
The first character of ''Tenma'', ''Ten'' ({{lang|ja|天}}) means "heaven" and the second, ''ma'' ({{lang|ja|魔}}) means "demon".

When the Hindi god [[Wikipedia:Mara (demon)|Māra]] was adapted to Japanese Buddhism, it was translated as "{{lang|ja|天魔}}" (temma), the abbreviation form of "{{lang|ja|第六天魔王}} (dai-roku temma-ou) — '''Mā'''ra ({{lang|ja|'''魔'''羅}}), the '''king''' ({{lang|ja|'''王'''}}) of the '''sixth dimension of god's living''' ({{lang|ja|'''第六天'''}}), which is the top dimension of the desire world. He was originally a Buddhist god, but Japanese people have had him identified with tengu, so he was commonly seen to be the boss of tengu.


Tenma is sometimes confused with the term "[[Tengu|great tengu]]" who are a management type of tengu (see {{PMiSS|Page|Tengu}}).

==Story==
;''Mountain of Faith''
:{{Main|Mountain of Faith/Story|l1=Mountain of Faith Story}}
In ''Mountain of Faith'', the great tengu (management types, not to be confused with the boss tengu, Tenma) receives a report from Momiji about intruders on the mountain and sends her and Aya to investigate. After discovering that they weren't hostile, Tenma and the Mountain God (presumably [[Kanako Yasaka|Kanako]]) decided to pursue friendly relations, though the full details of the discussion were kept secret.

{{nihongo|'''Tenshi Hinanawi'''|比那名居　天子|Hinanawi Tenshi}} is the main antagonist of [[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]. She's the {{nihongo|"Eldest Daughter"|総領娘|souryou musume}} of the Hinanawi clan, as referred to by [[Iku Nagae]], that resides in [[Heaven]]. Being in heaven, she has a rather carefree life which she considers boring.
{{TOC limit|n=3}}

==General Information==
Tenshi first appeared in [[Reimu Hakurei]]'s scenario as the final [[boss]] of the fighting game ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]'' and was a recurring final boss for most other characters; she's also an unlockable playable character. She later appeared as a target in ''[[Double Spoiler]]'', was a background character in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'' and was one of the Final Day bosses in ''[[Impossible Spell Card]]''. Like some other characters, Tenshi was left out of ''[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]]'' because "they have nothing to do with [[Kanako Yasaka|Kanako]], [[Byakuren Hijiri|Hijiri]] or [[Toyosatomimi no Miko|Miko]]".&lt;ref name="SoPmInterview"&gt;[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]]: [[Symposium of Post-mysticism/Interview|Bonus interview]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personality===
In her official profile, Tenshi is described as being "sheltered upbringing", selfish and top of the world. Despite being a [[celestial]], she is very earthly and lacks charisma. That's not surprising, however, because she became a celestial only because the entire Hinanawi family became celestials when the Nawi became divine spirits. Therefore, she lacks awareness of what it means to be a celestial.

She is described as "delinquent". An overly privileged environment had a negative effect on her playful nature. She doesn't consider what her actions mean to other people. She also has absolute confidence in her abilities, and gets mad if someone insults them. [[ZUN]] jokingly described her as having "a rather 'nice' personality."&lt;ref name="SoPmInterview"/&gt;

===Abilities===
; Strength
Although it's not because Tenshi has undergone special training, she is extraordinarily strong and tough. This toughness is to the extent that she cannot be pierced by [[Sakuya Izayoi]]'s knives&lt;ref&gt;[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]] - [[Scarlet_Weather_Rhapsody/Story/Tenshi%27s_Scenario|Tenshi's Scenario]]&lt;/ref&gt;. This seems to be an effect of heavenly peaches; when one eats them, it forges one's body to one's convenience. [[Heaven]] doesn't have normal food apart from the peaches, so all [[celestial]]s probably eat these peaches and strengthen their bodies.

;Manipulating the Earth
Earthquakes, land subsidence, landslides, etc. - her effective range is narrow, but she is able to manipulate them at will. It is similar to [[Suwako Moriya]]'s "creating kun (the Earth)", but Suwako's ability is mainly for the sake of constructing various geographical features and creating countries, whereas Tenshi's ability is mainly a power to calm and cause (land-related) natural disasters. 

;Identifying one's spirit 
By using the [[Sword of Hisou]], she can identify one's spirit no matter what the circumstances. 

; Ability to manipulate "sky, earth and people"

Even with just the keystone and the Sword of Hisou, she would still probably still be able to manipulate all three of "sky, earth and people". The Sword of Hisou has power related to "sky" and "people", and the keystone has power related to "Earth". 

===Possessions===
; [[Keystones]]
[[File:Th105Keystone.png|thumb|right|100px|Keystones come in different sizes and shapes.]]
A {{nihongo|Keystone|要石|kaname-ishi}} is a holy rock object that can (among other properties) invoke or suppress earthquakes, wrapped in [[shimenawa]]. Based on what Eirin Yagokoro said, it is a heavy object made of black granite. Only those of Hinanawi households are able to handle, insert and remove the keystone before they became celestials, and other [[celestials]] are not able to use it. Tenshi uses keystones in many ways, including: as danmaku weapons, launched as a drill, as a cushion to sit on, as a bludgeon to attack with and for standing on. As the keystone was originally for calming earthquakes, if the keystone, which stores distorted energy of the Earth, was ever removed or destroyed, then an earthquake occurs. Since causing earthquakes in this manner takes time and is difficult to use in battle, that is probably the reason it wasn't used much in battle.

; [[Sword of Hisou]]
[[File:TenshiSwordofHisou.JPG|thumb|left|150px|Tenshi and her sword, as shown in ''[[Grimoire of Marisa]]''.]]

The Sword of Hisou is a [[celestial]] tool and one of Tenshi's tools. The sword cannot be used other than by celestials. It is able to gather and accumulate the surrounding spirit and convert it into energy. Moreover, it is able to cut up this spirit itself. Upon releasing the opponent's spirit and identifying the type of the opponent's spirit, it is also able to control the accumulated spiritual energy and convert it into the spirit of the opponent's weakness, and attack using their weakness. First, the sword converts the opponent's spiritual nature into scarlet mist, then into a form that can be seen. Once the opponent's nature has been revealed, the sword can change itself to channel the most effective attributes to counter that nature. The spiritual nature evoked by the sword takes the form of weather, which is why it somehow looks flexible. Also, spirits slashed by the sword become scarlet mist. This mist can be used to influence and control the weather. The sword is also durable enough to channel the powerful strength of the celestials, allowing Tenshi to rupture the Earth or even cause earthquakes in the surrounding area. Tenshi can also evoke the gathered scarlet energies of living beings through the sword, creating an immensely destructive beam that inflicts grievous injury upon her opponents. The fact that Tenshi can draw the weapon from seemingly nowhere, it means that the shape-shifting properties of the sword does not have to be stored anywhere on Tenshi's body at any time without taking up space, suggesting that it is spiritually summoned into battle by its wielder.

==Backstory==
Tenshi was originally a human named Chiko and was part of the Hinanawi clan who served the Nawi clan. When the Nawi clan passed away, they were enshrined as divine spirits and became the Nawi-No-kami. Due to this, the entire Hinanawi clan ascended to Heaven as a reward for serving the Nawi clan, and they became celestials. 

However, because they became celestials by serving the Nawi clan, as opposed to training, they lacked the reputation expected of a celestial and were labeled as "bad" celestials. 
Chiko also ascended to a celestial with her family despite being so young. It was here she renamed herself "Tenshi". However, because she lacked any training or discipline of a celestial, she became incredibly spoiled, to the point she found the Heaven that so many on earth desired, boring, and ended up envying the exciting life of people on earth.

==Character Design==
[[File:MAGNet 20100502 4 Tenshi.jpg|thumb|right|220px|A sketch by [[ZUN]], shown on MAGNet.]]
===Name===
Her full name is {{nihongo||比那名居　天子|Tenshi Hinanawi}}. In {{nihongo||天子|Tenshi}}, it has {{nihongo||天|ten|"sky, heaven"}} and {{nihongo||子|shi|"child"}}, which is a common ending for girl's names, so the literal meaning of her first name is "The child of heaven". Incidentally, the word {{nihongo||天子|tenshi}} is used to refer to the [[wikipedia:monarch|monarch]] in both Japanese and Chinese language. Also, ''Tenshi'' can be interpreted as an {{nihongo|"[[wikipedia:angel|angel]]"|天使|tenshi}} in Japanese, a likely reference to her being a [[Celestial]] in this case. {{nihongo||天|Ten}} is a kanji used in the Japanese title of ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]'' ({{lang|ja|緋想'''天'''}}).

Meanwhile in her surname, {{nihongo||比那|hina}} may be from the {{nihongo|"Hina Tori-no-Mikoto"|比那鳥命}} of Hina shrine in [[wikipedia:Izumo, Shimane|Izumo city]], Shimane prefecture of Japan, from a legend of a goddess, and it may be a name to indicate her characteristics of "female" and "earthquakes". However, as Hina has a father, it cannot be said that the entire family is female. "Hina" could also mean {{nihongo|"young chicken, small"|雛}}.It's pronunciation can also mean {{nihongo|"Goddess"|此売|hina}}

{{nihongo||名居|Nawi}}, also called {{nihongo|"Nai/Nawi no Kami"|名居守}}, is pronounce similarly to {{nihongo||ない|nai}}. It's an obsolete word meaning "Earth", and {{nihongo|名居振る|nawifuru}} meant "earthquake", which can be found in the [[wikipedia:Nihon Shoki|Nihon Shoki]]. "Furu" meant, like how it is read, to shake or vibrate. In a shift, "Nawi" acquired the meaning of "earthquakes", and was thus worshiped as a god of earthquakes. The "[[wikipedia:Wi (kana)|wi]]" ({{lang|ja|ゐ}}) in ''Hinanawi'' ({{lang|ja|比那名居}}) is a kana that is unused in [[wikipedia:Modern Japanese|Modern Japanese]]. In present day Japanese, her last name is pronounced "Hinanai". Also, another meaning of "Hinanawi" is "The Goddess of Earthquake".

Before becoming a celestial, her first name was {{nihongo||地子|Chiko|lit. "earth child"}}.

===Design===
Tenshi has dark red eyes and long blue hair. She wears a white button-up blouse with a red bow at the collar; a blue dress with a light blue bow on the back and brown lace-up boots similar to those of [[Alice Margatroid]]'s. The apron she carries on her dress has a rainbow-patterned shard link around it, and she wears a black hat decorated with two peaches and leaves. Supposedly, Tenshi should have a cloud pattern on her skirt, similar to the one on [[Utsuho]]'s, [[Toyosatomimi no Miko|Miko]]'s and [[Sumireko]]'s capes, but due to lack of time it wasn't implemented.
In [[Antinomy of Common Flowers]], her skirt now features the cloud pattern. She also appears to be very short in height in this game (Which is pointed out by [[Mamizou Futatsuiwa]])

==Appearances==
===Spin-offs===
;''Scarlet Weather Rhapsody''
:{{Main|Scarlet Weather Rhapsody/Story#Tenshi.27s_Story|l1=Scarlet Weather Rhapsody Story}}
Due to the boring life in Heaven of constant drinking and relaxation, Tenshi decides to cause a disaster by gathering the thought energy of everyone in [[Gensokyo]] in the form of scarlet clouds, threatening an earthquake. Her true intent is to resolve her boredom by attracting others to resolve the incident. This disruption causes a preliminary tremor, which wrecks [[Reimu Hakurei]]'s shrine and causes several events to unfold from there. Eventually, Tenshi rebuilds Reimu's shrine. However, [[Yukari Yakumo]] becomes angry when she learns that Tenshi has built a [[Keystone]] into its foundation, and has the shrine destroyed and rebuilt once more so that she can seal it.&lt;ref&gt;[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]] - Yukari's Scenario&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually a groundbreaking ceremony is held in [[Heaven]], attended by most of the game's playable characters.

The weather type Aurora, meaning "Northern (or Southern) Lights", is associated to Tenshi.

;''Double Spoiler''
[[File:Th125TenshiSprite.png|frame|Tenshi's sprite in ''DS'']]
[[File:Th135Tenshi.png|frame|Tenshi in ''HM'']]
In ''[[Double Spoiler]]'', Tenshi used her [[keystone]]s as [[danmaku]] in her [[spell card]]s and had [[Aya Shameimaru]] and [[Hatate Himekaidou]] taking photos of her and her danmaku.

;''Hopeless Masquerade''
Tenshi made a background cameo appearance in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'' on the [[Palanquin Ship]] and [[Youkai Tanuki Forest]] [[stage]]. She is seen standing on a [[keystone]] while hovering in the air.

;''Impossible Spell Card''
:{{Main|Impossible Spell Card#Story|l1=Impossible Spell Card: Story}}
After apparently reading the newspaper by the [[tengu]] about a mischief-making [[amanojaku]], she becomes one of the many strong [[youkai]] and [[human]]s to try and stop [[Seija Kijin]] in the final day. She uses [[spell card]]s that are considered impossible to dodge.

;''Antinomy of Common Flowers''
:{{Main|Antinomy of Common Flowers#Story|l1=Antinomy of Common Flowers: Story}}
Tenshi, exiled from Heaven, teams up with [[Shinmyoumaru Sukuna]] to become the strongest Perfect Posession user in Gensokyo. Later, Tenshi's [[Dream World]] self appears with plans to destroy the world in anger; [[Joon Yorigami|Joon]] and [[Shion Yorigami]] must defeat her.

===Literature===
;''Wild and Horned Hermit''
After being the host along with [[Shion Yorigami]] of a banquet remembered by its poor quality, she appears again to try to get [[Reimu Hakurei]] back from Avicii. After helping her to find a way to defeat [[Kasen Ibara]], she decides to keep the real hermit's identity in secret, afraid that knowing of the existence of an [[oni]] hermit could make a fuss in [[heaven]].

;''Alternative Facts in Eastern Utopia''
Tenshi explains in her article how celestials, although they live a luxurious life, are also people with big spirit, something they obtained abandoning their desires and insatisfactions. In what respects to food, she complains that said satisfaction leads to all celestials eating only peaches, and she explains that she doesn't have that satisfaction and that she doesn't understand what's the problem of trying new gastronomy.

==Relationships==
===[[Suika Ibuki]]===
Suika travelled up to [[Heaven]] and beat up Tenshi to get some land. Iku mentions in her ending that Tenshi must have given it to her without consulting any of the other celestials about the matter. Since then, Suika played at least one prank on Tenshi by gathering up many others to come fight her. Tenshi initially figured that it'd be okay because Suika will get bored and leave heaven soon, but by the time the final story (Tenshi's) in ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]'' ends, Suika's still up there, causing Tenshi to worry about just how long the [[oni]] plans on staying.

===[[Iku Nagae]]===
Iku comments to Tenshi that she was supposed to file a report before warning everyone about the earthquake, but couldn't because all of the Hinanawi clan were away from their homes. This implies that one of her duties is to file reports to the Hinanawi clan when an earthquake is about to occur (note, however, that this doesn't mean she is subservient to Tenshi's clan. Just that her job requires interacting with them). It is shown in her ending that she saw how spoiled and reckless the eldest child Tenshi was, and was never happy about it.

Her win quote to Tenshi implies that Iku often complained to Tenshi about how mad her father was whenever Iku reported him. To Tenshi, however, Iku was just a messenger. Tenshi's unauthorized use of a keystone finally caused Iku to take action and punish Tenshi (and for Tenshi to learn her name), although having no authority over a member of the Hinanawi meant that all Iku could do in the long term was complain about it.

===[[Shion Yorigami]]===
After the events of [[Antimony of Common Flowers]], Tenshi and Shion end up developing a strong and deep relationship with each other. Initially, Tenshi's brash attitude and privileged upbringing made Shion too shy to question her about even basic facts. Over the events of later [[Wild and Horned Hermit]] chapters, Tenshi had slowly grown more understanding and accommodating of Shion's shyness. Recently, the pair of them have regularly attended Hakurei Shrine parties together, and are practically inseparable. 

Tenshi's natural "good luck" as a celestial is apparently not cancelled out by Shion's natural "bad luck" due to being a poverty god. 

===Her Father, Lord Nai===
Iku mentions to Tenshi in a win quote that there's been repeated occasions where she's told Tenshi that her father was mad, and snaps that Tenshi should go report to him by herself for a change.

==Additional Information==
[[File:AWATenshiShirt.jpg|thumb|175px|Tenshi on the AWA shirt, by [[ZUN]].]]
*A silhouette of Tenshi occupies the front of ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]'''s jewel case, as well as the [[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody OST|OST]].
*Her profile mentions "Oomura no Kami" and "Nai clan". In fact, there is the {{nihongo|'''Nai''' Shrine|名居神社}} in [[wikipedia:Nabari, Mie|Nabari City]], and the {{nihongo|Oomura Shrine|大村神社}} in [[wikipedia:Iga, Mie|Iga City]], both in [[wikipedia:Mie Prefecture|Mie Prefecture]]. The former shrine stands in {{nihongo|Shimo-'''hina'''chi|下比奈知}}, and the latter has the [[Keystone]] and the Statue of Catfish as [[Wikipedia:Shintai|goshintai]].
*Many of the mythological references Tenshi makes are those to the {{nihongo||天部|Tenbu|Deva in sanskrit}}. In Buddhism, Deva are humans that have achieved enlightenment, and in ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]'', Tenshi mentions the five signs of death of a Deva. Devas are also known to be mortal in Buddhism, living long lives, but still remaining part of the circle of life and death. This too, ties in with the events in Komachi's scenario in the game. Considering earlier references by [[ZUN]] to the Tennin (such as [[Perfect Cherry Blossom/Spell Cards/Stage 5#Spell Card 085|several of Youmu's spell cards]] in ''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]''), both Tenbu and Tennin are the same in [[Gensokyo]].
*One of her color palettes in ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]'' resembles [[Renko Usami]].
*[[ZUN]] designed the official shirt for the 2013 [[wikipedia:Anime Weekend Atlanta|Anime Weekend Atlanta]] convention. Tenshi appears on the shirt because the US state of [[wikipedia:Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] is known as the ''Peach State'', which is appropriate.
*In the heaven [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journey_to_the_West Journey to the west] describes the only available food to eat were peaches and they seemed to have the same effect on those who ate it to the point where they were the raw material for the making of the immortality elixir. 
*During the events of [[Antinomy of Common Flowers]], one of the spellcards used by Tenshi's dream self features the [[Giant Catfish]], which is a species known as [[Namazu]]. Due to Tenshi's ability to manipulate the earth and cause earthquakes, she is associated with the Namazu because in Japanese folklore, they also have the ability to cause earthquakes.

A delinquent celestial living in the heavens.

The Hinanawi clan used to be a family of priests who were tasked to protect their keystone, which kept earthquakes under control.

However, even with the Hinanawi keystone, earthquakes occurred rather often. They occurred so often that it went out of the hands of Oomura-no-Kami, a celestial who was in charge of earthquakes at that time, so the Nawi clan, who had been serving the celestials, was ordered to take over the job around the Gensokyo area.

The Nawi clan was a family of earthbound priests, but were enshrined as divine spirits after their death in a small shrine beside a mountain lake known as Nawi-no-Kami. The Nawi-no-Kami still watch quietly watch over Gensokyo.

At the same time, the Hinanawi clan ascended to the heavens as a reward for serving Nawi-no-Kami when they were still alive.

However, unlike other celestials, the Hinanawis became celestials only by serving Nawi-no-Kami; that is, not through training. So they didn't have the reputation expected of celestials, and some even called them "bad" celestials.

When the Hinanawis became celestials, their daughter Chiko Hinanawi followed them and became a celestial as well, even though she was a young girl.

Chiko renamed herself Tenshi when she moved to heaven. She was not satisfied with how she was treated there, and often looked down on Gensokyo with jealousy toward the humans and youkai living on the ground.

One day, a sudden urge hit her as she saw the youkai on land enjoying using their power to invoke disaster and cause chaos.

"Geez, I'm tired of this boring celestial life! I can invoke a disaster, too!!"

Then she flew from her house, with the [[Sword of Hisou]], a celestial tool, in hand...


Location: [[Heaven]]&lt;br/&gt;
Ability: Manipulating the earth&lt;br/&gt;

Ability to calm or cause earthquakes. Although effective area is not wide, she can cause an earthquake in a remote area as long as it's inside Gensokyo. This ability also allows her to cause disasters such as subsidence or mudslide.

Also, only the Hinanawi clan is allowed to put or remove [[Keystone]]s in Gensokyo.

It is said that upon removal of the Keystones, all the ground in Gensokyo will tremble.


[[Sword of Hisou]]'s ability: Identifying one's spirit

The Sword of Hisou is a celestial-only item that allows the wielder to exploit the opponent's weakness, no matter what. First, the sword converts the opponent's spirit to scarlet mist, then to the form that everyone can see. As the opponent's nature has surfaced, the sword can change itself to the most effective attributes.

Spirit surfaced by the sword takes the form of weather. Spirits slashed by the sword become scarlet mist, then the mist changes the weather.

Tenshi thinks that with her [[Keystone]] and [[Sword of Hisou]], she can control all heaven, earth, and people.


Personality: Had a sheltered upbringing. Selfish. Top of the world.

She is very earthly for a celestial, and lacks charisma. That's not surprising, however, because she became a celestial only because the entire Hinanawi family became celestials when the Nawi became divine spirits. Therefore, she lacks awareness of what it means to be a celestial.

An overly privileged environment obviously had a negative effect on her playful nature. She doesn't consider what her actions mean to other people.

She has absolute confidence in her abilities, and gets mad if someone insults them.

{{nihongo|'''Tewi Inaba'''|因幡　てゐ|Inaba Tewi}} is the leader of the many [[youkai]] [[rabbit]]s that live at and guard [[Eientei]]. She is also considered to be the leader of all the earth rabbits; it's said that there is not a single youkai rabbit unknown to her, and that all of them will only ever listen to her.&lt;ref&gt;Nicopedia - [http://dic.nicovideo.jp/a/因幡てゐ Tewi Inaba] (Retrieved 2012 March 23 at 00:41)&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite her childish appearance, she is very old (at least 3,000 years old). If she really was the [[Wikipedia:Hare of Inaba|White Rabbit of Inaba]], then this would make her one of the oldest characters in the ''[[Touhou Project]]''. 

Tewi is a very lighthearted and playful youkai, and is known to lie at times. In ''[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]'', she even tries to swindle [[Aya Shameimaru]] out of some pocket change.
{{TOC limit|limit=3}}
==General Information==
===Personality===
Tewi is described as being more like a fairy than youkai, with being childish in her way of speaking and acting; specially with [[Reisen Udongein Inaba|Reisen]], who is the target of her pranks and she hides from the moon rabbit to annoy her. However, it's remarkable how Reisen said that the youkai rabbits only follow her &lt;ref name="CiLR"&gt; Chapter 1, ''[[Cage in Lunatic Runagate]]'' &lt;/ref&gt;, which indicates that she has a clear ability of leadership. Furthermore, she is charge of the [[Bamboo Forest of the Lost]], and [[Eirin]], [[Kaguya]] and [[Reisen Udongein Inaba|Reisen]] can live in [[Eientei]] with her permission in exchange of "lending their knowledge on the rabbits" &lt;ref name="CiLR"/&gt; and, as part of the forest, she will defend the mansion, which indicates how clever and loyal she can be. It's also important to remark how she though of selling her own species to humans to help and save them from being abandoned and living poorly as youkais &lt;ref&gt; Chapter 31 ''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'' &lt;/ref&gt;, an idea that proves how she wishes the best for her people.

===Abilities===
;Conferring good luck to humans
Tewi's capable of granting good luck to people who catch sight of her. However, because she lives in the Bamboo Forest of the Lost, few ever manage to see her. Even if they managed to find her, their fortune is instantly used to find their way back home. 

She is also capable of using her luck to her benefit. She could find Eientei even though at that time it was a pure land thanks to her luck. It's also implied that the Bamboo Forest's reputation of making travellers lost is the result of Tewi's ability. &lt;ref&gt; [[Strange Creators of Outer World/Who's Who of Humans &amp; Youkai in Gensokyo/Reisen Udongein Inaba and Tewi Inaba]] &lt;/ref&gt;

===Occupation===
Tewi is in charge of the [[Bamboo Forest of the Lost]], but her duties are unknown. 

==Backstory==
[[File:InabaoftheMoonandInabaoftheEarthTewi.png|thumb|120px|left|Tewi referencing the [[Wikipedia:Hare of Inaba|White Rabbit of Inaba]] on the back of ''[[IoM&amp;IoE]]'']]
After taking good care of her health and living for a long time, Tewi Inaba became a [[youkai]] [[rabbit]]. She had become known as [[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Tewi Inaba|the Rabbit of Good Fortune]] amongst humans, for the good luck she brought them. She is more than 3,000 years old (inferred from a statement she made in Chapter 18 of ''[[Silent Sinner in Blue]]'' where she said she knew [[Wikipedia:Daikokuten|Lord Daikoku]] (also known as Ookuninushi) personally and was confident that he made better medicine than even that which [[Eirin Yagokoro]] was preparing). It's possible that she's the [[wikipedia:Hare of Inaba|White Hare of Inaba]], itself. She has existed since the [[Bamboo Forest of the Lost]] was known as "The Tall Grass Cluster" and is said to be the only being that knows it completely. However, it appears she never found out that Lord Daikoku, whom she reveres so much, was taken captive and is sealed at his shrine in Izumo to this day. She and the earth rabbits continue to pound mochi in his name (much to Reisen's annoyance, who was insisting on them pounding it in a Lunarian figure's name).

Tewi had lived in the Bamboo Forest before [[Eientei]] was built. Despite [[Kaguya Houraisan]]'s power over eternity concealing it, in ''[[Cage in Lunatic Runagate/First_Chapter|Cage in Lunatic Runagate]]'' Tewi said that she knew that it was always there. She finally made herself known to Eirin Yagokoro after a few hundred years. By then, Tewi had already achieved enlightenment. She was master of the Bamboo Forest and the rabbits that lived there.

Eirin and Tewi made a deal. Tewi would protect [[Eientei]] from [[human]]s, and in return, Eirin would spread her knowledge to the rabbits. Perhaps this was so the [[beast]]s could keep up with the [[youkai]], [[Youkai Mountain]], [[human]]s, and (later) [[vampire]]s in [[Gensokyo]]'s delicate power balance in ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Vampire|Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]''.

Tewi abides by that deal to this day, when she isn't playing pranks on [[Reisen Udongein Inaba]] or scamming Gensokyo's general populace, at least.

==Character Design==
[[File:PMiSS tewi.jpg|thumb|160px|Tewi, as illustrated in ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'']]

===Name===
Her full name is {{nihongo|''Tewi Inaba''|因幡てゐ}}. Unlike [[Reisen Udongein Inaba]], the "Inaba" in Tewi's name is written using [[Wikipedia:Kanji|kanji]] which refer to the {{nihongo|[[Wikipedia:Inaba Province|Inaba Province]]|因幡国|Inaba no Kuni}} in historical Japan. Additionally, the legend of the {{nihongo|"[[Wikipedia:Hare of Inaba|White Rabbit of Inaba]]"|因幡の白兎|Inaba no Shirousagi|a.k.a "The Hare of Inaba" in English}} is a story with which Tewi is frequently associated, and may well be the source of her name.

The {{nihongo|''[[Wikipedia:Wi (kana)|wi]]''|ゐ}} in ''Tewi'' is an archaic kana that was struck from the syllabry with the post-WWII orthographic reforms. In Modern Japanese, {{nihongo||ゐ|wi}} is fully homophonous with {{nihongo||い|i}}, meaning that the ''w'' in the romaji is silent. Officially, her name is romanized as ''Tewi'' in ''[[Imperishable Night]]'', but as ''Tei'' in ''[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]'', ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'' and the data files for ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]''.

===Design===
At her debut in ''[[Imperishable Night]]'', she has dark red eyes, black shoulder-length hair, and fluffy white [[rabbit]] ears, and goes barefoot in a frilly pink-white dress. In her playable appearance in ''[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]'', white socks and a carrot necklace are added to this outfit. Her alternative outfit in that game gives her a black dress in place of her pink one.

;[[Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom]]
Tewi Inaba makes another appearance in Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom, but only in Reimu's Pointdevice/No-Death Clear ending. After Reimu leaves Eientei unsatisfied with the conversation she had with [[Eirin Yagokoro]], Tewi appears to her in the Bamboo Forest and asks the shrine maiden questions related to the [[lunarian]]s. Tewi also states her reason for asking was for reference;she wanted to know the lunarians' weak points and she had some "business" to do with them. Reimu didn't know what Tewi was planning, but she knew that the earth rabbit was going to get beaten up by the lunarians or manipulate them using lucrative words, so she was interested, but at the same time, she didn't care because she had done enough business with the lunarians herself.
===Spin-offs===
;''Shoot the Bullet''
[[File:Th095TewiSprite.png|frame|Tewi's sprite in ''StB'']]
In ''[[Shoot the Bullet]]'', [[Aya Shameimaru]] encountered Tewi on [[stage]] 4 and took photos of her [[danmaku]].

;''Hopeless Masquerade''

Tewi made a background cameo appearance in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'' on the [[Human Village]] stage. She is seen sitting on a bench with [[Eirin Yagokoro]], [[Kaguya Houraisan]] and [[Reisen Udongein Inaba]] cheering and drinking alcohol.

;''Urban Legend in Limbo''
Tewi makes a cameo in the PlayStation 4 version of ''[[Urban Legend in Limbo]]'' where she pushes Reisen to the stage on her special animation.

===Literature===
;[[Silent Sinner in Blue]]
Tewi mainly watched the events on the sidelines while managing the earth rabbits pounding mochi for the Monthly Lunar Festival. Eirin's handling of the situation impressed the rabbit. When Eirin indicated she had realized who the true [[Yukari|culprit]] behind the unrest was, Tewi mocked how those earth youkai were trying to invade the Moon again even though they already failed before, and said she was glad she sided with Eirin and the Lunarians that had come to Eientei.

At the end, the culprit, [[Yukari Yakumo]], was captured by [[Watatsuki no Toyohime]], in part thanks to Eirin's intervention. Yukari and [[Ran Yakumo]] were held under arrest by Toyohime, who told them they would make excellent souvenirs on the moon.

The two youkai were tied up with femtofiber fabric, which the Lunarians have always used to bind the impure. As Toyohime explained what femtofiber fabric was, Yukari realized that it was the same as shimenawa rope. Yukari mocked Toyohime's claims of sealing away the impure using shimenawa, pointing out that the Lunarians even sealed away native gods as well. Toyohime was slightly stunned, but clarified, saying that shimenawa were used to seal those who defy the moon. Confused, Ran asked Yukari what she was talking about, causing the boundary youkai to explain that Lunarians first used shimenawa to prevent the sun goddess Amaterasu from returning to the cave she used to hide in, and since then, Lunarians have used the fabric to limit the movements of the impure. Toyohime agreed, saying that this kept the Lunar Capital safe. At that point, Yukari angrily added that shimenawa wasn't used just to seal the impure, but gods as well. As an example, she told Ran that Lord Daikoku was sealed away long ago at his shrine because the heavenly gods, implied to be the Lunarians, feared him after taking his lands. Ran was shocked that Lord Daikoku was sealed away, and remarked that he was the god that the rabbits were always singing about. As proof of her accusation, Yukari pointed out that the shimenawa at Lord Daikoku's shrine in Izumo were too thick to merely seal away something impure, leaving Toyohime speechless. Yukari, now smiling, smugly pointed out that there was shimenawa at the [[Moriya Shrine]] as well, which must have been used to seal away one of Daikoku's sons, Take-Minakata. Ran then realized that must have been why the shimenawa there was so thick.

Fortunately for Toyohime, [[Reisen]] interrupted to tell her the other invaders at the moon had been defeated, and [[Watatsuki no Yorihime]] needed Toyohime to send them away. Toyohime smiled and prepared to return to the moon, but Reisen was ordered to deliver one last letter to Eientei.

At Eientei, rabbits were pounding mochi in Lord Daikoku's name for the latest Monthly Lunar Festival. Reisen arrived, causing them to pause. Tewi wondered what was going on, and Reisen nervously explained and handed her the letter before leaving. After Reisen was gone, Tewi realized that she must have been one of the Lunar emissaries and wondered why the residents of Eientei feared someone that pathetic in the first place. She then proclaimed to the other rabbits that the Lunar emissary was nothing compared to Lord Daikoku, causing them all to laugh, apparently ignorant of what had become of him.

==Relationships==
===[[Kaguya Houraisan]]===
{{Stub|section}}

===[[Eirin Yagokoro]]===
Tewi made a deal with Eirin to defend Eientei in exchange for Eirin imparting her knowledge to the rabbits. Thus Eirin is an ally, employer and teacher to Tewi and Tewi appropriately addresses her as Master. Eirin realizes Tewi's importance to Eientei due to her control over the rabbits and despite Tewi's pranks, knows that Tewi is there whenever they really need her, should the circumstance arise.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cage in Lunatic Runagate]]: [[Cage in Lunatic Runagate/First Chapter|First Chapter]] — "She'd be beside you before you know it, and she'd disappear just as quickly. Still, she'd always be around when you really needed her."&lt;/ref&gt;.

===[[Reisen Udongein Inaba]]===
Reisen is Tewi's fellow youkai rabbit serving under Eirin, like Tewi. Unlike the earth rabbits, Reisen acts as Tewi's superior, ordering Tewi around and being in charge of looking after her. It is, however, completely up to Tewi herself whether she listens to Reisen or not. Around Eientei, Reisen also tends to be the unfortunate primary recipient of Tewi's pranks.

===Gensokyo's youkai [[rabbit]]s===
All of Gensokyo's youkai rabbits (from Earth, not the Moon) obey Tewi. This is either a sign or a result of Tewi's enlightenment and power. Tewi knows every single youkai rabbit currently in Gensokyo, although this does not stem from the psychic connection that rabbits have. If a new youkai rabbit hypothetically came into being, Tewi would not automatically know about it, although youkai birth rates are so low that Tewi would probably find out very fast.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cage in Lunatic Runagate]]: [[Cage in Lunatic Runagate/First Chapter|First Chapter]] — "There aren't any youkai rabbits that Tewi doesn't know." "Would it be so strange to think that one youkai rabbit nobody knows could show up?" "That cannot possibly be true. It's much harder for a new youkai to be born than it is for a human." "It's true that Tewi knows all the youkai rabbits. If Tewi says none of them were hurt, the youkai rabbit at the shrine must be a fake."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:InabaoftheMoonandInabaoftheEarthTewiPillagingMode.png|thumb|120px|right|Tewi's pillaging mode in Chapter 22 of ''[[IoM&amp;IoE]]'']]
*It is said that ordinary animals who live a long time may develop profound magical abilities. Tewi is one of them.
*She seems to be something of a prankster, as shown in ''[[Eastern and Little Nature Deity]]'' and even ''[[Inaba of the Moon and Inaba of the Earth]]''. 
*In ''[[Oriental Sacred Place]]'' chapter 12, Tewi is shown with sunglasses and holding a cigarette while selling colored rabbits during a [[Hakurei Shrine]] festival. This is a call out reference to chapter 22 of ''Inaba of the Moon and Inaba of the Earth'',  where she is seen carrying a machine gun and wearing sunglasses and a mask. ''Inaba of the Moon and Inaba of the Earth'' also shows that those colored rabbits were a scam (they're just painted).
*She is shown to be fond of beer in the stage backgrounds of ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'', which may be a call out reference to ''Inaba of the Moon and Inaba of the Earth''.
*Tewi is the only original [[Boss|midboss]] character to become a fully playable character.

'''Stage 5 Midboss, Rabbit of the Earth'''&lt;br /&gt;
'''Tewi Inaba'''

Species: [[Youkai]] [[Rabbit]]&lt;br /&gt;
Abilities: Conferring good luck to humans

After taking good care of her health and living for a long time, Tewi has the power equivalent to that of a youkai. She leads the Earthborn rabbits living in [[Eientei]]. Her impetuous temperament makes her seem more like a fairy than a youkai.

[[Human]]s who lose their way in the bamboo forest around Eientei sometimes catch a glimpse of Tewi. Those who see her are able to find their way out without fail, so she is considered a guide of the forest.

It's a shame that they waste the fortune given to them by Tewi on such a small thing, but humans are too clueless to notice their mistake.

The {{nihongo|'''Three Fairies of Light'''|光の三妖精|Hikari no San-Yousei}}, or the {{nihongo|'''Three Fairies'''|三妖精|San-Yousei}} for short, also called the '''Three Mischievous Fairies''', are a small group of [[fairy|fairies]] composed of [[Sunny Milk]], [[Luna Child]], and [[Star Sapphire]]. They are known for causing mischief to [[human]]s by playing pranks on them using their powers. They are the protagonists of the ''[[Touhou Sangetsusei]]'' manga series, and the antagonists of ''[[Fairy Wars]]''.

==Background Information==
[[File:FS Three Fairies of Light.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The Three Fairies of Light in ''[[Forbidden Scrollery]]'']]
===Name===
The "three lights" refer to the sun, moon, and stars, the most clearly visible lights in the sky. It is from these lights that the fairies derive their power and after which they have been named. Many of their [[spell card]]s reflect how they derive their power. These three lights are also referred to in the name of work in which they appeared; The title of the manga, {{nihongo|"Sangetsusei"|三月精}} is a wordplay, which loosely means "sun, moon, stars" respectively based on pronunciation, whereas "三精/Sansei/Three Sprites" used to be the old name for these three heavenly bodies put together. {{nihongo||三|san}} can also mean {{nihongo||サン|san|Katakana transliteration of English "sun"}}, {{nihongo||月|getsu|"moon"}} stays the same and {{nihongo||精|sei|"fairy"}} shares the same sound as {{nihongo||星|sei|"star"}}.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Eastern and Little Nature Deity]]'': [[Shanghai Alice Correspondence Three Fairies Version/Volume 5|Shanghai Alice Correspondence Three Fairies Version - Volume 5]]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''{{H:title|Tokiko|This name is unofficial.}}'''|朱鷺子}} is a minor, unnamed character who only appears in ''[[Curiosities of Lotus Asia]]''. She is probably just one of the many weak [[youkai]] in [[Gensokyo]], but seems to value and enjoy books. 
==General Information==

Tokiko, a technically unnamed character, appears in the first chapter of ''[[Curiosities of Lotus Asia]]'', where she is beaten up by [[Reimu Hakurei]] while trying to read a book. It is presumed that she is a youkai because of the fact that she has wings, but other than that, nothing is known about her.

==Character Design==
===Name===
Her true name is unknown, but {{nihongo|''Tokiko''|朱鷺子}} is a popular name for her among the fanbase. {{nihongo|''toki''|朱鷺}} means "crested ibis", a bird which she resembles in appearance and {{nihongo|''ko''|子}} means "child" and is a general-purpose kanji for girls' names. Also, she was referred to on the Japanese [[wikipedia:Wikipedia|Wikipedia]] on the [[wikipedia:ja:東方香霖堂 〜 Curiosities of Lotus Asia.#その他の登場人物|Curiosities of Lotus Asia]] article as the {{nihongo|"Unnamed Book-Reading [[Youkai]]"|名無し本読み妖怪|Nanashi hon yomi yōkai}} and later as {{nihongo|"The Youkai Who Read a Book"|本を読んでいた妖怪|Hon wo yonde ita yōkai}}. "Unnamed Book-Reading Youkai" is, however, still a popular name to refer to her.

===Design===
In ''[[Curiosities of Lotus Asia]]'', Tokiko has white hair that is partly blue, red eyes, and wears a black dress with blue trim. She also appears to have wings on her back, small horns on her head, and what appears to be a single wing on the rear of her head, possibly meant to represent the ibis' crest on the back of its head.

==Story==
;''Curiosities of Lotus Asia''
:{{Main|Curiosities of Lotus Asia/Chapter 01|l1=Curiosities of Lotus Asia Chapter 1}}
In ''[[Curiosities of Lotus Asia]]'', Tokiko was beaten and robbed by [[Reimu Hakurei]], who then sold the books she stole to [[Rinnosuke Morichika]]. After showing up at [[Kourindou]] to reclaim her books, she was presumably beaten up once again, this time by [[Marisa Kirisame]].

;''Forbidden Scrollery''
She is seen flying with Lily White in the first page of Fobidden Scrollery's chapter 6.

==Relationships==
;[[Reimu Hakurei]] (Exterminator)
;[[Marisa Kirisame]] (Exterminator)
;[[Lily White]] (Unknown)
Tokiko is seen in a single panel in ''[[Forbidden Scrollery]]'', next to Lily White at the coming of spring.

==Additional Information==
===Trivia===
*While shown as a weak [[youkai]], after retaliating and causing damage to [[Reimu Hakurei]] when the [[shrine maiden]] originally thought the fight would be an easy one, she at least proved more formidable than Reimu first thought.
*After beating up Tokiko outside [[Kourindou]], Marisa brings a crested ibis into the store, which she cooks and eats with Reimu. Tokiko's resemblance to a crested ibis may or may not be coincidental.

{{nihongo|'''Toyosatomimi no Miko'''|豊聡耳　神子}} is the main antagonist of [[Ten Desires]]. She's a [[saint]] who spread [[Buddhism]] across the country as ruler while [[Seiga Kaku]] taught her [[Taoism]]. As a follower of Taoism training to attain immortality, she now lives her life in a simple, carefree manner as a [[hermit]].

==General Information==
Miko was the Final [[boss]] of ''[[Ten Desires]]'', is a playable character in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'', was a Final day boss in ''[[Impossible Spell Card]]'' and later a playable character in ''[[Urban Legend in Limbo]]''.

Although she is a [[hermit]] (shikaisen) just like [[Mononobe no Futo]], the fact that she was specially designated as "[[saint]]" may be due to the difference that Futo never having stopped being an ordinary [[human]].

===Personality===
Miko is characterized as being "surprisingly casual", and frequently jokes around. Though she's a fully immortal [[hermit]], she still tends to get involved in secular affairs because of her origins as a ruler. During combat, however, she displays no sign of weakness and seems to completely see through her opponents. As a hermit, she isn't concerned about teaching her techniques to the many that want to become her disciples, and simply uses them as servants and couriers. She's cooperative and friendly towards [[human]]s in general, though. Due to her ability however, she may not listen to people's conversation.

In ''Symposium of Post-Mysticism'', Miko expressed interest in acting as an "administrator" for the [[Human Village]] to prevent collapse of its society, but stepped back when she was told that it was not necessary.

In speech, first person, she uses the word {{nihongo|"watashi"|私||"I"}} in first person and {{nihongo|"kimi"|君||"you"}} in second. It also seems like she uses {{nihongo|"anata"|貴方|"you"}} for those who acknowledge her true power. Since she's a [[saint]], it would be appropriate for her to be polite in general. She apologised for being impolite to [[Reimu Hakurei]] when fighting her and invited Reimu to her home in [[Senkai]].

===Abilities===
In her profile in ''[[Ten Desires]]'' and in ''[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]]'', it's mentioned that Miko has performed many superhuman feats. The ones listed here are the specific ones [[ZUN]] describes.

;Listening to ten people's conversations at the same time
As literally stated,  [[wikipedia:Prince Shōtoku|Prince Shoutoku]] – according to legend – was so smart that he could understand ten people questioning him at once, and reply to each of them with perfect answers. This is pointed out by her name, "Toyosatomimi". Because of this ability Miko's ears are extremely sensitive, leading her to wear earmuffs.

Miko, who is from a high noble family, has from a young age heard many grumbles from government officials around her. Although one would think that nobody is usually able to understand such government officials, she understood all of it, and was able to give precise instructions to them. The aforementioned thus became a rumour that spread throughout society, and thus she gained tremendous popularity as a saint.

In addition to this ability, which she acquired through the faith she had received as Prince Shoutoku while in her long slumber, gained the ability to hear other people's desires. By listening to the other's "ten desires" simultaneously, she gains insight into the personality, motives, and identities of whose desires she listens to, and thus is able to know everything about the other person; although, originally, such an act wasn't possible before. This power is referenced by the game's title ''[[Ten Desires]]''. However, this ability is not all-powerful, since she has trouble analysing those who inherently lack one or more of the ten desires. In the case of [[Youmu Konpaku]], who – as an irregularity – lacks desire; this is due to being a [[half-phantom]] who lacks desire of neither life nor death, so Miko is unable to completely understand her. She's also unable to read [[Koishi Komeiji]] at all.

On a related note, despite the fact that she has this ability, "she fundamentally does not listen to people's conversations".
It is likely that by hearing the other's desires, it would seem that she would hear others' conversations with the belief that she understands the other already, and that the contents and flow of the conversation has already been self-completed. Thus, on [[stage]] 6 of ''[[Ten Desires]]'', the moment the main character meet with her, by her ability she gained understanding, and without consent or refusal progressed the conversation. She understood Reimu, [[Marisa Kirisame|Marisa]] and [[Sanae Kochiya|Sanae]] as she conceived them, but talked to Youmu based completely on a misunderstanding. Although Youmu tries to point it out and tell about her true nature, she doesn't listen at all and simply talked more as she wished.

;Abilities as a [[shikaisen]]
Miko is trained in [[Taoism|Taoist]] magic, seeming to favor spells themed around light and swords. She has displayed a number of abilities typically associated with hermits, including [[wikipedia:shukuchi|shukuchi]] movement (with the aid of a cape)&lt;ref&gt;''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'': [[Hopeless Masquerade/Spell Cards/Toyosatomimi no Miko#Skill 1|Shukuchi Cape]] skill card&lt;/ref&gt;. 
During Reisen's scenario in [[Urban Legend in Limbo]], she was also able to break [[Kaguya Houraisan]]'s spell that made the corridor inside [[Eientei]] endless. According to Miko, since Kaguya's spell connected minuscule gaps in space-time, she neutralized it by using a hermit art that absorbs space.

;Attracting desires
Miko has displayed the ability to attract and absorb desires from her surroundings (usually in the form of [[divine spirit|vulgar spirits]]) to increase her power. In ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'' this takes the form of a secondary popularity meter, increasing or reducing her stats depending on the crowd's opinion of her. It is unclear whether this ability is related to her status as a [[saint]] and/or [[god]], or simply an extension of her ability to hear desires.

===Occupation===
Miko's a hermit living in [[Senkai]]. Though she apparently has disciples, she doesn't teach them her ways, but rather treats them as servants. Her main goal is to achieve immortality, and then eventually become a [[celestial]]. She has shown interest in becoming a leader to human society as seen in [[Symposium of Post-mysticism]], coincidentally the surge of a leader in the Human Village is seen as the biggest threat to balance in Gensokyo for youkai society as mentioned by Aya in [[Forbidden Scrollery]] and possibly reffering to Miko.

===Possessions===
The sword that Miko holds is assumed to be {{nihongo|Shichi-sei ken|七星剣}} lit. Seven-Star Sword, a Chinese-made sword originally owned by her namesake which was influenced by [[Taoism]]. It's one of two swords Prince Shotoku was most famous for.

Her primary weapon is a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaku_(ritual_baton) shaku], which is also commonly associated with Prince Shoutoku.

==Backstory==
[[File:ThGKMiko.png|thumb|right|200px|Toyosatomimi no Miko, as illustrated in ''[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]]'']]
Toyosatomimi no Miko is the true identity of Prince Shoutoku, a politician and advocate of Buddhism in the sixth century. According to her profile, she was born in a stable, and was revered as a genius from a very young age, able to offer advice to people much older than her. She was all out in displaying her talents and abilities, but because of her genius, she was dissatisfied. She considered: "the earth hasn't changed from the age of the gods, and the seas are still filled to the brim. Why must humans be forced to accept death?" Upon this consideration however, she eventually turned against her natural fate as a human – to eventually die.

She was then approached by [[Seiga Kaku]], a [[hermit]] who heard of the rumour of Miko and taught her the ways of [[Taoism]]. She was delighted at hearing that it was a religion that was a realisation of true [[immortal|immortality]], but she also conveyed to Seiga that Taoism wasn't a religion suited for ruling a country.

They then hatched a plan: because Taoism isn't sufficient for calming the problems of an entire people, she took on the appearance of advocating for [[Buddhism]] instead, which preached peace. Seiga proposed the remedy that she would have the outwards appearance of having faith in Buddhism, a religion that has strict rules against the killing of any kind of life. Accepting the condition that in this way, the country would be stable.

As time passed, she progressed in her study of Taoism. As other people of political influence put faith in Buddhism, in accordance with her own instruction in Taoism, she demonstrated superhuman abilities and pulled off feats so unreal to the extent that in future generations, fictitious tales related to her became well-known. The legends that she left for future generations had this kind of behind-the-scenes to it.

Miko was not negligent of her final objective of achieving true immortality, but in the process, the cinnabar (mercury sulfide, a poisonous substance) that was supposed to bring about immortality, instead ruined her body. She made the judgment that she would not be able to hold onto her body like this and decided to become a [[shikaisen]]. However, Miko was afraid of implementing this all by herself. To test it, she asked [[Mononobe no Futo]] – though they were enemies on the surface – and Tojiko be revived. Therefore, she relied on having Futo going to sleep first.

After Futo continued to sleep without decaying, Miko performed the ritual on herself. Her plan was to reawaken once the nation had outgrown Buddhism, they awaited their revival in the time of seeking sainthood. Unfortunately for her, Buddhism dominated the Japanese people for over a thousand years. In actuality, since Buddhist monks repeatedly sealed Miko's mausoleum with the power of Buddhism, she was unable to revive. Her plan was foiled.

Since there was no need to be in a hurry, she continued to wait until the time of her resurrection. People in general started disbelieving in the feats Miko had performed. Currently, there are definitely no illusion-like powers like humans who display superhuman abilities, so it was inevitable that her exploits were suspected to be fictitious.

However, due to this denial of illusion, she and the mausoleum moved to [[Gensokyo]]. When Miko finally was about to be resurrected, it was after the entire mausoleum had been transported to [[Gensokyo]]. There were no temples, so it was always possible for her to prepare for the revival. However, just then, [[Myouren Temple|a Buddhist temple]] had been built on top of the mausoleum to prevent her resurrection, both due to bad timing and because [[Byakuren Hijiri|the temple's head priest]] had concluded that powerful human rulers like her would be dangerous for the youkai&lt;ref&gt;[[Strange Creators of Outer World/Who's Who of Humans &amp; Youkai in Gensokyo|Strange Creators of Outer World (Who's Who of Humans &amp; Youkai in Gensokyo)]] - [[Strange Creators of Outer World/Who's Who of Humans &amp; Youkai in Gensokyo/Toyosatomimi no Miko|Toyosatomimi no Miko]]&lt;/ref&gt;. Fortunately, the act did more to revive her than otherwise; the mausoleum was finally broken, and the [[divine spirit]]s that were attracted to Miko overflowed throughout Gensokyo.

==Character Design==
[[File:WaHHMiko.png|thumb|right|150px|Miko's appearance in ''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'']]
===Origin===
Toyosatomimi no Miko is the incarnation of the fictitious tales of {{nihongo|[[wikipedia:Prince Shotoku|Prince Shotoku]]|聖徳太子|Shoutoku Taishi|lit. "Prince Virtue"}}, real name {{nihongo|Prince Umayado|厩戸皇子}}, who was a legendary regent and political figure of the [[wikipedia:Asuka period|Asuka period]], living from 574/02/07–622/05/08. He was purportedly born in front of a horse stable, being named Umayado, lit. "Prince of the Stable Door" as a result. He was crucial in the spread of Buddhism in Japan and according to folklore, could comprehend ten simultaneous conversations, like his ''[[Touhou Project]]'' namesake. Because of this, he was also named {{nihongo|''Toyosatomimi''|豊聡耳|lit. "abundant, clever ears"}} at very first, which would be soon pronounced as ''Toyotomimi'' for the same kanji. He eventually came to be recognized for his contributions and was seen as something like a [[saint]], but some accounts of his life have also been subject to criticism and debate.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.onmarkproductions.com/html/hata-lost-identity-shotoku-con.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Name===
Her full name is {{nihongo|Toyosatomimi no Miko|豊聡耳神子}}. Her name is derived primarily from two names given for Prince Shotoku given in the Nihon Shoki, {{nihongo|Umayato-no-toyotomimi-no-miko|厩戸豊聡耳皇子}} and  {{nihongo|Umayato-no-toyotomimi-no-mikoto|厩戸豊聡耳命}}. The suffix of the first name, {{nihongo|"miko"|皇子、皇女}}, was a title used for children of nobility in the [[wikipedia :Yamato_period#Yamato_state|Yamato court]]; the second,  {{nihongo|"mikoto"|尊、命}} is a suffix attached to the names of gods and some nobility. This may be why the first character in her first name is {{nihongo||神}}, meaning "god". It may also derive from {{nihongo|''shinsen''|神仙}}, a term for [[hermit|Taoist immortals]], or from {{nihongo|''shinrei''|神霊}}, the [[divine spirit|divine spirits]] that appear in [[Ten Desires]]. The meaning of "toyotomimi", which can also be read as "toyosatomimi", is described in the previous section.

She is called {{nihongo|"Taishi-sama"|太子様}} by her followers, from Shoutoku's most well-known title. Though usually translated as "Crown Prince," {{nihongo|''taishi''|太子}} only denotes an heir apparent to a throne, not specifically a male heir. (Perhaps coincidentally, the only woman historically to use the title was [[wikipedia :Empress Kōken|Empress Kouken]], who was known as Empress Shoutoku during her second reign.)

===Design===
In ''[[Ten Desires]]'''s official art, Miko has very light, almost platinum blonde hair, styled like horns or ears, as well as grey eyes. She wears purple headgear which has been described as both headphones&lt;ref&gt;[[Ten Desires special and two-part interview with ZUN]]&lt;/ref&gt; and earmuffs&lt;ref&gt;[[Symposium of Post-mysticism/Toyosatomimi no Miko|Symposium of Post-mysticism: Toyosatomimi no Miko]]&lt;/ref&gt;. They bear the Chinese character meaning {{Nihongo|"Harmony"|和|wa}} which was used as the name of ancient Japan ([[wikipedia:Wa (Japan)|Wa]]). Her clothes are a purple dress under a white vest with elaborate trimming. The colors used in her dress refers to the [[wikipedia:Twelve Level Cap and Rank System|Twelve level cap and rank system]]: a famous political achievement that she (= [[wikipedia :Prince Shōtoku|Prince Shoutoku]]) made (&lt;span style="color:#800080;"&gt;"violet" [Greater Virtue]&lt;/span&gt; represents 1st rank and &lt;span style="color:#cc99ff;"&gt;"purple" [Lesser Virtue]&lt;/span&gt; for 2nd rank.). She holds a [[wikipedia:Shaku (ritual_baton)|shaku]] and carries a sword which is assumed to be the {{nihongo|[[wikipedia:ja:七星剣|Seven Star Sword]]|七星剣|Shichi-sei ken}} - a Taoism sword known to be worn by Prince Shoutoku in [[wikipedia:File:Prince Shotoku.jpg|this portrait]] - on her waist.

In Sanae's ending of ''[[Ten Desires]]'', it's shown that Prince Shotoku is historically seen as a bearded man, as his face is on old yen bills. Sanae is unable to figure out the reason for this discrepancy, although the fact that she was using an elementary school history textbook to research it probably didn't help.

In ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'''s official art, she additionally wears a large, collared cape. It is colored light purple and bright red respectively on the outer and the back side. And a yellow line is drawn along with the end of the outer surface. Already mentioned above, purple is an elegant, authentic color only permitted for nobles on the absolutely high ranks. Yellow is also a noble color; it is originally the symbol of the Emperor in Ancient Chinese tradition, which was adopted into the aristocrat system during the age of Prince Shoutoku.

In [[Symposium of Post-mysticism]], she is described to have sharp ears, which is under her headphones.

===Games===
;''Ten Desires''
[[File:Th13MikoSprite.png|frame|Miko's sprite in ''TD'']]
Miko is the final [[boss]] of ''[[Ten Desires]]'', appearing to the main character once they have made their way into the [[Hall of Dreams' Great Mausoleum]]. The heroines all appear to fight her for no reason, but Miko welcomes the battle to aid in her resurrection. During the fight, she calls on [[Mononobe no Futo]] and [[Soga no Tojiko]] to assist her.
:{{Main|Ten Desires/Story/Reimu's Scenario#Stage 6|l1=Reimu Arc}}
Miko has looked into Reimu's past and determined that she is an enemy, because she is a "friend" to the monks who would keep her sealed away. They end up battling for no real reason. In Reimu's normal ending, she appears to the shrine maiden and Marisa by coming out of the ground; she apologizes to them and invites them to visit her whenever they wish. They then go back to the Mausoleum and Reimu is impressed.
:{{Main|Ten Desires/Story/Marisa's Scenario#Stage 6|l1=Marisa Arc}}
Marisa realizes that Miko is the one who has gathered all of the [[divine spirit]]s here. Miko tells Marisa that she could never control her own desires, and the two start fighting.
:{{Main|Ten Desires/Story/Sanae's Scenario#Stage 6|l1=Sanae Arc}}
As Sanae wonders about the name Mononobe, which she thinks she's heard before, Miko explains that the Mononobe clan was her enemy. She introduces herself as Prince Shoutoku, and invites Sanae to do battle with her.
:{{Main|Ten Desires/Story/Youmu's Scenario#Stage 6|l1=Youmu Arc}}
When Miko meets Youmu, she observes that she lacks two of the "ten desires" – attachment to life, and envy of death. Miko mistakes her as a [[hermit]] because of it, and asks for a battle so that the two of them may be revived.
===Spin-offs===
;Hopeless Masquerade
:{{Main|Hopeless Masquerade/Story/Miko's Scenario|l1=Miko Arc}}
Miko is one of the main religious proponents in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'', along with [[Reimu Hakurei]] and [[Byakuren Hijiri]]; she represents [[Taoism]]. She appears in the other characters' routes often as a main opponent. In her own storyline, after easily defeating Reimu, Marisa, and [[Ichirin Kumoi]], she faces off against Byakuren. After telling her what a sham [[Buddhism]] is, Miko defeats her, finally earning the hearts of the people, which she promises to return. However, before she returns hope to the people, a doppelganger appears and summons a fake crowd. After Miko beats her, she is revealed to be [[Mamizou Futatsuiwa]].

At this point, after the violent fight, Miko has lost all her faith, but after she defeats her again, Mamizou explains that someone has been draining the emotions from the [[Human Village]] at night. Miko goes there and meets [[Hata no Kokoro]], the culprit. Miko recognizes her masks as those belonging to Hata no Kawakatsu, and speculates that they had become [[tsukumogami]]. These masks coalesced to form the [[youkai]], Kokoro. Miko offers to create a new [[Mask of Hope]] for her to solve the incident, as she was the one that made her masks in the first place. After the events, Miko talks to Reimu about the masks and the manipulation of emotions that occurred. Miko has made a new mask in her own likeness for Kokoro, partly to get ahead in the religious conflict. With it, the incident should be resolved.

;''Impossible Spell Card''
:{{Main|Impossible Spell Card#Story|l1=Impossible Spell Card: Story}}
After apparently reading the newspaper by the [[tengu]] about a mischief-making [[amanojaku]], she becomes one of the many strong [[youkai]] and [[human]]s to try and stop [[Seija Kijin]] in the final day. She uses [[spell card]]s that are considered impossible to dodge.

;''Urban Legend in Limbo''
{{stub|section}}
Miko investigates the new Occult Balls which guarantee urban legends, and fights everyone who has one, knowing that's the only way to get them. Thanks to her investigation, she discovers that she needs to collect them or the other ones will spread around, and the incident won't never be solved. After recovering seven, her mausoleum starts to gain more visitors. However, those visitors were humans asking her about about the spread rumors about the balls. Later, she realizes that one of her balls had a different aura. An aura from the [[Lunar Capital]].

;''Antinomy of Common Flowers''
In ''[[Antinomy of Common Flowers]]'', Miko teams up with [[Byakuren Hijiri]] to investigate and resolve the Perfect Posession incident. They also receive assistance from [[Ichirin Kumoi]] and [[Mononobe no Futo]].

Miko, the owner of the [[Concert Stage of the Sun]], was to give a speech before the [[Prismriver]]s' concert. There, she encounters [[Yukari Yakumo]], who claims she is also resolving the Perfect Posession incident. Miko is hesitant to share the results of her investigation, but Byakuren trusts Yukari and shares what she learned about forced Perfect Posession. In return, Yukari tells the superhuman duo that the mastermind behind Perfect Posession will appear when the concert begins.

The duo then encounters [[Joon Yorigami|Joon]] and [[Shion Yorigami]]. Joon uses her spell to exchange Shion and Byakuren, and Miko is forced to fight with the poverty god at her side, destined to lose.

===Literature===
;''Wild and Horned Hermit, chapter 18''
During the pessimistic attitude gripping the [[Human Village]] during the events of ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'', Miko receives a visit from [[Kasen Ibara]]. Miko bows to her, surprising everyone present. She tells Kasen that though she never actively sought out disciples, they came to her anyway because they idealize the concept of a [[hermit]]. Kasen asks her why she became a hermit in the first place, and Miko simply answers that she wanted to overcome her own humanity. She repeats Reimu's own thoughts about needing to provide religious service for those who have lost hope. As Miko sees her off, she mentions that she can feel a great power, far more than her own, coming from Kasen. Kasen insists she doesn't have disciples; just some animals. This greatly impresses Miko, who considers having animals as disciples is on another level from having humans as disciples. As they part, Kasen insists that she became a hermit to become closer to people, which surprises Miko.

==Relationships==
===Taoist Allies===
Miko has a few followers as part of her religion. [[Mononobe no Futo]] is an ally of Toyosatomimi no Miko. Futo acted as Miko's test subject during the process of immortality.  [[Soga no Tojiko]] is an ally of Toyosatomimi no Miko. These two assists Miko during one of her spell cards.

[[Seiga Kaku]] is an ally of Toyosatomimi no Miko. Seiga was the one who taught Miko the charms of Taoism. Despite this, she feels Seiga would cause trouble down the line. [[Yoshika Miyako]] is a [[Jiang Shi]] controlled by Seiga who guarded Toyosatomimi no Miko's mausoleum during her resurrection; as of yet any interaction between the two have not been seen, whether in the past or present.

===People from the Myouren Temple=== 
The residence of the [[Myouren Temple]] is an enemy of Toyosatomimi no Miko and her allies. The existence of a Buddhist faction lead to the resurrection of the [[Hall of Dreams' Great Mausoleum]]. The Buddhist [[monk]] [[Byakuren Hijiri]]'s Myouren Temple was built above Miko's mausoleum; obstructing her resurrection. [[Nue Houjuu]], a resident of the temple, called in [[Mamizou Futatsuiwa]] in order to fight against Miko.

===Minor Relationships===
;Reimu Hakurei
Toyosatomimi no Miko has watched [[Reimu Hakurei]] from before she was born and mentions that there are things she can learn from her. &lt;ref&gt; Reimu's Scenario, ''[[Ten Desires/Story/Reimu's Scenario#Stage_6|Ten Desires]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

;Hata no Kokoro
During the events of ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'', Miko recognises [[Hata no Kokoro]] as the [[Tsukumogami]] [[Youkai]] of the 66 masks that Miko made for Hata no Kawakatsu, the legendary creator of Sarugaku (a form of Japanese theatre), before she was sealed. She subsequently promises to remake the lost mask of hope that originally caused Kokoro to go berserk, which is in the ending revealed to be a mask of Miko's own face.

==Additional Information==
*The butterfly that Miko uses in some attacks probably alludes to the story of [[wikipedia:Zhuangzi#The butterfly dream|Zhuangzi's butterfly dream]], one of the most well-known Taoist philosophy stories.
*Miko's left hand appears to have been drawn incorrectly on her ''[[Ten Desires]]'' portrait. Her fingers should be showing while her thumb should be hidden. Basically, it looks like she has two right hands. However, if you consider that the left hand's finger which the viewer sees is a pinky, everything looks normal.
*With seven [[spell card]]s, Miko is the first final [[boss]] since the spell card system was introduced not to have either five or six spell cards (not including [[Kaguya Houraisan]]'s last spells.)
*Miko is the first and only game character whose precise age and birth date is known.
*In Miko's spell cards, the background features the [[wikipedia:Hōryū-ji#Pagoda|Five-storied Pagoda of Hōryū-ji]]. Hōryū-ji is a Buddhist temple commissioned by Prince Shotoku.
*The group of men next to her spirit bar in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'' is a direct reference to the "Gaijin 4koma", better known as the "Reaction Guys" meme in the western world (particularly their excited state).
*Miko shares a spell background texture with [[Okina Matara]].

　　豊聡耳 神子（とよさとみみのみこ）&lt;br/&gt;
　　Toyosatomimi no Miko

　　種族：聖人&lt;br/&gt;
　　能力：十人の話を同時に聞く事が出来る程度の能力


　　馬小屋で生まれ、幼い頃から才覚を認められた天才であった。

　　やんごとなき生まれの彼女は、幼い頃から様々な訴えを聞く事があった。&lt;br/&gt;
　　どうせ理解できないだろうと思って、役人達の愚痴のようなものを投げかけられることも多かった。&lt;br/&gt;
　　しかし、神子はその全てを理解し、すぐに的確な指示を出すことが出来た。&lt;br/&gt;
　　その噂が世間に広まり、聖人として絶大な人気を得たようである。

　　彼女には天才ならではの葛藤があった。&lt;br/&gt;
　　「大地は神々の時代から変わらず、海は水を湛えている。&lt;br/&gt;
　　　何故、人間は死を受け入れなければならないのか」&lt;br/&gt;
　　次第に、彼女は死んでいく人間の運命に不満を持つようになった。



　　神子の評判を聞きつけた青娥は、この人ならば間違い無いと思い、道教を勧めにやってくる。

　　道教は自然崇拝であり、自然と一体になることで不老不死を実現することが出来る、そういう内容であった。

　　神子は心躍らされた。&lt;br/&gt;
　　それと同時に、その宗教ではいつまで経っても国が平定しない、と青娥に伝えた。&lt;br/&gt;
　　青娥は自分の願いを実現するためには国の政治などどうでも良いと思っていたが、神子はそうは考えなかったのだ。

　　青娥はならばこうしましょう、と言って、表向きは仏教を信仰する話を持ちかけた。仏教は殺生を禁じ、規律の厳しい宗教であると伝えると、神子はそれならば国は落ち着くであろう、と納得した。



　　神子は仏教を広めた。これは権力者以外が力を持たないようにする為である。その裏で、道教の研究を進めた。

　　その結果、超人的な能力を発揮し、様々な伝説を残したのは皆が知る事である。


　　そして、最終目的である不老不死の研究も怠らなかった。&lt;br/&gt;
　　丹砂など様々な稀少な鉱物を使う事もあった。それが彼女の体を蝕んだ。&lt;br/&gt;
　　本来不老長寿をもたらす筈の道術で体を壊してしまったのである。

　　神子は今の体のままでは持たないと思い、尸解仙になることを決意した。&lt;br/&gt;
　　尸解仙は一度死んで（もしくは死んだように見せかけて）、再び復活する秘術である。

　　しかし自分一人で実行するのを怖れた神子は、布都に話を持ちかけ、まず先に眠りについて貰うように話した。&lt;br/&gt;
　　布都は神子の力を信じ、実験台となったのである。死後、腐りもせずに眠り続けた布都を確認すると、自らも眠りについたのであった。



　　神子の計画では、国が仏教に限界を感じ聖人を求めた時に復活する予定であった。しかしその思惑ははずれ、仏教は千年以上もこの国を支配する。

　　仏教の力ある僧侶達は神子の霊廟を封じ続けた為、復活することが出来なかったのである。神子の企みは筒抜けであったのだ。

　　焦ることはない、いつ復活しても良いと眠り続けた神子であった。そして復活の時がようやく来たのである。

　　その理由は、彼女の伝説が全て作り物であると言われ始めた事による。&lt;br/&gt;
　　今現在では超人的な能力を持つ人間が居なくなってしまい、彼女の偉業は全て虚構だと思われても仕方ないことであろう。

　　それにより彼女は霊廟ごと幻想郷に移動した。その時、幻想郷にはお寺が存在しなかったため、いつでも復活出来る準備が整ったのだ。

　　しかし、そのタイミングで新しいお寺が出来てしまう。&lt;br/&gt;
　　しかも狙ったかのように霊廟の真上にである。

　　それが命蓮寺だった。

　　神子は再び仏教の僧侶によって押さえつけられてしまうのか。&lt;br/&gt;
　　それとも僧侶と戦うのだろうか。

　　その昔、物部（古の神々）と蘇我（仏教）が死闘を繰り広げたように。

&lt;br/&gt;
Toyosatomimi no Miko

Species: Saint&lt;br/&gt;
Ability: Capable of listening to ten people's conversations at the same time.


Born in a stable, she was recognized as a genius at an early age.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Born into a high position, she overheard many complaints when she was young.&lt;br/&gt;
People would let their tongues loose around her, assuming she wouldn't be able to understand them, so she heard a lot of idle grumbling from servants and such.&lt;br/&gt;
However, Miko was able to understand them - and provide very specific advice right away.&lt;br/&gt;
Rumors of her spread throughout the land, and she gained enormous popularity as a saint.

She had her own troubles as a genius.&lt;br/&gt;
"The earth hasn't changed from the age of the gods, and the seas are still filled to the brim.&lt;br/&gt;
Why must humans be forced to accept death?"&lt;br/&gt;
She became dissatisfied with her fate that, as a human, she would eventually die.



Seiga, who had heard the rumours about Miko, was confident she'd found the person she'd been looking for, and came to spread Taoism to her.

Taoism was essentially nature worship, and by becoming one with nature it could bestow immortality on its followers.

Miko's heart danced in joy.&lt;br/&gt;
She also told Seiga that her faith could never lead to having strong rule over a country.&lt;br/&gt;
Seiga didn't care about national politics so long as she could further her own goals, but Miko held a different view.

In that case, Seiga recommended, she should make the appearance of becoming a Buddhist. When Miko learned Buddhism was a strict creed that forbade murder, she determined it would be a good means to calm the nation, and accepted it.


Miko spread Buddhism throughout the country, in order to ensure that those without political power would not gain power. In the shadows, she advanced her own experiments with Taoism.

As a result, she obtained superhuman abilities and left behind a number of legends with which everyone is familiar.


She didn't neglect her work towards her ultimate goal of immortality.&lt;br/&gt;
She turned to the use of various unusual materials, such as cinnabar.
This ruined her body.&lt;br/&gt;
She had destroyed her health because of the very Taoism that was meant to grant her immortality.

Thinking she'd be unable to wait long enough with the state her body was in, Miko decided to become a shikaisen.
This was a secret technique in which she would die (or make it appear that she'd died) and be resurrected.

However, afraid to undergo the procedure alone, she reached out to Futo, and convinced her to go to sleep first.&lt;br/&gt;
Believing in Miko's power, Futo became her test subject. Once Miko confirmed that, after death, Futo continued to sleep without decaying, Miko went to sleep herself.



Miko had planned to awaken when the nation felt limited by its Buddhist precepts and felt the need for a saint. However, her
calculations went awry, and the nation was controlled by Buddhism for over a thousand years.

Because Buddhist monks continued to place seals on Miko's mausoleum, she was unable to resurrect. Miko's plan had been foiled.

Miko judged she had no need to rush and could resurrect herself at any time, and so continued sleeping. Finally, the time of her resurrection came.

The trigger was a rumor that the legends regarding her were all fabricated. Since, in modern times, there were no more people
with superhuman powers, it wasn't surprising that tales of her exploits were seen as simple lies.

As a result, her mausoleum ended up in Gensokyo. Since there weren't any temples in Gensokyo at that time, she prepared for her resurrection to proceed whenever she felt it was necessary.

By some stoke of timing, though, a new temple was built.&lt;br/&gt;
And, whether by plan or by chance, it was built directly over her mausoleum.

That was, of course, Myouren Temple.

Would Miko let herself be held back by a Buddhist monk once more?&lt;br/&gt;
Or would she fight that monk?

A fight just like the battles between the Mononobe clan (of the old gods) and
the Soga clan (of the Buddhists) had fought over and over so long ago?

'''Almighty Taoist who Controls the Cosmos, Toyosatomimi no Miko'''

Hope has vanished from the hearts of humans.&lt;br /&gt;
Miko, who noticed that this was happening, sought to save the world by becoming their hope herself.&lt;br /&gt;
In order to do that, first, she'd have to defeat those bothersome individuals in her own trade,&lt;br /&gt;
and then seize the hearts of humans for herself.&lt;br /&gt;
Miko sought out Gensokyo's most ancient religion.&lt;br /&gt;

'''Special skill: Divinely-Appointed Stateswoman'''

Whenever Miko gains popularity, she takes in the audience’s desires.&lt;br /&gt;
When she takes in a lot of these desires, each attack is strengthened.&lt;br /&gt;
Conversely, when her popularity declines, the collected desires are released;&lt;br /&gt;

Placing all of her hermit's power and the popularity gathered from the audience in her shaku,&lt;br /&gt;
she transforms the shaku into a massive sword of light that completely hacks apart the battlefield.&lt;br /&gt;
Although the scope of the attack is confined to around the center of the field,&lt;br/&gt;
her sword of light cannot be grazed nor guarded,&lt;br /&gt;
so if you're within this interval you can take everything down.&lt;br /&gt;

'''Occult Name "Red cape, Blue cape"'''

An all-purpose character that flawlessly combines physical attacks and projectiles; such is the temporary identity with which she sneaks through this world.&lt;br&gt;

When her Occult Attack, “Do you want Red, or Blue?” hits the opponent, it presents the options of red or blue, where red raises attack power and blue raises projectile power. Utilizing this enhanced state and overpowering the opponent is the duty of this character.

The {{nihongo|'''Trump King'''|トランプキング|Toranpu Kingu}} is some kind of creature in the appearance of a card and is the mid[[boss]] of the Extra Stage of ''[[Mystic Square]]''. It appears in a [[Wonderland]] that's possibly a tool created by [[Alice Margatroid]] to use as a weapon and appears out of the blue to attack the heroine after passing some card solders and [[fairy|fairies]]. It sprinkles a barrage of [[danmaku]] at the player and is thought to be strong. Once defeated, it drops a [[1up]]. Since it's got no dialogue with the player, nothing is known about it.

==Character Design ==
===Name===
The card is unnamed, but it is commonly called the {{nihongo|''Trump King''|トランプキング}}, taken from the Japanese fanbase, who notably uses the name to refer to this character. It's possibly written in [[wikipedia:Katakana|katakana]] instead of [[wikipedia:Kanji|kanji]] to give it a western feeling since the whole stage is westernised. It could've easily been written as {{nihongo||切札国王|Kirifuda Kokuou}}. It's call the "king" because it's the strongest card on the stage and that it has a crown, but this is somewhat ambiguously incorrect because a Jack is in the 11th rank below the King and Queen, the lowest face card. It may also be referred to as the {{nihongo|"MS Extra Stage Midboss"|怪綺談EX面中ボス}} or the "Nameless Midboss Card" by Westerners.

===Design===
Its sprite shows that it's a [[wikipedia:playing card|playing card]] that is a Jack due to evidence of a "J", but with an unknown suit. It seems to have red hands, red feet, a red stick and a crown. It appears to be based on the cards seen in ''[[wikipedia:Alice's Adventures in Wonderland|Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'', since the whole stage is also based on this book and the stage theme is called "[[Alice in Wonderland]]".

==Additional Information==
*The Trump King is one of the few midbosses in the whole series that changes its attack pattern of [[danmaku]] as its [[health bar]] decreases.

{{nihongo|'''Tsukasa Kudamaki'''|菅牧　典|Kudamaki Tsukasa}} is the Stage 5, 6, and Extra Stage [[Midboss|midboss]] of ''[[Unconnected Marketeers]]'' as well as being one of the main antagonists.

==General Information==

===Personality===
Tsukasa is a sly [[kuda-gitsune]] who talks out of both sides of her mouth, acting as a "loyal" confidant to her mistress, [[Megumu Iizunamaru]]. Although she presents herself to be Megumu's faithful servant, she seems primarily interested in her own goals. &lt;ref&gt; ''[[Unconnected Marketeers]]'' - Tsuakasa's Profile &lt;/ref&gt; Tsukasa's willingness to manipulate high-class youkai like Megumu, Gods like [[Chimata Tenkyuu]], and even extremely powerful and dangerous youkai like [[Momoyo Himemushi]], demonstrates a high degree of pride and confidence in her skills as a manipulator. She also address them in a very polite manner, calling them "Miss". Despite this, it's shown that Megumu, Chimata, and Momoyo trust her advice, even when they have good reason to be suspicious of her. When challenged, however, she can get quite vicious and mean-spirited, showing her malicious and disparaging side to the protagonist in ''Unconnected Marketeers''. &lt;ref&gt; ''[[Unconnected Marketeers]]'' -  ''"I let you off easy before, since you seemed useful... But if you're going to cause trouble in the tunnels, I've got no more use for you! Die like the pitiful human you are!"'' ([[Unconnected Marketeers/Story/Extra Story|Extra Story]]) &lt;/Ref&gt;

===Abilities===
;Capable of slipping into places where one's soul is weak
Tsukasa senses weak points in the souls of those around her, and can exploit them in order to get what she wants. She demonstrates this ability against Megumu, Chimata, and Momoyo in ''[[Unconnected Marketeers]]''.

;Kuda-gitsune's wealth-bringing
''Kuda-gitsune'' are capable of bringing people great wealth, but can somewhat ironically also cause financial ruin in the long-run.

==Background Information==
===Origin===
{{nihongo|''Kuda-gitsune''|管狐|"pipe fox"}} are mythological beings associated with foxes, weasels, or larval rollers, small enough to fit inside a pipe or bamboo tube. According to tradition, they answer questions to those who conjure them up, or take possession of people. In Touhou, however, the main interpretation shown is that ''kuda-gitsune'' first bring wealth, but over time multiply in such a way that they harm their owners, whether through high financial costs as in traditional mythology, or by stealing their life force as in Touhou Project. For example, in Chapter 8 of [[Wild and Horned Hermit]], [[Reimu Hakurei]] temporarily falls victim to a trick by a kuda-gitsune who steals Reimu's life force.

''Kuda-gitsune'' are also called {{nihongo|''iizuna''|飯綱|'fox spirit'}}. This is the same ''iizuna'' from [[Megumu Iizunamaru|Megumu ''Iizuna''maru]]'s surname.

===Name===
Her given name, {{nihongo|Tsukasa|典}}, typically read {{nihongo|''ten''てん}}, means "law" or "ceremony." Alternate meanings for the kana {{nihongo|''tsukasa''|つかさ}} also include {{nihongo|''chief''|官}} and {{nihongo|''hill''|阜}}, which may be of more significance.

Her surname, {{nihongo|Kudamaki|菅牧}}, means ''[[Wikipedia:Sedge|sedge]] pasture''.

Interestingly, the aforementioned characters {{lang|ja|官}}, {{lang|ja|阜}}, and {{lang|ja|菅}} all share a radical with {{nihongo|''kuda''|管|'pipe'}}, as in {{nihongo|''kuda-gitsune''|管狐}}.

===Design===
Tsukasa has blonde, shoulder-length hair, that partially covers her face and has light-brown to yellow eyes. She has big fox ears with white points and a fluffy foxtail. She wears plain white, one-piece clothing, with green bands at the hemming. On the left thigh is a turquoise flower pattern. Besides that, she wears white socks and holds a test tube in her left hand, which is a reference to her nature as a kuda-gitsune, and is likely the very tube she lives in.

She holds her right hand in a pose shaped like a fox's head.

==Story==
[[File:Th18TsukasaSprite.png|frame|right|Tsukasa's sprite in ''[[Unconnected Marketeers|UM]]'']]
===Games===
;''[[Unconnected Marketeers]]''
From stage 5 onwards, Tsukasa appears in every stage, i.e. 5, 6 and extra, as a mid-boss and in dialogue with the stage boss in order to manipulate them. The protagonist beats her every time, but is drawn into another fight each time by Tsukasa's lies and tricks. As Megumu Iizunamaru's consultant, she was also involved in building the company that triggered the Unconnected Marketeers incident and, despite her seemingly small role in the background, she can be seen as one of the central antagonists.

==Relationships==
;[[Megumu Iizunamaru]]
She is Megumu Iizunamaru's right-hand and seems loyal to her, addressing her in very polite tones. However, Tsukasa is shown to manipulate Megumu all the same. Megumu trusts her without hesitation and seems to appreciate her presence, sending her away before her boss fight, apparently out of concern that Tsukasa might be injured.

;[[Momoyo Himemushi]]
As a messenger for Megumu, Tsukasa brings her messages from Megumu to Momoyo, and vice versa. Tsukasa uses this by announcing that she will report Momoyo's apparent 'failure' to Megumu when the protagonist and [[Misumaru Tamatsukuri]] enter the cave, falsely branding them 'thieves'. Momoyo fights the protagonist, apparently more concerned with having a good fight than upholding any sense of honour with her 'employers'. Momoyo is also able to threaten Tsukasa and blackmail her into silence.&lt;ref&gt; ''[[Unconnected Marketeers]]'' "'' As long as you stay silent about it, I'm guessin' we don't have a problem. Right, Tsukasa?"'' ([[Unconnected Marketeers/Story/Marisa's Scenario|Marisa]]'s Scenario) &lt;/ref&gt; While Tsukasa also addresses Momoyo with polite tones, it seems that this is mostly for appearances, as Tsukasa does not seem to respect Momoyo's intelligence very much.

;[[Chimata Tenkyuu]]
Like with the other antagonists of ''Unconnected Marketeers'', Tsukasa addresses Chimata in polite tones, but for her own gain. Chimata seems to recognize this double-sidedness in Tsukasa, refusing Tsukasa's requests and sending her away at the end of ''Unconnected Marketeers'', considering bargaining with the kuda-gitsune to be a worthless endeavour. {{citation needed}}

===Minor relationships===
;[[Misumaru Tamatsukuri]]
Misumaru does not seem particularly enthralled by Tsukasa's manipulations, considering her a nuisance as Tsukasa disrupts Misumaru's attempts at a conflict-free resolution to the incident.

{{hidden end}}

==Additional Information==
Tsukasa is a unique character in several ways.
*She was the first midboss-only character introduced since [[Soga no Tojiko]] in ''[[Ten Desires]]'', from ten years prior.
*She is the only midboss-only character to have dialogue portraits, an in-game name and title introduction, and a significant role in the plot.
**She is ''technically'' not the only midboss-only character to have in-game dialogue, if one counts Tojiko's lines during [[Toyosatomimi no Miko]]'s spell card, [[Ten_Desires/Spell_Cards/Stage_6#Boss Spell Card #3|Summon "Royal Clan's Chaotic Dance"]].
*She and [[Rin Kaenbyou]] are the only ''Touhou'' characters to appear as midbosses in three consecutive stages.
**Unlike Rin, Tsukasa keeps the same appearance throughout all of her encounters, and was never the main boss in any stage.
*She is the only enemy character who uses [[spell card|spell cards]] but never with a spell background.

In reality, she's a troublemaker who brings about chaos by slipping into the cracks in a target's heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

She seems rather busy, being tasked with ferrying messages between the Great Tengu and the market god, giving instructions to the oomukade, and so on.&lt;br&gt;
She's trusted by the Great Tengu, the market god, and even the oomukade, and they each consult with her in various ways.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

But her true nature is that of a kuda-gitsune.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Those who listen to her advice will surely receive financial benefits,&lt;br&gt;
but you mustn't forget that a destructive result awaits you in return.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

In the end, her whispers were the source of trouble that roped both the market god and the oomukade into fighting Reimu and co.

This [[kitsune]] is a [[youkai]] that first appeared in ''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'' chapter 8.

==Concept==
[[File:WaHHKudagitsuneMarisa.png|thumb|150px|Unnamed kitsune disguised as Marisa Kirisame in [[Wild and Horned Hermit]]]]
===Appearance===
Her appearance is that of a small fox. She can change her appearance into other characters like [[Marisa Kirisame]] and [[Sanae Kochiya]]. When in disguise, she can be identified by her ears, tail, and noticeable canine tooth.

===Personality===
Her personality is manipulative. She is capable of making herself look innocent by picking on someone's weak point such as Reimu's desire for money and creating trust in order to deceive them.

===Occupation===
Her temporary occupation was helping [[Reimu Hakurei]] gather worshipers.

===Ability===
;Ability to disguise things and herself
She can change her appearance like all fox [[youkai]]. This ability also allows her to change objects like leaves into money.

==Story==
[[File:WaHHKudagitsuneSanae.png|thumb|150px|Unnamed kitsune disguised as Sanae Kochiya in [[Wild and Horned Hermit]]]]
;''Wild and Horned Hermit''
The unnamed kitsune first appeared in chapter 8 being disguised as Marisa Kirisame after a party as the [[Hakurei Shrine]]. Using money, she managed to get Reimu Hakurei on her good side. When the real Marisa arrives she takes the form of Sanae Kochiya and after Marisa leaves, she tells Reimu a plan to gain more wealth.

In chapter 9, she reappears being beaten and tied up by Reimu. She plays a minor role by being an example of the victims of Reimu's meaningless attacks on youkai and giving Reimu the image of a hypocrite towards [[Mamizou Futatsuiwa]] and Kasen Ibaraki.

She appears once again in chapter 30, curious about a "foxball" Reimu was displaying at the shrine. She explains that the mysterious object can't be a foxball because its energy is different from that of a fox.

===Relationships===
;[[Reimu Hakurei]]
Using her ability, she and Reimu Hakurei gathered worshipers. Reimu was however being manipulated by the fox.

;[[Unnamed kuda-gitsune]]
The kuda-gitsune was helping Reimu under the unnamed kitsune.

==Additional Information==
===Trivia===
*She is the third character/group to disguise as Marisa Kirisame. The first being the [[Monster Tanuki]] and the second being the [[Three Fairies of Light]] in their poor attempt to mimic the [[tanuki]].

{{nihongo|'''Unshou'''|運松}} is a fisherman turned doctor and resident of the [[Human Village]].

==Character Design==
===Origin===
Unshou may have been based on {{nihongo|Takatori Unshouan|鷹取 運松庵}}, a doctor from [[wikipedia:Chikuzen Province|Chikuzen Province]], or modern [[wikipedia:Fukuoka Prefecture|Fukuoka Prefecture]], [[wikipedia:Kyushu|Kyushu]], during the [[wikipedia:Genroku|Genroku period]]. Legend has it his wife was touched by a [[kappa]] while in the bathroom and she cut off his arm. The kappa asked Takatori for the return of his arm, but he resisted. Again, the kappa asked and promised not to attack his wife again. Takatori asked what he wanted the arm for and the kappa said he would reattach it. Takatori said it was impossible, but if the kappa taught him how to do so, then he would reconnect the severed limb himself. In return, the kappa gave Takatori a special medicine that could heal cuts more effectively.

===Name===
The first kanji of Unshou, {{lang|ja|運}}, means fortune or luck. The second, {{lang|ja|松}}, simply means pine.

===Design===
Unshou is of advanced age and has the typical appearance of an old man. He is bald, with bushy eyebrows, eyes which are always squinted, and a goatee. He wears a kimono with sandals.

==Story==
;''Wild and Horned Hermit''
He is introduced in ''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'' chapter 11, as a fisherman who becomes a doctor that can heal any injury. As he demonstrates his newfound ability to the [[Human Village]], a previously injured [[Marisa Kirisame]] comes upon him. Unshou heals her wound and the story is then related to [[Kasen Ibaraki]].

After Kasen silently sneaks into his house for surveillance, she visits him the next day while he is fishing, and confronts him about the medicine and his claim about even being able to heal a missing arm. He states he gained his ability from [[Kappa's Nostrum|medicine obtained from a kappa]], which he received when he exchanged a kappa's arm he found.

Before they part, Unshou deduces Kasen's identity as a [[hermit]]. He apologizes and says it may be just his imagination, gained from intuition honed by staying on the mountain so often. As she leaves, she says to herself that Unshou is hermit-like.

{{nihongo|'''Unzan'''|雲山}} is an old, [[male]] [[nyuudou]] controlled by [[Ichirin Kumoi]]. Being a cloud spirit, Unzan's true form is a mystery. Along with Ichirin, he guards the [[Palanquin Ship]] of his own accord in order to assist in the revival of [[Byakuren Hijiri]].

==General Information==
Unzan, along with [[Ichirin Kumoi]], first appeared as the Third stage boss of ''[[Undefined Fantastic Object]]'' and later both as a playable character of ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]''. As part of a team with Ichirin, they work together to face their challenges.

===Personality===
Unzan is a shy, but overbearing nyuudou who'll only talk to [[Ichirin Kumoi]]. However, when he really is angry, he'll thunder out.&lt;ref name="interview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otIrJdoaITI|title=Interview with Chara☆Mel|access-date=27 August 2011|author=Chara☆Mel|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unzan is quiet and stubborn, with a strong sense of duty. While once feared, together with Ichirin, they rarely attack anyone.

===Ability===
;Changing shape and size at will
He is able to make his fists giant and strike the opponent and shoot unique [[danmaku]]. He can multiply, expand and change form as he wishes, as shown in his ''Rage "First and Last of Its Kind Scolding Scorch"'' spell card. He cannot outright transform into a different being, however.

==Backstory==
His (and Ichirin's) [[Symposium of Post-mysticism/Ichirin Kumoi &amp; Unzan|Symposium of Post-mysticism article]] gives him the following backstory:

Unzan once was a normal man-eating foreseeing nyuudou. Ichirin, who then was a human girl, dauntlessly went to encounter him and give him a scare when she first heard of him. When she finally saw what looked like the feet of a monk, taking care not to raise her head, she shouted "The foreseeing nyuudou was foreseen!", a repelling spell.&lt;ref name="nyuudou"&gt;Foreseeing nyuudou are youkai monks who only show their feet at first. When their victim would look up to see their face, they would grow larger so that their heads would remain out of sight. It's been said that when the victim looks straight up, their head would get chopped off.&lt;/ref&gt; While that would normally be enough to make a nyuudou disappear, the sheer shock of his utter defeat and resulting admiration for the courageous girl prompted Unzan to devote the rest of his life to protecting her.

By the time of ''Undefined Fantastic Object'', Ichirin and Unzan have both joined [[Byakuren Hijiri]] due to her acceptance of youkai as well as her understanding of the human heart.

==Background Information==
===Origin===
A possible source of inspiration for the Unzan and Ichirin character is an [http://www.obakemono.com/obake/tsukumogami/ old Japanese tale] about [[tsukumogami]] (youkai born from an old object attaining a spirit of its own after being around for 100 years). This story features a tsukumogami born from a Buddhist rosary called Ichiren Nyuudou.

===Name===
His name is {{nihongo|''Unzan''|雲山}}, which means "Clouded Mountain" or "Mountain of Clouds". A nyuudou cloud ([[Wikipedia:ja:入道雲|入道雲]]) is a Japanese term for [[wikipedia:Cumulonimbus cloud|cumulonimbus cloud]] or thunderhead. Unzan being purple is a reference to the purple cloud leading to where Myouren was.

===Design===
The sprite of Unzan in ''Undefined Fantastic Object'' and ''Hopeless Masquerade'' shows that he is a pink/reddish cloud with the face of an old man with a beard. Due to his ability, he's shown to have multiple fists and heads.

==Unzan's Appearances==
{{stub|section}}
===Games===
;''Undefined Fantastic Object''
:{{Main|Undefined Fantastic Object/Story|l1=Undefined Fantastic Object Story}}
Unzan stands guard with Ichirin at the Palanquin Ship in order to keep those who would prevent [[Byakuren Hijiri]]'s revival away. During their battle with the heroine, he uses his fists as projectiles to try and defeat the heroine.
===Spin-offs===
;''Hopeless Masquerade''
Unzan acts as the support of Ichirin, perfoming attacks for her while Ichirin fights characters who wanted revenge from their lose against [[Byakuren Hijiri]]

;''Urban Legend in Limbo''
Unzan supports Ichirin in her search for seven Occult Balls, helping her both punching the opponent or in her spell cards.

;''Antinomy of Common Flowers''
Unzan accompanies Ichirin and [[Mononobe no Futo]], who help [[Toyosatomimi no Miko]] and [[Byakuren Hijiri]] in their investigation about the Perfect Possesion. 

Whenever Ichirin is switched out in Perfect Posession, Unzan loses consciousness, too.

[[File:WaHHUnzan.png|thumb|right|200px|Unzan in ''Wild and Horned Hermit'']]
===Literature===
;''Wild and Horned Hermit''
In Chapter 44, after hearing [[Byakuren]] say they didn't have time or money to organize something for the celebration of the paranirvana day (the day Budda died), [[Ichirin Kumoi]] suggests her asking Unzan to become a budda statue. [[Kasen Ibara]] notices this and tells [[Reimu Hakurei]] and [[Sanae Kochiya]] about the real origin of the statue. Although Reimu tricked [[Ichirin]] threating to tell the truth to everyone and Unzan had to become a statue for Reimu too, the festival ended succesfully. However, Unzan ended exhausted and complaining about it.

==Relationships==
;[[Ichirin Kumoi]]
The Wheel That Guards, Unzan's life is devoted to watching over Ichirin, his partner and handler. Since he is very shy, he talks quietly and only to her, causing her to be his spokeswoman of sorts.

;[[Koishi Komeiji]]
Unzan is revealed to be able to notice Koishi before Ichirin does and apparently gets along well enough to have Koishi call him "Uncle Nyuudo".&lt;ref&gt;Ichirin's Story Mode in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

*Unzan is the first male character to appear in a [[Windows]] game.
*Unzan is (may be) the first male character in the ''[[Touhou Project]]'' to have become a playable character – in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]''.

{{nihongo|'''Urumi Ushizaki'''|牛崎 潤美|Ushizaki Urumi}} is an ushi-oni who runs a fishery at the [[Sanzu River]]. Though she was once a fearsome youkai who attacked humans, she now leads a relatively peaceful life, and sometimes turns lost travelers back from the river.&lt;ref name="WBaWCP"/&gt;  Urumi first appeared as the Stage 2 mid-boss and [[Boss]] in ''[[Wily Beast and Weakest Creature]]''.

==General Information==

===Personality===
She's initially surprised to see the protagonists attempting to fly over the river, and threatens them in an attempt to chase them off (or possibly just to get some excitement, since the protagonists are strong enough to be considered "fair game" by some youkai). Despite her initial hostility, she helpfully points them toward [[Higan]] and casually chats with them after being defeated, and asks them to tell her stories about Hell on their way back.

===Abilities===
;Changing the weight of everyday objects
Urumi can change the weight of things she is close to. This is seen in her fight in [[Wily Beast and Weakest Creature]] with her enlarging her danmaku.

===Occupation===
Back then, Urumi was known for her cruelty in attacking humans. Even since that was forbidden in Gensokyo, she currently runs a fishery located at the [[Sanzu River]]. In her day-to-day life, Urumi tends to the prehistoric fish that live in the river and sometimes sells them in Gensokyo. &lt;ref name="WBaWCP"/&gt;  Occasionally, she's also known for sending those who mistakenly attempt to cross the river back into their original world.

===Possessions===
;Stone Baby
Urumi possesses a heavy stone in a shape of an infant, which she presumably uses to lure and drown people with it.

==Character Design==
===Origin===
Urumi is an ''ushi-oni'' ({{lang|ja|牛鬼}}, lit. "cow oni"), a [[youkai]] typically depicted as a giant spider with a cow's head and vicious claws. Ushi-oni folklore varies greatly from region to region, but Urumi appears to be specifically based on folklore from the [[wikipedia:San'in_region|San'in region]]: a woman asks a passerby to hold her baby, only for the baby to turn to stone and weigh them down, while the ushi-oni emerges from a nearby body of water to attack. The concept of "a woman who hands passersby an unexpectedly heavy baby" is shared by the [[wikipedia:Nure-onna|''nure-onna'']] ({{lang|ja|濡女}}, lit. "wet woman"), which may also have served as inspiration for Urumi.

===Name===
Her full name is {{nihongo|''Urumi Ushizaki''|牛崎 潤美}}. ''Urumi'' is spelled with the characters ''uru'' ({{lang|ja|潤}}), meaning "moist", and ''mi'' ({{lang|ja|美}}), meaning "beauty". The word ''urumi'' ({{lang|ja|潤み}}) is also a common noun meaning "moisture", presumably in reference to the ''nure-onna'' youkai mentioned above. Incidentally, "[[wikipedia:Urumi|urumi]]" is also the name of a flexible sword that originates from the Indian subcontinent.

''Ushizaki'' is spelled with the characters ''ushi'' ({{lang|ja|牛}}), meaning "bovine", and ''zaki/saki'' ({{lang|ja|崎}}), meaning "[[wikipedia:Cape_(geography)|cape]]". The on'yomi reading of the characters also happens to be ''gyuuki'', which is the same as the on'yomi reading of Urumi's species ({{lang|ja|牛鬼}}). Her surname is also a homophone for ''ushi-zaki'' ({{lang|ja|牛裂き}}, lit. "cow tearing"), a form of execution where the condemned was tied to bulls before being drawn and quartered.

===Design===
Urumi wears a loose cow-spotted jacket with black borders over a yellow crop-top with long yellow shorts. She wears sandals and holds a baby-shaped stone in her arms. She has horns like an [[Oni]], though she is not a Hell Oni but an [[Ushi-Oni]]. Half of her hair is black, the other half is light grey. She has a light tan and bright red eyes. She also has cow ears and a tail.

==Appearances==
[[File:Th17UrumiSprite.png|frame|right|Urumi's sprite in ''[[Wily Beast and Weakest Creature|WBaWC]]'']]
===Games===
;''Wily Beast and Weakest Creature''
While the heroines got lost in the middle of the Sanzu River, she appears and offers to return the heroines back to where they came from, but was replied rudely. She then wanted to feed the heroines to the ancient fish living in the Sanzu River, but has failed. Her fight lead the heroines to Higan, which was their destination.
==Relationships==
'''[[Komachi Onozuka]] (possibly)'''

On [[Wily Beast and Weakest Creature/Story/Marisa's Scenario (Wolf)|Marisa's Wolf Scenario]], she mentioned that Marisa could've asked the shinigami to take her to Higan. This could possibly imply that Urumi and Komachi know each other to an extent.

Ability: Capable of changing the weight of everyday objects&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

A fearsome [[oni]] who drags living creatures beneath the [[Sanzu River]]'s waves.&lt;br /&gt;
She carries a stone carving of a baby. Once she gives the baby to someone to hold, she makes it heavier and submerges them in the river. She was an awe-inspiring youkai who took advantage of humans' kindness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

However, since she's forbidden to attack humans in Gensokyo, she currently runs a fishery at the Sanzu River.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

If one tries to cross the river without a [[shinigami]]'s permission, they'll be attacked by creatures like extinct giant fish and plesiosaurs. Nowadays, she spends her time domesticating those giant fish and makes a living wage by sometimes selling them in Gensokyo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Some youkai view this defanged state of hers as deserving of mockery, but she's quite proud of her current life.&lt;br /&gt;
Occasionally, she also guides those who mistakenly attempt to cross the Sanzu River back to their original world.

{{nihongo|'''Utsuho Reiuji'''|霊烏路 空|Reiuji Utsuho}} is the main antagonist of [[Subterranean Animism]]. She's one of [[Satori Komeiji]]'s pets and a [[Hell]] [[raven]] who has lived in the underground world since before it was separated from Hell. Her job is to regulate the flames of the [[Hell of Blazing Fires]].

==General Information==
Utsuho first appeared as the Final [[Boss]] of ''[[Subterranean Animism]]'', and was indirectly the main reason that the events of ''[[Undefined Fantastic Object]]'' occurred.  She also appeared as a playable character in ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]'', appearing as a boss in [[Sanae Kochiya]] and [[Cirno]]'s scenario. She was a target on Stage 8 in ''[[Double Spoiler]]'' and appeared in the background of ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]''.
===Personality===
Utsuho has a simple and direct personality, it can even be said that she's airheaded. &lt;ref name="SoPM"&gt; Utsuho's article in ''[[Symposium of Post-mysticism/Utsuho Reiuji|Symposium of Post-mysticism]]''&lt;/ref&gt; .
In fact, she misunderstood what [[Kanako Yasaka]] told her ("We can use that to bring about the wishes of not just the underground, but the above ground as well.") and believed that she had to use her new power to take over Gensokyo. 
Furthermore, when [[Sanae Kochiya]] told her that she is the shrine maiden that serves Kanako, Utsuho said she doesn't know that it's her; and after fighting, Utsuho didn't even remember the purpose of the fight and believes Sanae when she said that Utsuho was following Sanae's orders &lt;ref&gt; Sanae's route, ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]'' &lt;/ref&gt;

===Abilities===
;Manipulation of Nuclear Fusion
{{main|Touhou and Modern Science#Nuclear Fusion as a Source of Green Energy|l1=Touhou and Modern Science: Nuclear Fusion as a Source of Green Energy}}
[[File:GoMIllus-Utsuho.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Utsuho, as illustrated in ''[[The Grimoire of Marisa]]'']]
Her abilities come from the god of nuclear fusion, Yatagarasu, and were granted to her by [[Kanako Yasaka]] in the god's attempt to turn the [[Hell of Blazing Fires]] into an energy source for [[Gensokyo]]. After absorbing the god, Utsuho obtained the ''left leg "the leg of fission"'' and the ''right leg "the leg of fusion"'', along with the ''third leg'' (a nuclear control rod in her right hand). As a result, she is able to manipulate the ultimate energy, nuclear fusion. Essentially, this means that Utsuho's own body actually houses a [[divine spirit]], technically making her into a branch shrine for Yatagarasu. Apparently, the duller the holder of the power, the better they can utilize it. The red eye on her chest is proof that Utsuho obtained the power of fusion by absorbing Yatagarasu because the god's eyes are red, according to [[Cage in Lunatic Runagate/Third Chapter|Chapter Three]] of ''[[Cage in Lunatic Runagate]]''.

In the [[outside world]], the prospects of putting this to use have still not been reached, and thus can surely be said to be an illusionary power.

[[Yatagarasu]] is the [[wikipedia:ja:ミサキ|Misaki God]] of the [[wikipedia:ja:日本神話|Nihon Shinwa]]. In [[wikipedia:Nihon Shoki|Nihon Shoki]], as the messenger and envoy of highest sun god of the Nihon Shinwa, {{nihongo|[[wikipedia:Amaterasu|Amaterasu Oomikami]]|天照大神}}, Yatagarasu is considered the incarnation of the sun. It has been said that Yatagarasu possibly lives in the sun.

That is, it means that she's able to manipulate the same temperature as the the highest heating power in the natural world, the sun (Furthermore, by the spells that she uses, she is also able to spring forth the same gravitational attraction). However, Utsuho can't keep creating energy forever on her own because she would run out of "fusion material" and as explained in one of the endings for ''[[Subterranean Animism]]'', she needs to get the atoms used in the fusion process from someone else.

===Occupation===
Utsuho's job is to manage the temperature inside the [[Hell of Blazing Fires]], by either opening the skylight above the Hell of Blazing Fires's courtyard to lower the temperature, or feeding the fires with the corpses carried by Orin.

==Character Design==
[[File:ThGKUtsuho.png|thumb|200px|Utsuho, as illustrated in ''[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]]'']]
===Origin===
In ancient Chinese mythology, the three-legged [[crow]] is a mythical animal associated with the Sun, thought to be its guardian beast or, more often, the manifestation of the Sun's deity. This explains Utsuho's nuclear fusion power and association with heat. This myth of the three-legged crow and the fact that the crow [[tengu]] [[Aya Shameimaru]] calls her "hell crow" twice may be why people refer to her as a crow, even though she's a [[raven]]. (Actually, most Japanese don't distinguish raven from crow, except zoologists and curious people. The fact that both raven and crow are from the corvus genus doesn't help.)

===Name===
Her full name is {{nihongo|''Utsuho Reiuji''|霊烏路 空}}. The characters for {{nihongo||霊烏路|Reiuji}} literally mean, in succession, "soul/spirit", "crow/raven", and "path". {{nihongo||空|Utsuho}} means "emptiness/empty-hole/cave" in [[Wikipedia:Old Japanese|Old Japanese]], in which it is pronounced "utsuho". This is an example of a Japanese counterpart to [[Wikipedia:Spelling pronunciation|spelling pronunciation]]. The character for ''Utsuho'' also means "sky" and can be pronounced "kuu" in a compound word.

Because of this, her nickname is {{nihongo||おくう|Okuu}}, which was first used by [[Rin Kaenbyou]] to refer to Utsuho in the [[Subterranean Animism/Translation/Extra Story|Extra Stage prologue]]. At first, only the "{{lang|ja|おくう}}" spelling used in ''[[Subterranean Animism]]'' was [[canon]] and "{{lang|ja|お空}}" (spelling using the kanji from her actual name) was not, but after [[Aya Shameimaru]] called her "{{lang|ja|お空}}" in the comment of scene 8-6 in ''[[Double Spoiler]]'', both became canon; this was used again in the data files for ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]''. {{nihongo|"O-kuu"|おくう}} can also be a pun of {{nihongo|"Oku-u"|屋烏||lit. "a crow standing on a roof"}}, though this is likely not intentional.

===Design===
Utsuho has long dark brown hair. Wears a white short-sleeved shirt with a red "eye" in the center, a short green skirt, and a green hair-ribbon. On her right arm, she wears a device reminiscent of a nuclear control rod. She also wears a cape that's white on the outside and a starry pattern on the inside; the cape is kept aloft by her black wings. Her right foot is encased in congealed matter, representing the "elephant's foot" of Chernobyl, a mass of cooled radioactive material and glass. Her left ankle is orbited by electrons.

On the Interview of [[Cara☆Mel‎]] vol.8, [[ZUN]] mentioned that he tried to keep her from being indecent during the design process by adding a [[cannon]] on her arm instead of having an additional leg, thus solving the analogy of the third leg of the Yatagarasu.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm5903008 Interview on Subterranean Animism with Cara☆Mel‎] (Nico Nico Video link)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearances==
;''Subterranean Animism''
[[File:Th11UtsuhoSprite.png|frame|Utsuho's sprite in ''SA'']]
Before the events of ''[[Subterranean Animism]]'', she was told by [[Kanako Yasaka|a voice]] that she could swallow the god, Yatagarasu, that was hidden in the flames to gain a power that would fulfill the wishes of both the worlds below and above the surface. This power was nuclear fusion. Utsuho misunderstood what the voice had told her, and decided that, using these powers, she would take over [[Gensokyo]]. Her friend, [[Rin Kaenbyou]], became worried about Utsuho, and drove evil spirits to the surface to cause an incident among the strong [[youkai]] above ground, in hope that they would come down to do something about it and, when they got there, defeat Utsuho and bring her back to her former self. What came, however, was not a strong youkai, but a strong [[human]].

;''Undefined Fantastic Object''
In ''[[Undefined Fantastic Object]]'', it is revealed that the geyser she created with her newfound powers wound up blowing [[Byakuren Hijiri]]'s ship out from the underground and into the sky, thus starting the plot of that game.

===Spin-offs===
;''Touhou Hisoutensoku''
Utsuho becomes a playable character in ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]''. She treats [[Sanae Kochiya]] and [[Cirno]] as objects interfering in the fusion process that can possibly cause malfunction to the core and attempts to eliminate them, after both fall in the [[Underground Geyser Center]] where she lives.

;''Double Spoiler''
[[File:Th135Utsuho.png|frame|Utsuho in ''HM'']]
In ''[[Double Spoiler]]'', Utsuho appeared as a [[stage]] 8 target, where she uses a few [[spell card]]s and had [[Aya Shameimaru]] and [[Hatate Himekaidou]] take photos of her and her [[danmaku]].

;''Hopeless Masquerade''
Utsuho made a background cameo appearance in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'' on the [[Palace of Earth Spirits]] and [[Youkai Tanuki Forest]] stage. She is seen enjoying the fights.

;''Touhou Gouyoku Ibun''
[[File:Th175UtsuhoSprite.gif|thumb|frame|left|100px|Utsuho's sprite in ''GI'']]
Utsuho greets the heroine with fireballs and fights thinking she was the culprit of the petroleum in the reactor. She explains her mission (if the player plays with [[Reimu]]), gets confused about why she was fighting before (if the player plays with the Yorigami sisters), request keeping fighting until the player goes through one of [[Okina]]'s doors (if the player plays with [[Flandre]]) or warns her about an [[Yuuma Toutetsu|enemy]] that could gobble up the Blazing Hell's flames (if the player plays with [[Minamitsu]]). 
===Literature===
;''Wild and Horned Hermit''
In ''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'', Utsuho's Yatagarasu powers are stated as an imperfect power source by [[Sanae Kochiya]].

==Relationships==
===[[Satori Komeiji]]===
She's one of Satori Komeiji's pets. In order to maintain the [[Hell of Blazing Fires]] and [[Palace of Earth Spirits]] working in proper order, Satori appointed various jobs to her pets. 

===[[Kanako Yasaka]]===
She tells Utsuho in a dream to consume [[Yatagarasu]] and this gives her nuclear powers. However, she misunderstands her and uses these powers in a attempt to take over [[Gensokyo]], which causes the events of ''[[Subterranean Animism]]''.

===[[Rin Kaenbyou]]===
Utsuho and [[Rin Kaenbyou]] are really old friends, since before the [[Underworld]] separated from [[Hell]]. They've known each other even before Satori started taking care of them.

===Minor Characters===
;[[Koishi Komeiji]] 
She is her master Satori's younger sister.

==Additional Information==
*A silhouette of Utsuho occupies the front of ''[[Subterranean Animism]]'''s jewel case.
*Her "Third Leg" resembles an arm [[cannon]]. In ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]'', it is used as one.
*Utsuho appears to be the only final [[boss]] in a [[Windows]] game whose goal is explicitly conquering the world. A very common goal for villains in cartoons.
*Utsuho is also the one of the two only final bosses in a game who is a subordinate of an earlier boss (Satori). The other being [[Shinmyoumaru Sukuna]] ([[Seija Kijin]])
*Utsuho is one of the two only bosses in a Windows game that gives the player a warning before the spell card begins; "☢ CAUTION!! ☢" appears for a few moments with [[wikipedia:klaxon|Klaxons]] blaring in the background. The other one belongs to Koishi, which warning Klaxons blare in the background in the "Philosophy of a Hated Person" spell card.
*Her sprite animations in ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]'' greatly resemble and are most likely a homage to sprite animation of [[wikipedia:List of Fist of the North Star characters#Souther|Souther]] from the game [[w:Fist of the North Star (2005 video game)|Fist of the North Star PS2 version]]. ([https://onsen.touhouwiki.net/wiki/File:Utsuho_similarities_.png Comparison]).
**Her spell card [https://youtu.be/jIi-S9AMQKI&amp;t=116 "Crow Sign: Yatagarasu Dive"] resembles Souther's Fatal K.O. move [https://youtu.be/5KUYk2Rpn_4&amp;t=177 Nanto Hō-ōh Ken Ougi: Tenshou Juuji Hou]. Because of this fans sometimes call that spell card Nanto Hō-'''Ōkuu''' Ken Ougi: Tenshou Juuji Hou. 
*** "Crow Sign: Yatagarasu Dive" does also resembles one of the Souther's move [https://youtu.be/5KUYk2Rpn_4&amp;t=127  Houshou Juuji Hou] 
*In Utsuho's Spell Cards, the background behind the trefoil is a photo of the [[wikipedia:Carina Nebula|Carina Nebula]]. 
*Utsuho's spell card background also features a real-world picture of a cat on the trefoil. One reason [[ZUN]] might've included this in the background could be because of the wild cats that have colonized the abandoned city of [[Wikipedia:Pripyat|Pripyat]]. Pripyat was the town created for the families of workers at [[Wikipedia:Chernobyl|Chernobyl]] in Ukraine, and after the [[Wikipedia:Chernobyl disaster|disaster]] that happened there, the population was evacuated. Recent excursions back into the ghost town lead to the discovery of a small community of irradiated wild cats that live comfortably in the foundations of abandoned homes.
**Furthering the Chernobyl links, Utsuho could be a reference to the so-called [http://www.unknownexplorers.com/blackbirdofchernobyl.php Black Bird of Chernobyl] not only because of her massive black wings, but also because the red eye in her chest, which was another trait of the Black Bird.
*In the [[PC-98]] game ''[[Story of Eastern Wonderland]]'', there was an orange-like shine on Stage 4 in the background that was shaped like the orb that Utsuho points to in her ''[[Subterranean Animism]]'' portrait. Utsuho's orb also resembles the [[shining object]]s, a [[stage enemy]] of the same game.

　　　左足に『分解の足』&lt;br/&gt;
　　　右足に『融合の足』&lt;br/&gt;
　　　そして右手にそれらを制御する『第三の足』

　　彼女はこれらの三本足で究極のエネルギーを操作するという。

　　永い眠りについた火焔地獄跡の上に地霊殿はあった。&lt;br/&gt;
　　地底世界が地獄のものでは無くなった今、ここに罪人が落とされる事は無く、今では元々棲んでいた地獄鴉、死体を運ぶ火車、他に物好きな妖怪達と、恨みだけで動く怨霊しか住んでいなかった。&lt;br/&gt;
　　さとりは、自分の物となったその場所にペット達を住まわせた。

　　空も燐と同じ、さとりのペットの一匹である。

　　燐は怨霊を、空は火焔地獄跡が暴走しないか見張っていた。&lt;br/&gt;
　　彼女の仕事は、少しでも火が強くなったら中庭の天窓を開け、火力が衰えたら燐が運んできた死体を投げ込み、火力を調整する事。&lt;br/&gt;
　　毎日毎日、同じ事の繰り返してはあったが、平和で満足のいく生活を送っていた。&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

　　しかし、ある日を境にその日常が崩れてしまう。

　　何者かが地上から、誰にも気付かれる事なく火焔地獄跡まで一気に入り込んできたのだ。&lt;br/&gt;

　　彼女は光に包まれ、何者かが体に入り込んでくるのを感じた。&lt;br/&gt;
　　気付いた時には彼女の姿は大きく変化していた。

　　空は手に入れた力を使うのが楽しくて、気が付いたら灼熱地獄跡は熱さを取り戻していた。&lt;br/&gt;
　　その熱は地底の水を熱し、水蒸気の圧力が限界に達した時に間欠泉となって地上に吹き出していたのである。

　　地上から訪れた者。&lt;br/&gt;

| translation = Stage 6 Boss '''Scorching, Troublesome Divine Flame'''&lt;br/&gt;
Utsuho Reiuji&lt;br/&gt;
Nickname: Okuu

Race: Hell raven with [[Yatagarasu]]&lt;br/&gt;
Ability: Manipulating nuclear fusion

A crow that gives off a conspicuously-colored light.

　On her left leg is the "Leg of fission";&lt;br/&gt;
　On her right leg is the "Leg of fusion";&lt;br/&gt;
　Finally, on her right arm is that which controls this, the "Third Leg"

Using these three legs, it's said she can control the ultimate energy.

When she awoke after a long sleep, the Earth Spirit Palace stood above what was once the Hell of Blazing Fires. In this time when the underground was no longer part of hell, criminals were no longer banished underground, and the only ones that lived underground now were the hell ravens, the kasha that carried off the bodies of the dead, and various other curious youkai, as well as the evil spirits who only acted out of malice. Satori took the youkai who lived there as her own and raised them as pets.

Utsuho and Rin were both Satori's pets.

Rin and Utsuho both worked hard at their respective jobs, Rin at controlling the evil spirits, Utsuho at managing the former Hell of Blazing Fires. If the flames became too hot, they'd open the skylight in the courtyard; if the flames became too weak, they'd throw in more of the corpses Rin carried off; they regulated the flames in this manner. They lived out their lives this way, doing the same thing every day but leading a peaceful, satisfying life.



However, one day that peaceful lifestyle was shattered.

Someone from above stole into Hell without anyone noticing.&lt;br/&gt;
Then, she began to speak.&lt;br/&gt;
Her voice stoked Utsuho's curiosity.

"The Hell of Blazing Fires hides the secret to the ultimate form of energy that humans can attain.&lt;br/&gt;
You, crow that lives within the blaze ...&lt;br/&gt;
You should be able to contain that power within your body.&lt;br/&gt;
We can use that to bring about the wishes of not just the underground, but the above ground as well."

She was enveloped in light, and she felt someone entering her body.&lt;!-- !!! --&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
When she came to, her body had changed greatly.

Utsuho enjoyed using her new power, and before she knew it the Hell of Blazing Fires had regained its original heat.&lt;br/&gt;
That heat boiled the water in the underground, and when the steam pressure reached its limits it boiled over into the above ground as a geyser.

　The one from above ground.&lt;br/&gt;
　Who was she, and what was her purpose?&lt;br/&gt;
　Utsuho quickly pushed such questions from her little head.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

　 - Yatagarasu, the divine three-legged crow&lt;br/&gt;
　　　The power that had entered her body was the god called the Yatagarasu.&lt;br/&gt;
　　　It's said to be a three-legged crow that lives on the sun.

　　　The ultimate power the Yatagarasu possessed was the power to create atoms, nuclear fusion.&lt;br/&gt;
　　　Atomic energy is the ultimate fantasy left for the future.

{{nihongo|'''Wakasagihime'''|わかさぎ姫|Wakasagihime}} is a [[mermaid]] who lives in the [[Misty Lake]] and appears as the stage 1 boss in ''[[Double Dealing Character]]''.

==General Information==
Wakasagihime is a normally quiet, peaceful youkai mermaid who lives in the [[Misty Lake]], singing songs and picking up stones. However, thanks to the Miracle Mallet's power, she became ferocious; after the incident was resolved, she went back to being her normal self.

==Personality== 

In her profile, she's stated to be quite quiet and very composed. 

Perhaps as a direct result of being a mermaid, she benefits from increased power while underwater. Apparently she either keeps a low profile or everyone nearby just ignores her, as all playable characters in ''[[Double Dealing Character]]'' are quite surprised to see her there. [[Kagerou Imaizumi]] is surprised to hear of her attacking people, claiming that she is usually so timid that she wouldn't even kill a bug. Along with Kagerou, she is one of the few known members of the [[grassroots youkai network]].

===Abilities===
;Grows in power when underwater
She seems to get stronger when submerged in water, although it's boosts appears to be nominal as she was soundly defeated by Reimu, Marisa, and Sakuya without much effort.

==Character Design==
===Name===
{{nihongo|''Wakasagihime''|わかさぎ姫}} is derived from {{nihongo|[[wikipedia:Wakasagi|wakasagi]]|ワカサギ}}, a fish native to northern Japan. {{nihongo|''Wakasa''|わかさ}} in Wakasagihime may also be a reference to [[wikipedia:Wakasa Province|Wakasa]] (若狭), the birthplace of a woman from the Japanese [[wikipedia:Ningyo|ningyo (mermaid)]] tale ''[[wikipedia:Ningyo#Yao_Bikuni|Yao Bikuni]]''. The suffix {{nihongo|''hime''|姫}} means "princess" and was generally given to girls of noble status. As such, her name can be translated as "''Princess Wakasagi''", though she is not a literal princess.

===Design===
Wakasagihime has dark blue hair and eyes, as well as small fins in the place of ears. She wears a frilly green leaf-patterned kimono which fades to teal at the bottom. In the place of legs, she has a blue-grey fish tail ending in two large fins.

==Appearances==
;''Double Dealing Character''
[[File:Th14WakasagihimeSprite.png|frame|Wakasagihime's sprite in ''DDC'']]
Regardless of who the player is using, Wakasagihime, though normally quiet, attacks her. Though she announces the new reign of youkai, she is defeated handily.
:{{Main|Double Dealing Character/Story/Reimu A's Scenario|l1=Reimu A Arc}}
Wakasagihime recognizes Reimu as the shrine maiden of [[Hakurei Shrine]], and after attacking her, is soundly beaten.
:{{Main|Double Dealing Character/Story/Reimu B's Scenario|l1=Reimu B Arc}}
When she attacks Reimu, she is disappointed that the shrine maiden doesn't seem to have her weapon, as she was expecting to be exterminated. She gets beaten up anyway.
:{{Main|Double Dealing Character/Story/Marisa A's Scenario|l1=Marisa A Arc}}
Wakasagihime announces her intention to elevate her own status among the youkai and attacks Marisa, who is busy being assailed with thoughts about sashimi. She's quickly defeated.
:{{Main|Double Dealing Character/Story/Marisa B's Scenario|l1=Marisa B Arc}}
Marisa is surprised there was a mermaid living in the Misty Lake, and Wakasagihime complains that she is always ignored. Despite her chagrin, she's dealt with easily.
:{{Main|Double Dealing Character/Story/Sakuya A's Scenario|l1=Sakuya A Arc|Double Dealing Character/Story/Sakuya B's Scenario|l2=Sakuya B Arc}}
The mermaid recognizes Sakuya as being from the [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]]. Sakuya is surprised to see a mermaid, but beats her quickly anyway.

;Impossible Spell Card
Presumably, from hearing or seeing a wanted sign about the mischief-making [[amanojaku]] [[Seija Kijin]], Wakasagihime appears to be one of the many [[youkai]] that tries to capture her. She uses [[spell card]]s that are considered impossible to dodge.

==Relationships==
===Kagerou Imaizumi===
Wakasagihime knows [[Kagerou Imaizumi]] thanks to the [[Grassroots Youkai Network]], where she seems to know Wakasagihime's general personality. Kagerou stated that she tried to eat her by mistake at one time.&lt;ref name="DDCMarisaB"&gt;[[Double Dealing Character]]: [[Double Dealing Character/Story/Marisa B's Scenario|Marisa B's Scenario]]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Watatsuki no Toyohime'''|綿月　豊姫}} is a [[Lunarian]] princess who along with her sister [[Watatsuki no Yorihime]] is in charge of the Lunarian Defense Corps.

==General Information==
Toyohime is Yorihime's older sister and one of the Lunarian princesses. She used to be [[Eirin Yagokoro]]'s pupil. 

===Personality===
Though she has a gentle personality and she seems to be innocent, she possesses immense power. She lives an almost carefree life reading books, singing songs or eating the peaches that grow on the [[Moon]], but she doesn't get much exercise. Her responsibilities are to manage the rabbits that they use as emissaries, but it isn't very time-intensive, so she often joins Yorihime while she trains the moon rabbits. 
[[Reisen]] says she secretly gifts peaches from time to time to the rabbits and that she never saw her acting stern as her sister. &lt;ref&gt; ''[[Cage in Lunatic Runagate/Sixth Chapter|Cage in Lunatic Runagate]]'' - Chapter 6&lt;/ref&gt;
===Abilities===
;Good fortune
According to Eirin, Toyohime's good luck is so great that she never had to face any trouble in her life.&lt;ref name="CiLR1"&gt;''[[Cage in Lunatic Runagate/First Chapter|Cage in Lunatic Runagate]]'' - Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt;
;Manipulating the boundary between the scientific and fantastic versions of the Moon
This allows Toyohime to maintain the barrier that protects the Moon. She also killed one of Yukari's crow shikigami by sending it in the airless scientific side.
;Linking "the sea and the mountains"
While the description of this ability seems rather specific, it supposedly allows Toyohime to go "anywhere she likes".&lt;ref&gt;'''''[[Symposium of Post-mysticism/Interview]]:''''' Toyohime has "the ability to connect mountains and seas", which is an ability to move anywhere she likes. Most importantly, she can move between the Lunar Capital and Earth, with Gensokyo being the "mountain" and the moon being the "sea".&lt;/ref&gt;  With the Moon being the "sea" and Gensokyo the "mountain", she was able to send a letter to Eirin, throw a stone on the Earth, and to instantly move herself and [[Reisen]] into Gensokyo. This makes Toyohime, along with Yukari, one of the few characters able to travel freely between the Earth and the Moon (although Yukari requires lunar phases).

===Possessions===
Toyohime carries a fan that is capable of great destruction. When talking to Yukari in the [[Bamboo Forest of the Lost]], she claims that it can cause a wind that would instantly purify the entire forest to atomic level, and that it is supposed to be among the most advanced lunarian weapons.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Silent Sinner in Blue]]'' - Chapter 18&lt;/ref&gt;

==Backstory==
Long ago, Toyohime's master, [[Eirin Yagokoro]], explained to Toyohime why spiriting away happened. Everything is decided on probability, and thus possible events will always happen. This is even how the Lunarians came to the Moon in the first place. Toyohime instantly understood her master's lesson, and from then on, was one of the few people who could connect the Moon and the Earth.

Due to being a student of her master's, she and her sister [[Watatsuki no Yorihime]] were the primary candidates for taking over as leaders of the Lunar Emissaries after Eirin had abandoned the moon over one thousand years ago. Since then, they've been watching over the Earth to keep the Lunar Capital safe. While it was officially their job to find Eirin and bring her back, they eventually gave up on the matter, and never held any ill will towards their teacher.

However, eventually the Lunar Capital had gone under high alert due to several unsettling events. The first Lunar War where [[human]]s landed on the moon a few decades ago concluded without major incident (although it did cause their pet, [[Reisen Udongein Inaba]], to flee to the Earth). Recently, however, several events such as the mysterious disappearance of the [[wikipedia:Flag of the United States|American flag]] from the Near Side of the Moon, reports that someone was calling upon the gods without the proper rites, and the Earth's latest plans to go to the Moon via a project named after an actual prisoner on the Moon has caused all sorts of rumours that there was a traitor in the Lunar Capital. Due to their lack of effort in tracking down Eirin as well as their connections to her, and Yorihime's ability to call upon the gods, the Watatsuki sisters became the primary suspects.

==Character Design==
===Name===
The chosen names for the Watatsuki Sisters make a direct reference to the family history of the Dragon God, who can be referred to alternatively as Ryujin or 'Watatsumi'. Individually, the sisters may refer to the Dragon God's daughters, Toyotama-hime[http://www.goddessaday.com/southeast-asian/toyotama-hime] and her younger sister Tamayori-hime. Considering the events that were revealed in [[Cage in Lunatic Runagate/Third Chapter|Chapter 3 of ''Cage in Lunatic Runagate'']], and that the Dragon Palace and the [[Lunar Capital]] are confirmed to be the the same place,&lt;ref&gt;[[Symposium of Post-mysticism/Interview]]&lt;/ref&gt; it can be rumored that many of the legends about the Dragon Palace in fact took place on the Moon.

===Design===
Long, flowing, sandy blonde hair and golden eyes. Wears a dark blue dress with a strap on the left over a white long-sleeved blouse, a loose belt with a gold mirror-shaped buckle, and a white bonnet with a red ribbon on it when she goes outdoors. Apparently, [[ZUN]] gave vague descriptions about weapons to [[Aki★Eda]], so her drawing Toyohime with a fan as signature item is pretty much improvisation. &lt;ref&gt;'''''[[Symposium_of_Post-mysticism/Interview]]''''': I didn't explain the weapons to Aki★Eda so the depiction was super vague (laugh). Her sister Yorihime is a more ordinary character.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Story==
;''Silent Sinner in Blue''
:{{Main|Silent Sinner in Blue}}

After being warned by [[Eirin Yagokoro]] of the invasion, she apprehends [[Yukari Yakumo]] and [[Ran Yakumo]] in Yukari's second attempt to invade the moon.

;''Cage in Lunatic Runagate''
:{{Main|Cage in Lunatic Runagate}}
After reflecting on the baseless rumors of an upcoming Earth invasion, Toyohime and Yorihime briefly discuss the events 1500 years ago involving Eirin and Kaguya's descent to Earth. It also reveals Eirin as the person behind the old Japanese fable involving the Dragon King's Palace, ''Urashima Tarou'', which is on the moon rather than underwater, and how Toyohime came to give the protagonist of the tale refuge, and how Eirin is the one who orchestrated his return home, which would later cause him to be deified.

==Relationships==
;[[Watatsuki no Yorihime]]
She and Yorihime appear to hold their relationships in high regard.

;[[Eirin Yagokoro]] 
Distantly related to Eirin through marriage to their unnamed husbands (one of the Watatsuki sisters was the wife of Eirin's grandnephew, while the other one was married to their son&lt;ref name="CiLR1" /&gt;), Eirin was also their teacher, whom they treat with much respect and admiration, despite Eirin being a fugitive. Of note is that Toyohime and Yorihime never refer to Eirin Yagokoro as "Eirin", but only as "Lady Yagokoro", as "Eirin" is not her true Lunarian name.

;[[Reisen Udongein Inaba]] 
She was her former pet. They seem to miss their former pet dearly. Reisen is only "Reisen" to the Watatsuki sisters, without her nicknames of Udongein Inaba that Eirin and Kaguya later gave her.

;Reisen 
[[Reisen]] is now her current pet. They treat her just as well.

;[[Moon Capital Gate Guards]] 
They're the Gatekeepers of the Moon Capital.

==Additional Information==
*It's implied she and her sister were the ones primarily responsible for thwarting Yukari's invasion of the Moon long ago, as Yukari specifically points out it's "the Watatsukis" whom she's delighting on taking revenge on in ''[[Silent Sinner in Blue]]'' chapter 21, while also saying in ''[[Cage in Lunatic Runagate]]'''s last chapter that she purposefully executed her revenge in a way that other Lunarians weren't affected by it, but this is not confirmed. Toyohime doesn't react when [[Ran Yakumo]] calls Yukari "Lady Yukari" by name in front of her in Chapter 19 despite revealing in ''Cage in Lunatic Runagate'' that Yukari's very notorious for her invasion of the Moon one-thousand years ago, possibly indicating personal familiarity.
*She and her sister are two of four characters so far known to be/to have been married. The others are [[Seiga Kaku]] and [[Junko]].

'''Watatsuki no Yorihime''' ({{lang|ja|綿月 依姫}}) is a [[Lunarian]] princess who along with her sister [[Watatsuki no Toyohime|Toyohime]] is charge of the Lunarian Defense Corps; she appears to be primarily responsible for training the moon rabbits.

==General Information==
===Personality===
Yorihime is more serious than her sister and it seems she doesn't waste an opportunity to tell her elder sister how carefree she is, specially in her free time, which wastes eating peaches &lt;ref&gt; Chapter 7, ''[[Silent Sinner in Blue]]'' &lt;/ref&gt;

===Abilities===
;Summoning the power of the gods
[[File:SSIB13YorihimePowers.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Yorihime's powers in ''[[Silent Sinner in Blue]]''.]]
Like [[Reimu Hakurei]], Yorihime is able to channel the power of the gods to do her bidding. However, her abilities in this area far outclass those of Reimu, who, at the time of ''[[Silent Sinner in Blue]]'', was only just learning how to do it. With this power, she is able to cause various convenient effects depending on the god she has summoned:
*Caused lightning with the power of Honoikazuchi to attack [[Sakuya Izayoi]]. 
*Dissipated Sakuya's knives through Kanayama-hiko no Mikoto's power, then rematerialized them to attack the maid in a combined attack with Honoikazuchi's lightning.
*Although it wasn't directly shown and the details are unknown, she attacked [[Marisa Kirisame]] with the power of Amatsu-Mikaboshi.
*Summoned Ishikori-dome no Mikoto to reflect one of Marisa Kirisame's lasers with the goddess' divine mirror (the [[wikipedia:Yata_no_Kagami|Yata Mirror]]).
*Calling Ame-no-Uzume into her body, she became immune to [[Remilia Scarlet]]'s bullets embued with the power of the night. The bullets wouldn't hit Yorihime even if she actively tried to touch them.
*Instantly defeated Remilia with a sun-based attack powered by Amaterasu Oomikami.
*Summoned Izunome to purify [[Reimu Hakurei]]'s bullets from the calamitic power of Oomagatsumi.
After defeating Sakuya, Yorihime herself claims to have a myriad of techniques, and that if she was to only use one or two per battle she could win another 39.000.000 times.

;Miscellaneous
Yorihime seems very proficient in swordmanship and shows extremely fast reaction speed. She easily cut down several of Marisa's danmaku, and reacted with blinding speed to the witch's ''Final Spark'' laser. Furthermore, when Marisa used ''Double Spark'' against her, Yorihime was able to prepare herself and simulaneously summon Ishikori-dome no Mikoto before any of the two lasers reached her.&lt;ref&gt;[[Silent Sinner in Blue]] - Chapter 15&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of [[Symposium of Post-mysticism]], ZUN commented that Yorihime was too strong to be in a game, and he could only put her in a comic since in a game one should be able to defeat all the bosses.&lt;ref name="SoPM interview"&gt;[[Symposium of Post-mysticism/Interview]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, he referred to [[Hecatia Lapislazuli]], who was a boss in [[Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom]], as "completely past the level of anyone in [[Gensokyo]] or the [[Lunar Capital]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Strange Creators of Outer World/Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom interview with ZUN|Strange Creators of Outer World - Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom interview with ZUN]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Possessions===
Yorihime owns a sword and is extremely skilled at using it.

The chosen names for the Watatsuki Sisters make a direct reference to the family history of the Dragon God, who can be referred to alternatively as Ryujin or ‘Watatsumi’. Individually, the sisters may refer to the Dragon God’s daughters, [http://www.goddessaday.com/southeast-asian/toyotama-hime Toyotama-hime] and her younger sister Tamayori-hime. Considering the events that were revealed in [[Cage in Lunatic Runagate/Third Chapter|Chapter 3 of ''Cage in Lunatic Runagate'']], and that the Dragon Palace and the [[Lunar Capital]] are confirmed to be the the same place,&lt;ref name="SoPM interview"/&gt; it can be rumored that many of the legends about the Dragon Palace in fact took place on the Moon.

==Story==
;''Silent Sinner in Blue''
:{{Main|Silent Sinner in Blue}}

After being warned by [[Eirin Yagokoro|Eirin]] of the invasion, she intercepts and fights [[Reimu Hakurei|Reimu]], [[Marisa Kirisame|Marisa]], [[Sakuya Izayoi|Sakuya]], and [[Remilia Scarlet|Remilia]] after their spaceship crashes on the Moon. She defeats all four of them after only having just learned how the spellcard rules worked, though Reimu gave her a bit of trouble due to summoning Oomagatsumi and holding the moon hostage. Afterwards, she requests Reimu's help in clearing her of suspected treason.

;''Cage in Lunatic Runagate''
:{{Main|Cage in Lunatic Runagate}}
After reflecting on the baseless rumors of an upcoming Earth invasion, Toyohime and Yorihime briefly discuss the events 1500 years ago involving Eirin and Kaguya's descent to Earth. It also reveals Eirin as the person behind the old Japanese fable involving the Dragon King's Palace, ''Urashima Tarou'', which is on the moon rather than underwater, and how Toyohime came to give the protagonist of the tale refuge, and how Eirin is the one who orchestrated his return home, which would later cause him to be deified.

==Relationships==
;[[Watatsuki no Toyohime]] 
Her older sister, while somewhat aloof, she and Toyohime appear to hold their relationships in high regard.
;[[Eirin Yagokoro]] 
Distantly related to Eirin through marriage to their unnamed husbands (one of the Watatsuki sisters was the wife of Eirin's grandnephew, while the other one was married to their son&lt;ref name="CiLR1"&gt;[[Cage in Lunatic Runagate/First Chapter]]&lt;/ref&gt;), Eirin was also their teacher, whom they treat with much respect and admiration, despite Eirin being a fugitive.
;[[Reisen Udongein Inaba]] 
Her former pet.
;[[Reisen]] 
Her current pet. 
;[[Moon Capital Gate Guards]] 
They are the Gatekeepers of the Moon Capital.

==Additional Information==
*She and her sister are two of four characters so far known to be/to have been married. The others are [[Seiga Kaku]] and [[Junko]].
*Her ability to use a sword in combat is chiefly unknown due to her preference to summon gods, but she has enough skill/strength to block Marisa's Master Spark.
*Yorihime is one of the only characters in Touhou to have not been visibly defeated in a proper danmaku battle.
*Yorihime is with [[Flandre Scarlet]] and [[Koishi Komeiji]] a character being presumably more powerful than her older sister.

}}
This presumed-[[demon]] is the first stage midboss of ''[[Mystic Square]]'' character that appears on the road to [[Makai]]. Based on the story of the game, it's presumed that she's a resident of Makai. Once she appears on the screen, a electrified ring of some sort with four blue circles on it appears around her than starts spinning clockwise at a speed, where she starts attacked the heroines when [[danmaku]] will start spitting out as she orbit anti-clockwise around the screen. Once defeated, she drops an S power up item. She appears to be simply a stronger [[demon]] and that seems to be one of the many demons leaving [[Makai]]. Since she's got no dialogue with the player, nothing is known about it.

==Character Design==
===Name===
Like any other midboss, this character is nameless. Japanese fans will usually refer to her as {{nihongo|"MS 1st Stage Midboss"|怪綺談一面中ボス}}, while some of the western community would refer to her as "Hinamei". However, in relation to fan-names, various Japanese sources believe that this enemy, along with other [[demon]]ic [[stage enemies]], are in fact [[Fairy|fairies]]. Hence, [[pixiv]] refers to her as {{nihongo|"Wheel Fairy"|輪妖精|Wayousei}} (referencing the electric ring around her), while this wiki took the liberty of changing this to "Wheel Demon". The fact that there's no evidence of fairies mentioned in the game along with the game being based on demons disproves this.

===Design===
Her sprite shows that she's wears a red dress and blonde hair with a red ribbon. The sprite appears to be reused later on for general [[stage enemies]] on stages 5 and 6 with a lot of clones, suggesting to be a midboss turned common enemy, or that the midboss is just another mere enemy. However, stages 1 and 3 enemies of demons also resemble this midboss, with a difference of having a blue dress and having arms not stretched out. Excluding the red dress, she somewhat looks similar to [[Rumia]].

==Additional Information==
*She is the first midboss to share the sprite of a stage enemy, where the next to do this is the first stage midboss of ''[[Ten Desires]]'', which is a [[divine spirit]].

{{nihongo|'''Wriggle Nightbug'''|リグル・ナイトバグ|Riguru Naitobagu}} is a firefly with the ability to control other insects. She likes using her ability to direct concerted performances for her own amusement, as well as to attack humans who underestimate her significance or the importance of insects in general.

==General Information==
Wriggle first appeared as the first [[stage]] [[boss]] and midboss of ''[[Imperishable Night]]''. She's classified as a firefly [[youkai]], which is explained as having more survivability because [[human]]s are less likely to kill them. However, like other insects, she is weak to fire, cold, fumigation, and insect repellent. As an insect, she forgets about information that's no longer needed. She normally sticks around bushes, clumps of grass, and other places insects normally thrive.

===Personality===
Wriggle is quick to anger, and seems to take it personally when someone offends insects in any way. She is concerned about the decrease in the amount of insects lately, especially due to insecticide.

===Occupation===
At one point, Wriggle was in charge of an insect delivery service. However, during the span of time between [[Aya Shameimaru]]'s article and her interview, she stopped, and forgot all about it.

===Abilities===
;Ability to control insects
Wriggle possesses the ability to freely manipulate insects of most varieties, where it's unclear if this power is limited to only certain insects. She is seen manipulating various types of fireflies, as well as moths (which her spell card calls "butterflies"). While individual bugs may be quite weak, this ability can be used to call on entire swarms of them, including poisonous insects like deadly hornets; when she gets serious, she's also able to summon a swarm of harvest mites, insects so small that they are invisible to the naked eye and are the most dangerous bugs, that can bite without detection and infect [[human]]s with fatal diseases. In ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'', [[Hieda no Akyuu]] also describes her as being able to control caterpillars, spiders, crickets, and other insects, so it is likely the type of insect doesn't matter.

Because she often uses this ability to surround herself with bugs, many humans find it unpleasant to confront her. However, while this ability makes her a fearsome opponent for most humans, Wriggle herself is almost harmless, and confronting her while she is alone (i.e. winter, when there are no or few bugs around her) would lead to an easy victory. Moreover, since the insects she controls still have their typical weaknesses, such as cold, fire, fumigation and insecticide, one can greatly weaken her capabilities by exploiting one or more of these weaknesses.

==Character Design==
[[File:PMiSS wriggle.jpg|thumb|150px|Wriggle in ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]''.]]
===Name===
Her full name is {{nihongo|''Wriggle Nightbug''|リグル・ナイトバグ}}. "Wriggle" comes from the English word, which is commonly used to refer to bugs moving along the ground. "Nightbug" is a portmanteau of "night" and "bug"; the meaning is clear, as she is a firefly.

===Design===
Wriggle has blue eyes, teal hair, and bug-like antennae. She wears a white shirt with stylized short sleeves, a black cape with red lining, which is shaped to resemble insect wings (however, [[Hieda no Akyuu]] describes her as having actual wings), and baggy blue knee-length shorts.

According to Akyuu, she looks like an average human aside from the insect appendages, and her childlike appearance is a testament to the fact that insect [[youkai]] are no longer equal to [[oni]] and [[tengu]] in terms of inspiring fear.

==Appearances==
===Games===
;''Imperishable Night''
[[File:Th08WriggleSprite.png|frame|Wriggle's sprite in ''IN'']]
During the events of ''[[Imperishable Night]]'', Wriggle attacks the player characters, thinking they'd be easy targets. However, the pair fights Wriggle off without breaking a sweat.

===Spin-offs===
;''Shoot the Bullet''
[[File:Th135Wriggle.png|frame|Wriggle in ''HM'']]
In ''[[Shoot the Bullet]]'', [[Aya Shameimaru]] encountered Wriggle on [[stage]] 1 and took photos of her [[danmaku]].

;''Hopeless Masquerade''
Wriggle made a background cameo appearance in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'' on the [[Hall of Dreams' Great Mausoleum]] and [[Youkai Tanuki Forest]] stage. She is seen floating and cheering.

===Literature===
;''Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red''
:{{Main|Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red/Wriggle|l1=Article and Interview: Wriggle Nightbug}}''
In [[Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red]], Wriggle used her manipulation of insects in order to start an "Insects' News Service," which would send large numbers of bugs to make announcements and deliver messages for clients if they supplied plans and a specific time in advance. Wriggle organized the service with the intent of improving the social status of bugs, but soon got tired of it and stopped providing it.

When interviewed later, Wriggle does not remember the service, because insects discard information that is no longer in use.

{{nihongo|'''Yachie Kicchou'''|吉弔 八千慧|Kicchou Yachie}} is the stage 4 boss of [[Wily Beast and Weakest Creature]] and the leader of the Kiketsu Family, one of the major organizations of beast spirits that dominate the Animal Realm of hell. 

==General Information==

She first appeared as the midboss and boss of stage 4 of ''[[Wily Beast and Weakest Creature]]'' and is the leader of the otter spirits. Prior to the events of the game, she sent the beast spirits to the Human Realm to search for a human who could help against the haniwa army made by [[Keiki Haniyasushin]]. 

===Personality=== 

Though polite and amiable on the surface, Yachie is a manipulative and condescending individual underneath. She is willing to use underhanded methods to succeed in her goal, including eliminating potential inconveniences if necessary. &lt;ref&gt; ''[[Wily Beast and Weakest Creature]]'' Bad Endings &lt;/ref&gt; She views human and animal spirits as resources and believes that cooperation is impossible in the animal realm and that competition is the way to make progress&lt;ref name="KY"&gt; ''[[Wily Beast and Weakest Creature]]'' - ''"And that's why you don't belong here, Keiki. It's not just the humans. The beast spirits, too. We're all resources."'' (Ending no. 8) &lt;/ref&gt;.

===Abilities===
;Making people lose the will to fight back

Her ability's true power is never directly mentioned. But when she confronts the heroines, she used her power to make the heroines unable to resist her orders, which was shown when the heroines agreed to everything she said even though they have no understanding of what was happening. &lt;ref&gt; ''[[Wily Beast and Weakest Creature]]'' - [[Wily Beast and Weakest Creature/Story/Reimu's Scenario (Wolf)|Reimu's Scenario (Wolf)]] &lt;/ref&gt;

==Character Design==
===Origin===
Yachie is based on the ''Jidiao'' (吉弔), a Chinese Legendary creature said to have been seen in Guangzhou and Guangxi. The jidiao has the body of a tortoise with the head and tail of a dragon.

===Name===
Yachie's full name is ''Yachie Kicchou'' (吉弔 八千慧 Kicchou Yachie).  The first two characters in her name (八千 ''Yachi'') mean ''eight thousand'', and the third character (慧 ''e'') means ''wise'', which might refer to her manipulative nature.

Her surname "Kicchou" (吉弔) is taken directly from the Japanese pronunciation of "Jidiao". Those characters mean "good luck" and "funeral" respectively.

===Design=== 
Yachie is depicted with red eyes and blonde short hair with yellow antler-like horns. She wears a light blue shirt and a turquoise pleated skirt. She has a green scaly shell on her back, the scales extend to her long tail with segmented underside.

==Appearances==
[[File:Th17YachieSprite.png|frame|right|Yachie's sprite in ''[[Wily Beast and Weakest Creature|WBaWC]]'']]
===Games===
; [[Wily Beast and Weakest Creature]]
Yachie finds the heroines and she tell them that the enemy they are searching for is not in hell, but if they defeat her she will tell them where it is. After being defeated, she tells them that their objective is in the [[Animal Realm]] and exactly in the core of it. Furthermore, she tells them that if they defeat [[Keiki Haniyasushin|the enemy]], the invasion will end.

==Relationships==

===Keiki Haniyasushin===
Yachie views [[Keiki]] as a competition and therefore a worthy opponent for the sake of progress. However, she also sees Keiki as an old enemy to get rid of in the struggle for resources (in this case, human spirits). That said, they are familiar enough to talk amicably with each other whilst in a confrontation &lt;ref name="KY"/&gt; 

===Saki Kurokoma===
[[Saki]] gets along terribly with Yachie, referring to the dragon turtle as "foul" or "creepy"
&lt;ref&gt; ''[[Wily Beast and Weakest Creature]]'' - [[Wily Beast and Weakest Creature/Story/Reimu's Extra (Wolf)|Reimu's Extra (Wolf)]] &lt;/ref&gt;, but respects her strength. Yachie at least seems to respect the Keiga clan wolf spirits.

===Yuuma Toutetsu===
It is unknown how Yachie thinks about [[Yuuma]]. However, considering that the Kiketsu Family and the Gouyoku Family formed an alliance during the events of Wily Beast and Weakest Creature, it is believed that their relationship is neutral, if not bad.

==Additional Information==
*Yachie appears on [[Wily Beast and Weakest Creature]]'s jewel case, along with [[Keiki Haniyasushin]] and [[Saki Kurokoma]].
**Yachie, [[Mai Teireida]], and [[Satono Nishida]] are the only Windows-era non-final or extra bosses to appear in a game's jewel case.
***Among them, Yachie is the only stage 4 boss to have this distinction.
* In ''[[Unconnected Marketeers]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; files, the background of ''[[Wily Beast and Weakest Creature]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s ending 10 is present, where Yachie appears. This is likely an error from [[ZUN]], who maybe left it from ''WBaWC'' without realizing it.

　　畜生界、そこは究極の弱肉強食の世界。&lt;br&gt;
　　強い者が欲望のままに支配する世界……だった筈が、ちょっとだけずる賢い者が組織を構成するようになり、&lt;br&gt;
　　今では数組の巨大組織によって支配される世界になっていた。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

　　ほぼ全ての動物霊達は、すでに一匹では勝ち目がなく、何処かに組して永遠に奴隷として闘い続けるしか&lt;br&gt;
　　生き延びるすべの無い状況になっていた。&lt;br&gt;
　　皆が疲弊し続けても、止めることの出来ないのが組織である。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

　　脚力と牙、強靱な肉体が特徴の動物霊による組織、勁牙組（けいがぐみ）。&lt;br&gt;
　　土中、水中、暗闇等からの奇襲を得意とする動物の霊達の組織、鬼傑組（きけつぐみ）。&lt;br&gt;
　　空中や圧倒的な大きさで俯瞰視点で戦う動物霊の組織、剛欲同盟（ごうよくどうめい）。&lt;br&gt;
　　罠や毒、寄生、擬態、あらゆる卑怯な手段を得意とする動物霊達による正体不明の組織、等など。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

　　畜生界はこれら巨大畜生組織でシェアを奪い合っていた。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

　　そんな中に、全ての組織にこき使われている、完全なる奴隷がいた。&lt;br&gt;
　　力は弱いが手先が器用な生き物、霊長類──つまり人間の霊である。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

　　彼ら畜生組織の支配層は、万能奴隷である人間が絶えないように保護施設を作った。&lt;br&gt;
　　その保護施設、名前は霊長園である。&lt;br&gt;
　　抵抗するすべを持たない人間を、霊長園で鑑賞する時だけは、各組織が争いを忘れた。&lt;br&gt;
　　霊長園は、畜生界の平和的な娯楽施設でもあったのである。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

　　しかし、それが失敗だった。&lt;br&gt;
　　単体では非力な人間の霊を、一箇所に集めてしまった事が、破滅的組織を生み出す事とへと繋がってしまう。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;


　　人間の霊は無力な自分を呪い、神に祈った。&lt;br&gt;
　　神もそれにこたえ、人間に信仰すべき偶像を与えた。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

　　信仰の力は革命的であった。&lt;br&gt;
　　信仰心を持った人間霊は動物霊を恐れなくなった。&lt;br&gt;
　　本来我欲でしか活動できない畜生界で、利他の精神で活動できるようになった事が大きいのだろう。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

　　しかし本当に力を持ったのは人間霊ではなく、偶像だったのだ。&lt;br&gt;
　　人間霊は偶像の向こうにいる神性に帰依しているつもりが、偶像そのものを信仰するようになってしまう。&lt;br&gt;
　　その結果、偶像が人間を支配し始めるのは、自然の成り行きだった。&lt;br&gt;
　　霊長園は偶像に支配され、人間霊の地位は再び最下層へ落とされた。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

　　偶像に支配された霊長園は、最凶の暴走組織になってしまったのだ。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

　　偶像は霊長園を飛び出し、畜生界を支配し始めた。&lt;br&gt;
　　肉も霊も欲も持たない偶像達に、畜生達は手も足も出なかったのである。&lt;br&gt;
　　このままでは畜生界は偶像に支配されて、廃墟と化すだろう。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;


　　しかし畜生達も黙って支配されるのを待っている訳では無い。&lt;br&gt;
　　奇襲を得意とする鬼傑組が、起死回生をかけて打倒偶像作戦を打ち立てた。&lt;br&gt;
　　それが『地上の人間を巻き込んで、人間の手で霊長園を壊滅させる』作戦だった。&lt;br&gt;
　　動物には宗教を生み出すことが出来ないので、霊長園の偶像崇拝とは別の信仰心を持った人間をぶつけて、&lt;br&gt;
　　宗教戦争に持ち込もうという大胆な作戦である。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;


　　畜生界と地上の行き来は簡単ではなかった。&lt;br&gt;
　　しかし、畜生界と地獄は隣り合わせで、比較的行き来も簡単である。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

　　今、地獄も権力争いで混乱していて、地獄経由なら人間界に行くことが容易だった。&lt;br&gt;
　　動物霊達は、地獄経由で地上に行き、（あわよくば支配できても良いと思って）地上に攻め入るフリをして&lt;br&gt;
　　一芝居を打ったのだ。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;


　　彼女は畜生界に存在する四大組織の一つ、鬼傑組の組長である。&lt;br&gt;
　　人間界に動物霊を送り込み、使えそうな人間を探していた。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

　　誰にでも慇懃な態度をとるが、ほぼ全てを見下している。&lt;br&gt;
　　彼女に逆らえる奴はいない。

'''Stage 4 Boss'''&lt;br/&gt;
'''Matriarch of the Kiketsu Family'''&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Yachie Kicchou&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Species: Jidiao&lt;br/&gt;
Ability: Capable of making people lose the will to fight back&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The Animal Realm, the ultimate survival-of-the-fittest world.&lt;br&gt;
It's a world where the strong rule as they desire... or at least it ''was'', until a few beasts that were just a little more clever and wily than others began to form organizations.&lt;br&gt;
By now, a select handful of gigantic organizations dominate the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Almost all of the animal spirits already have no chance of victory by themselves, and the only way to survive was to team up with one of these organizations and continue fighting as their slaves forever.&lt;br&gt;
Even as everyone continues to fight to exhaustion, an organization can never be stopped.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The Keiga Family is an organization of beast spirits with excellent leg strength, fangs, and strong bodies&lt;br&gt;
The Kiketsu Family is an organization of beast spirits that excel at surprise attacks from the ground, the water, darkness, and so on.&lt;br&gt;
The Gouyoku Alliance is an organization of beast spirits that fight from the air or with overwhelming numbers, from a bird's-eye point of view.&lt;br&gt;
There's also an unidentified organization of beast spirits who excel in cowardly methods of fighting, such as traps, poisons, parasitism, camouflage, and so on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Within the Animal Realm, each of these enormous beast organizations competed for their share.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Meanwhile, there was one group of spirits that were complete slaves to all of these organizations.&lt;br&gt;
Creatures that were weak in power, but had extremely dexterous hands: ''homo sapiens''. In other words, human spirits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The beast organizations' ruling classes created a shelter for the humans, so that they could continue to be used as ever-capable slaves without going extinct.&lt;br&gt;
The shelter was called the Primate Spirit Garden.&lt;br&gt;
Only when they looked over the Primate Spirit Garden, filled with humans who had no means of resisting, did each of the organizations forget about their conflict.&lt;br&gt;
The Primate Spirit Garden was a peaceful recreational facility for everyone in the Animal Realm.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

But that was also their big mistake.&lt;br&gt;
The human spirits were powerless on their own, but collecting them all in one place soon led to the creation of a catastrophically destructive organization.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The human spirits cursed their powerless selves, and began praying to a god.&lt;br&gt;
That god responded by giving the humans idols to worship.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The power of faith was revolutionary.&lt;br&gt;
With their newfound faith, the human spirits no longer feared the beast spirits at all.&lt;br&gt;
Since acting out of anything but selfishness was previously impossible in the Animal Realm, perhaps their newfound ability to act in the spirit of altruism had a large effect on them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

However, it was actually the idols, not the human spirits, that had the power.&lt;br&gt;
The human spirits intended to devote themselves to the divinity beyond the idols, but they actually came to worship the idols themselves.&lt;br&gt;
As a result, it was only natural that these idols began to dominate the humans.&lt;br&gt;
The idols took control of the Primate Spirit Garden, and the status of the human spirits plummeted to the bottom once again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

In being dominated by idols, the Primate Spirit Garden became the most awful, out-of-control organization of all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The idols flew forth from the Primate Spirit Garden, and began to take over the Animal World.&lt;br&gt;
The idols had no flesh, soul or desire, and so the beasts were quite literally unable to lay a finger on them.&lt;br&gt;
At this rate, the Animal Realm would surely be ruled by the idols and fall into utter ruin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

But the beasts weren't simply sitting around and waiting to be dominated, either.&lt;br&gt;
The Kiketsu Family, which specialized in sneak attacks, brought things back from the brink by devising a strategy to overthrow the idols.&lt;br&gt;
Namely: ''"drag in a human from the surface, and destroy the Primate Spirit Garden with a human's own hands"''.&lt;br&gt;
Since the beasts were incapable of forming religions of their own, they would invoke a religious war by pitting the idols against a human whose faith was different from the Primate Spirit Garden's idolatry. A truly bold strategy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Getting to the surface world from the Animal Realm wasn't an easy task.&lt;br&gt;
However, the Animal Realm and Hell are right next door to each other, and are relatively easy to navigate between.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Because Hell was currently going through a power struggle of its own, it was easy to travel through it to get to the Human Realm.&lt;br&gt;
The beast spirits went to the surface via Hell, and put on a show of pretending to invade it (though if they actually succeeded in dominating it, that wouldn't have been half bad either).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Yachie is the head of the Kiketsu Family, one of the four major organizations in the Animal Realm.&lt;br&gt;
She sent the beast spirits to the Human Realm in search of a human who could be of use.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

She acts courteously towards everyone, but looks down on the vast majority of them.&lt;br&gt;
Nobody can resist her.

{{nihongo|'''Yamame Kurodani'''|黒谷 ヤマメ|Kurodani Yamame}} is the Stage 1 boss in ''[[Subterranean Animism]]'', inhabiting the entrance to the [[Underworld]].

==General Information==
Yamame is a [[tsuchigumo]] – an earth spider – with the ability to manipulate diseases. She first appeared as the Stage 1 boss in ''[[Subterranean Animism]]'', then as a stage 3 target in ''[[Double Spoiler]]'' and as a background character in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]''. She generally prefers not to use said ability, though, and she has an outgoing nature and a love of fighting. 

===Personality===
Other [[youkai]] like her for her bright personality, but humans stay away because of her ability. Furthermore, she doesn't want to attack humans if she could avoid it. In addition, as a tsuchigumo, she is well-suited for building construction due to her physical strength and that of her string. However, she can apparently be reasoned with.

===Abilities===
Yamame can fire out spider-like webs, where in ''[[Double Spoiler]]'', [[Aya Shameimaru]] commented that "[[tsuchigumo]] are quite skilled and strong, and particularly good with architecture".

;Manipulating illness (mainly infectious disease)
Yamame's ability is manipulation of illness and diseases, with a specialization in infectious ones. The amount of viruses and germs being quite strong, that they infect the atmosphere, and are highly lethal. It can be said to be a natural enemy to [[human]]s, who are based upon living in groups. However, with the sensibility of not unreasonably inflicting illness, she herself doesn't have that sort of intention of using it often at all; this is probably due to being tormented with the experience of having inflicted disease on attacking humans in the far past.

It is partially implied in ''Symposium of Post-mysticism'' that the main disease she manipulates is influenza, as the only identifiable common symptom is a high fever, and the symptoms themselves change from year to year. It is further implied by the footnote which says that the sickness is called different things each year and even given "types", such as Type A or Type B. As a side note, [[Eirin Yagokoro]] is apparently attempting to create a "miracle drug" to cure this specific disease.

==Character Design==
[[Image:ThGKYamame.png|right|200px|thumb|Yamame Kurodani in ''[[Symposium of Post-mysticism|SoPM]]'']]
===Name===
In an interview released in [[Cara☆Mel‎]], ZUN mentioned that he figured her name was particularly "spiderish", maybe because spiders are all about their eyes (''me'', in Japanese). This means that another possible interpretation for her name would be "Yamame" or "{{lang|ja|八ま目}}", which roughly translates as "Eight Eyes". Also see [[Tsuchigumo]].

The name "Kurodani" is written with characters that mean "black valley". Yamame may be written as "[[Wikipedia:ja:山女|山女]]" (lit. mountain girl), which refers to a mythical demon in Japanese folklore.

===Design===
In ''[[Subterranean Animism]]'''s official art, Yamame has brown eyes and blonde hair tied up in a bun with a ribbon. She wears a black and brown dress that's poofy under the waist, some black shoes with white socks, and a yellow ribbon tied around her lower body. The number of buttons on her outfit adds up to the total amouth of eight eyes a spider has. In her ''[[Touhou Gouyoku Ibun]]'' appearance, her sprite has what looks like four large, brown spider legs with yellow rings near the extremes, but her portrait art leaves it ambiguous as to whether they are spider legs, or just the loose strips of a ribbon that looks similar to spider legs.

==Appearances==
===Games===
;''Subterranean Animism''
[[File:Th11YamameSprite.png|frame|Yamame's sprite in ''SA'']]
During the events of ''[[Subterranean Animism]]'', she asks the heroine if she is in her way to the festival in the [[Underground]]. However, she attacks the player as she thinks the heroine is talking to herself or acting suspiciously, but she was defeated quickly.

===Spin-offs===
[[File:Th175YamameSprite.gif|thumb|frame|left|90px|Yamame's sprite in ''GI'']]
;''Double Spoiler''
[[File:Th135Yamame.png|frame|Yamame in ''HM'']]
In ''[[Double Spoiler]]'', Yamame used a few [[spell card]]s and had [[Aya Shameimaru]] and [[Hatate Himekaidou]] taking photos of her and her [[danmaku]].

;''Hopeless Masquerade''
Yamame made a background cameo appearance in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'' on the [[Palace of Earth Spirits]] stage. She is seen at the top of the screen upside-down.

;''Touhou Gouyoku Ibun''
Yamame appears in [[Marisa Kirisame]], [[Kanako Yasaka]] and [[Flandre Scarlet]] scenarios. In Marisa's, she appears thinking she had another prey to eat, just to see the magician attack her not knowing what exactly is going on. In Kanako's scenario, she attacks her because she wanted to ''eat a snake'' just to be beaten by the god; and in Flandre's she thinks the vampire is a kishin, something that annoyed Flandre and made attack her.

===Literature===
;''Symposium of Post-mysticism''
[[Byakuren Hijiri]] mentions that Yamame came to the surface at one point to try and enter the [[Myouren Temple]], but the monk denied her entrance as Yamame's reasons were essentially because she thinks the worried people that come to the temple look delicious.

A youkai that lives primarily in abandoned cities and deep in caves.&lt;br/&gt;
She has no qualms about fighting humans. She has a bright, combative personality.

Her power makes everyone she meets hate her. However, she herself wouldn't inflict
disease on someone without reason. She's a bright, fun-loving youkai if you get to
know her, so she's popular among the youkai that live underground.

{{nihongo|'''Yatsuhashi Tsukumo'''|九十九 八橋|Tsukumo Yatsuhashi}} is a tsukumogami, transformed from a [[Wikipedia:Koto (instrument)|koto]]. She is the younger sister of [[Benben Tsukumo]], though they are technically not blood related, and just became sentient at the same time.

==General Information==
Yatsuhashi appeared as the Stage 4 [[boss]] and midboss of ''[[Double Dealing Character]]'', as has also appeared as the very first boss of ''[[Impossible Spell Card]]'' on the first day, who then re-appears later on as a recurring boss on the fifth day. As a koto [[tsukumogami]], she carries a koto, and uses it in her attacks and [[spell card]]s.

===Personality===
Yatsuhashi plays the role of the reckless and hot-blooded little sister, in contrast with her more mature big sister. However, they both dream of a utopia where tools could move freely without the need of youkai or humans using them. &lt;ref name="PDDC"&gt; ''[[Double Dealing Character]]'' - Tsukumo Sisters’ Omake &lt;/ref&gt; 

In ''[[Double Dealing Character]]'', Yatsuhashi fights (verbally) with her sister Benben as to who'll get to attack the player and, depending on the shot type selected, she will fight the heroine or leave in search of another opponent (though it’s important to note that she was under the effects of the [[Miracle Mallet]] at the time).

After discovering that their power was limited by the mallet's magic, they become worried that they'll revert back to being simple tools once it runs out, but with the help of [[Raiko Horikawa]], they were able to discard their old bodies in favor of new ones, allowing them to maintain their existence as tsukumogami.

===Abilities===
;Making sounds and performing on her own
Tsukumo sisters' stated ability. It is not known what it means specifically, but it could be a reference that they were instruments which need an user to be played, and now as tsukumogamis they can make music and perform on their own.

==Backstory==
Both Benben and Yatsuhashi were once merely instruments used by others in the [[Outside World]], but eventually they came to [[Gensokyo]]. When the [[Miracle Mallet]] was used, its magical power flooded into them, and they both became [[tsukumogami]] at around the same time. However, they quickly learned where their power was coming from (the [[Shining Needle Castle]]) and decided to overthrow society as tools, like [[Seija Kijin]] did as well.

==Character Design==
===Name===
Her full name is {{nihongo|''Yatsuhashi Tsukumo''|九十九 八橋}}. Her family name is a short form of "[[tsukumogami]]" that was changed into different kanji, which can read as the number "99". Her personal name is derived from the most famous koto player in Japanese history, "[[Wikipedia:Yatsuhashi Kengyo|Kengyou Yatsuhashi]]" ({{lang|ja|八橋検校}}); Yatsuhashi is a family name, and "kengyou" is a rank of official servants who play instruments. The motif of hers might be derived from a tsukumogami of koto "Kotofurunushi" ({{lang|ja|琴古主}}).

===Design===
Yatsuhashi has short brown hair with a magenta headband with diagonal stripes on it. Her clothes consist of a white shirt, with lilac accents, a purple bow on the back of her waist, and a black skirt with a purple zigzag pattern at the bottom. She wears no shoes or socks.

==Appearances==
===Games===
;''Double Dealing Character''
[[File:Th14YatsuhashiSprite.png|frame|Yatsuhashi's sprite in ''DDC'']]
Both Benben and Yatsuhashi appear before the player character in Stage 4, though only one of them fights the player at a time. The fight the player gets is decided by which shot type they choose - if they opted to not take their weapon along, they face Benben as the mid-boss and Yatsuhashi later as the main boss' if they did take their weapon, it is vice-versa. At first, the two of them are under the impression that the heroine is looking to join their side, but it quickly turns violent. After being defeated, she points out the [[Shining Needle Castle]], which is where they're getting their power from.

Between the main game and the extra stage, they were approached by [[Raiko Horikawa]], who explained what had happened - and a way out of their situation. The two tsukumogami had realized that their power was coming from the Miracle Mallet. Not wanting to return to being tools, they successfully replaced the magical power they used to survive as self-aware beings with one from the outside world. The heroine must fight both of them at once.

===Spin-offs===
;''Impossible Spell Card''
Presumably from hearing or seeing a wanted sign about the mischief-making [[amanojaku]] [[Seija Kijin]], Yatsuhashi is the first of the many [[youkai]] that tries to capture her. She uses [[spell card]]s that are considered impossible to dodge, and is also the one that explained to Seija that everyone will use any mean necessary to defeat her.

==Relationships==
===Benben Tsukumo===
Yatsuhashi is [[Benben Tsukumo]]'s younger sister, and serves as a hot-headed, energetic counterpart to Benben's cool and collected demeanor. The two of them are both tsukumogami, so they are not technically related by blood; they call themselves sisters because they were both "born" at roughly the same time.

===Raiko Horikawa===
[[Raiko Horikawa]] is a drum tsukumogami that approached her and Benben, and offered to swap out their source of power.

===Minor Relationships===
;[[Seija Kijin]] &amp; [[Shinmyoumaru Sukuna]]
No dialogue is exchanged between these characters; when mentioned by the heroine, Seija appears to realize she's talking about tsukumogami, but no more than that. They all appear to share the same goal of overthrowing society.

Benben plays the part of the cool, grown-up older sister, and Yatsuhashi plays the part of the hot-blooded, reckless younger sister.&lt;br /&gt;
They're said to be sisters, but it's just because they became tsukumogami at the same time. They're not blood relatives.

They realized that the source of their power was the upside-down castle floating in the sky, and set their sights there.

Their goal was to conquer the world with their fellow tools. Social upheaval, in other words.&lt;br /&gt;
They dreamed of an utopia where tools could move freely, and display their abilities to the fullest.

However, that dream was prevented by Reimu and company.


They still didn't give up, though.&lt;br /&gt;
When they realized that their thoughts had been influenced by the Miracle Mallet's magic,&lt;br /&gt;
they tried using incantations to replace their power with a different magic power.

The {{nihongo|'''Yin-Yang Orb'''|陰陽玉|Onmyou-dama or Onmyou-gyoku}} is an orb with the appearance of a yin-yang symbol, used by [[Reimu Hakurei]]. Ever since ''[[Highly Responsive to Prayers]]'', they've been Reimu's prime weapon.

==General Information==
The Yin-Yang orbs have appeared in every game [[Reimu Hakurei]] has appeared in, from early [[PC-98]] to the latest [[Windows]] game. They appear next to her and are used in many of her attacks, either firing [[danmaku]] or being used as projectiles themselves.

*In the [[PC-98]] era, the Yin-Yang Orbs are stated to be the greatest treasure of the [[Hakurei Shrine]]; made with a wondrous type of crystal, they hold so much spiritual power that they seem like they could be alive. They are an extremely effective weapon against non-[[human]]s ([[youkai]]); in [[Highly Responsive to Prayers|the first game]] they are Reimu's only way of damaging enemies, due to her normal ofuda, spiritual techniques and martial arts being ineffective.&lt;ref name="HRtPmanual"&gt;''[[Highly Responsive to Prayers]]'': 靈異伝.TXT&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SoEWmanual"&gt;''[[Story of Eastern Wonderland]]'': 封魔録.TXT&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Story of Eastern Wonderland]]'', [[Mima]] explains that only a blood member of the Hakurei clan may use the orbs, of which Reimu is the last living member. The orbs work by slowly absorbing their user's energy, good or evil, until they can hold no more and all of it bursts forth at once, after which the process repeats itself.
*In the [[Windows]] era, Reimu continues to use the Yin-Yang Orbs as her main weapon, they were made by [[Misumaru Tamatsukuri]] and are made out of Izanagi Objects, both of which Reimu seemingly did not know. While temporarily deprived of her ofuda and needles, Reimu has referred to the orbs (and possibly her [[purification rod]]) as her "strongest weapons".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'' Chapter 27&lt;/ref&gt; It is dangerous for [[youkai]] to even touch the orbs, though [[fairy|fairies]] are unaffected.&lt;ref name="OSPgoshintai"&gt;''[[Oriental Sacred Place]]'' Chapter 17&lt;/ref&gt; Unknown to Reimu, the true source of their anti-youkai properties is [[The Hakurei God|the god of the Hakurei Shrine]], for whom they act as a [[wikipedia:goshintai|go-shintai]].&lt;ref name="OSPgoshintai" /&gt;

During the PC-98 era, it was treated as a type of [[character]], but this doesn't seem to be the case in the Windows era where it's seen as an object.

==Character Design==

===Name===
It's full name is the {{nihongo|''Yin-Yang Orb''|陰陽玉|Onmyou-dama or Onmyou-gyoku}}. The first two kanji {{nihongo||[[wiktionary:陰陽|陰陽]]|Onmyou}} mean "[[wikipedia:Yin and yang|yin and yang]]", with {{nihongo||[[wiktionary:陰|陰]]|on}} being the yin meaning "dark" and {{nihongo||[[wiktionary:陽|陽]]|you}} being the yang mean "light". The kanji {{nihongo||[[wiktionary:玉|玉]]|''Gyoku''}} literally means "Ball", "Sphere" or "Jade" (a green gem).

The Yin-Yang Orb appears to be a typical [[wikipedia:Taijitu|taijitu]] (yin-yang symbol) made of some type of crystal. Its true form is unknown.

In the good ending of ''[[Highly Responsive to Prayers]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; [[Makai]] route, the ball transformed into a tiny [[fairy]] with a white dress and pink hair. In the [[Hell]] route's good ending, the ball transformed into a strange creature resembling a white ball with stick-like legs and a top hat. This creature, called a "mountain-walker", appears in Izumi Takemoto's manga ''Loop Salada''. Izumi Takemoto is a manga artist whose works are referenced in various places in the ''[[Touhou Project]]''.

==The Yin-Yang Orbs' Appearances==
===PC-98===
;''Highly Responsive to Prayers''
[[File:Th01YinYangSprite.png|frame|Sprite of the Yin-Yang Orb in ''[[HRtP]]'']]
:{{Main|Highly Responsive to Prayers#Story|l1=Highly Responsive to Prayers Story}}
The [[Shrine Maiden]] [[Reimu Hakurei]] is able to frantically persuade a bouncing Yin-Yang orb to hit various on-screen targets, "cards" and "bosses" alike. The Yin-Yang Orb is her only true weapon against the powerful enemies, but she lacks the training to be able to fully control it. As such, she must avoid contact with it at all times; should the orb impact Reimu, she will be hit, and a life will be lost. However, Reimu can knock and manoeuvre the Yin-Yang Orb around by whacking it with her [[gohei]], slide-tackling it or firing an [[ofuda]] at it. Only the Yin-Yang orb can damage the enemies, so simply firing your shots at enemies will have no effect.

When the orb passes over a card in the field, the card is considered to be ''hit'' (though no actual collision occurs). In most cases, a single hit is enough to overturn a card and eliminate it from the field, though in later stages, occasional cards will require multiple hits to overturn. Additionally, when the orb impacts a boss's weak point, the boss takes damage and loses a single notch from its health bar. Furthermore, the orb can dispel small white bullets (but nothing greater) as it passes through them. 

In the endings to ''[[Highly Responsive to Prayers]]'', the Orb appears to transform into either a tiny wish-granting [[fairy]] or a joyful spherical creature. In [[Makai]] route good ending, Reimu thought the tiny fairy can grant wishes, so Reimu wished for money, a cake, a hot meal, "the truth of the Universe", and the "destruction of Earth", with a response from the fairy: "Who'd wish something like that!?" In the [[Hell]] route good ending, the joyful creature starts destroying parts of the [[Hakurei Shrine]] and Reimu gets angry.

;''Story of Eastern Wonderland''
:{{Main|Story of Eastern Wonderland/Story|l1=Story of Eastern Wonderland Story}}
Depending on which ending you get [[Genjii]] will explain the orb's "true power", each of which is hilariously mundane and is never spoken of again in the series:
#The ability to eat sweets and not get fat
#The effect of giving its user whatever scent they desire[[File:Th03YinYangBoss.png|frame|The Yin-Yang in ''[[PoDD]]'']]
#The ability to turn into a cat whenever the user chooses

;''Phantasmagoria of Dim.Dream''
In ''[[Phantasmagoria of Dim.Dream]]'', the orbs were for the first time treated as ordinary projectiles, used on the opponent's screen whenever Reimu summons an attack. If Reimu were to summon a Boss Attack, then unlike other characters who use their own body to be on the opponent's screen, the appearance of a giant Yin-Yang appears instead.

;Lotus Land Story
[[File:Th04Yin-YangOrb.png|frame|The Yin-Yang Orb in ''[[LLS]]'']]
Also used by Reimu when she's a playable character, the Yin-Yangs appear as ordinary [[danmaku]] on Stage 4, supporting Reimu during her boss fight as they bounce downwards towards Marisa.

===Windows===
;''Imperishable Night''
[[File:Th08YinYangSprite.png|frame|left]]
Also used by Reimu when she's a playable character, the Yin-Yangs appear as a generic enemy on Stage 4 just like they did on ''[[Lotus Land Story]]'', supporting Reimu during her boss fight as they bounce downwards towards the heroine; because they're destroyable, it wouldn't be best to treat them as [[danmaku]]. However, similar to other spirits throughout the game, if the player chooses to focus, then they'll become transparent, undefeatable, but also harmless, which simplifies gameplay.

;''Phantasmagoria of Flower View''
[[File:Th09YinYangSprite.png|frame]]
In ''[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]'', the Yin-Yangs weren't shown to be a default weapon for [[Reimu Hakurei]], but instead they appear as Reimu's Extra Attack. It was described as "Mysterious orbs bouncing off the boundaries." If Reimu were to kill a [[spirit]], then a black and white yin-yang will appear in the opponent's screen and bounce downwards from the top, being ordinary [[danmaku]]. However, they've doubled in size compared to their previous game's counterpart. If the player is using the alternative version of Reimu who uses a blue outfit, then her Yin-Yang Orbs will be aqua coloured.

;''Subterranean Animism''
:{{Main|Subterranean Animism/Story|l1=Subterranean Animism Story}}
In ''[[Subterranean Animism]]'', [[Yukari]] modified the Yin-Yang Orb to act as a communicator to stay in touch with the other youkai while Reimu went to [[Former Hell]].

;''Unconnected Marketeers''
:{{Main|Unconnected Marketeers/Story|l1=Unconnected Marketeers Story}}

In ''[[Unconnected Marketeers]]'', [[Misumaru]] reveals in Stage Four of Reimu's scenario that she was the original creator of the Yin-Yang Orbs, having made them out of similar materials to the dragon gems, and her spell cards include the use of multicolored Yin-Yang Orbs. 

;''Fighting games''

In the fighting games, the Yin-Yang orb appear in several of Reimu's attacks, both in Story Mode [[Spell Cards]] (for example ''Second Card "Yin-Yang Scattering"'' in ''[[Immaterial and Missing Power]]'' and ''Treasure Sign "Dancing Yin-Yang Orbs"'' in ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]'') and in Spell Cards and other attacks usable by the player (''Holy Relic "Yin-Yang Demon God Orb"'' in '' Immaterial and Missing Power'' and ''Scarlet Weather Rhapsody'', ''Treasure "Ying-Yang Asuka'i"'' and ''Yin-Yang Shot'' in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'', ''[[Urban Legend in Limbo]]'', and ''[[Antinomy of Common Flowers]]'').

===Literature===
;''Oriental Sacred Place''
[[File:OSPCH17YinYangOrb.jpg|thumb|100px|Yin-Yang orb in ''[[Oriental Sacred Place]]'']]
In ''[[Oriental Sacred Place]]'' Chapter 10, the Yin-Yang Orb is shown to still have its communicator function and was thrown onto the ground by Reimu in disgust at Yukari using it to eavesdrop on her.

Later in Chapter 17, the [[Three Fairies of Light]] decide to finally solve the mystery of the Hakurei Shrine once and for all. [[Kasen Ibaraki]] informs them that to start, they need to figure out who its god is and what the god's blessing was, and in order to do that, they need to find the shrine's go-shintai. However, because solving the mystery could disrupt the current golden situation with youkai and humans in [[Gensokyo]], Kasen uses her animal companions to trick the three fairies into finding three false go-shintai that she hid amongst the shrine (and wrote down "go-shintai" on the back of them just in case, though that turned out to be unnecessary). Later, Kasen finds a Yin-Yang Orb that the fairies dropped on the ground. The Yin-Yang Orb destroyed [[Kasen Ibaraki]]'s artificial arm when she touched it, revealing that the orbs were the real go-shintai of the shrine, and the shrine's blessing was youkai extermination. Kasen has an animal companion snake return it to the shrine.

===Seihou Games===
[[File:Sh01YinYang.png|frame|Sprites of the Yin Yang in ''[[Shuusou Gyoku]]'']]
{{seihou note|section}}
;''Shuusou Gyoku''
Being part of [[Reimu Hakurei]], the Yin Yang Orbs appear on the Extra stage of the first ''[[Seihou Project]]'' game ''[[Shuusou Gyoku]]'', a [[danmaku]] game series by the junior doujin circle "[[Shunsatsu sare do?]]", where [[ZUN]] also contributed music and art to the game and put them in the game. The Yin-Yang Orbs appeared as ordinary [[danmaku]], supporting Reimu during her boss fight as they bounce downwards towards [[VIVIT]] when Reimu shoots them, which is very similar to her battle in ''[[Lotus Land Story]]''.

==Relationships==
;[[Reimu Hakurei]]
Reimu Hakurei is able to control the Yin-Yang Orb. She uses the orb to exterminate both [[human]]s and [[youkai]] regardless if they're enemies. [[The Hakurei God]] uses the Orbs as its go-shintai, blessing youkai extermination through it.

;[[Misumaru Tamatsukuri]]
In ''Unconnected Marketeers'', it is revealed by Misumaru herself that she crafted the Hakurei Ying-Yang orbs.

===Minor Relationships===
;[[Genjii]]
Genjii is said to have relations with the Orb; this is unknown.

;[[Mima]]
Mima is said to have relations with the Orb; this is unknown.

==Additional Information==
*None of the [[Windows]] games have a portrait of the Yin-Yang Orb (including ''[[Phantasmagoria of Dim.Dream]]''); it can only be seen by sprite next to Reimu, a shield use in the fighter spin-offs, and as danmaku bullets. Even large sized Yin-yang bullets are classified.
*There are many objects that have a strong resemblance to the Yin-Yang Orb, including the [[flying yin-yangs]], the [[Shrine Tank]] with a small symbol, the [[Flower-Tank]], the [[Blood-Vessel Yin-Yang Orbs‎]] and the [[cannon]]s seen on stage one of ''[[Story of Eastern Wonderland]]''. Even [[Gyoku]] from the ''[[Seihou Project]]'' has a strong resemblance to the Yin-Yang Orb, where Gyoku may've been inspired by the Yin-Yang Orbs.

{{nihongo|'''Yoshika Miyako'''|宮古 芳香|Miyako Yoshika}} is a [[Jiang Shi]] who is of an ancient era of Japan who was revived by [[Seiga Kaku]] to be the guard of [[Hall of Dreams' Great Mausoleum]].

==General Information==
Yoshika first appeared as the stage 3 [[boss]] of ''[[Ten Desires]]'' and as an assistant of Seiga on the stage 4 boss battle, and performed attacks with her along with the title "Loyal Undead." She appeared in the background of ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'' and was a 4th Day Boss in ''[[Impossible Spell Card]]''.

In order to not decompose like normal [[Jiang Shi]] do, she has an anti-decomposition spell placed on her. She has no sense or self, and does not know pain or fatigue, which allows her to bring out all possible physical strength and creates great difficulty to encounter. She usually attacks people for no particular reason, but is easy to run away from. However, she is set to have a particular amount of health and even when defeated, she immediately recovers a few seconds later as shown Stage 4 of ''[[Ten Desires]]''.

===Personality===
According to ''[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]]'', she doesn't have much of a personality as a jiang shi, but whenever she is not under Seiga's control she does seem to revert back to the personality she had when she was alive. She has been seen reciting poetry while staring into empty space. Her thinking patterns are like a forgotten age of computers. Even regarding conversations with the main character, she forgot that she had a mistress, and did not remember what she was protecting, and is therefore a considerably problematic way of thinking.

===Occupation===
Prior to the events of ''[[Ten Desires]]'', Yoshika is Seiga's faithful servant who guards the [[Hall of Dreams' Great Mausoleum]]. Her current activities are unknown.

===Abilities===
;Eating anything
As literally stated. When she's hurt, she can suck in the surrounding [[divine spirit]]s and eat them to increases her HP back to full, thus furnishing her with an ability to "''recover her HP''". If this is ignored, then it wouldn't be possible to defeat her [[spell card]]s, as time would run out. This could be why [[Kogasa Tatara]] wasn't able to win against her during ''[[Ten Desires]]''.

Jiang shi seek out lifeblood and walk around aimlessly, and also has the characteristic of turning opponents into jiang shi upon bite. Yoshika also turns the living into jiang shi, and has a proactive attitude about increasing her companions. This behaviour may be due to a command, or it may be an instinctual behaviour of jiang shi.

===Species===
Since she's a [[Jiang Shi]], her body is unusually stiff, and her joints cannot twist, and therefore she cannot walk straight. Seiga, in order to protect from injury, seems to recommend [[w:Calisthenics|calisthenics]] to her.

==Character Design==
[[File:ThGKSeiga.png|thumb|right|200px|Yoshika with [[Seiga Kaku]] in ''[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]]''.]]
===Origin===
[[ZUN]] stated in an interview that her original design was too similar to [[w:Hsien-Ko|Lei-Lei (Hsien-Ko)]] from [[wikipedia:Darkstalkers|Darkstalkers]]. Considering it too cliché, he instead made Yoshika a zombie whose brain was rotting away and was thus stupid.

===Name===
Her full name is {{nihongo||宮古 芳香|Yoshika Miyako}}. The {{nihongo||宮古|Miyako}} in her name means "ancient palace", while {{nihongo||芳香|Yoshika}} means "fragrance", "perfume" if read together. The {{nihongo||芳|Yoshi}} can also mean "fragrance", "beautiful", "virtuous" when standing alone, and {{nihongo||香|ka}} "incense", which might be referring to either Yoshika being a jiang shi, or her guarding a graveyard.

Her name comes from {{nihongo|Miyako no Yoshika|[[wikipedia:ja:都良香|都良香]]}}, a ninth century Japanese scholar and poet. Legends say that 100 years after he left office, he was spotted on a mountain as a [[hermit]], his face unchanged.

===Design===
In ''[[Ten Desires]]'''s official art, Yoshika has pale skin, dark blue hair and eyes. She wears a blue hat with a yellow star and an [[Ofuda|ofuda]] on the forehead, which apparently has a to-do list written on it by her master. She wears a red Chinese-styled shirt with a pink trim on the wide sleeves, and a black skirt with the same trim wrapped around it like a ribbon. She keeps her arms ahead, like a zombie.

==Appearances==
===Games===
;''Ten Desires''
[[File:Th13YoshikaSprite.png|frame|Yoshika's sprite in ''TD'']]
When the heroine reaches the graveyard adjacent to the [[Myouren Temple]], Yoshika meets her there. Having been revived to protect the Mausoleum from intruders, a fact which takes her a little while to remember, she does battle with the heroine and loses. Later, in stage 4, she is revived again and returns to team up with her master [[Seiga Kaku]], but the two were defeated.

===Spin-offs===
;''Hopeless Masquerade''
[[File:Th135Yoshika.png|frame|Yoshika in ''HM'']]
Yoshika made a background cameo appearance in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'' on the [[Hall of Dreams' Great Mausoleum]] stage. She is seen standing on the mausoleum watching the many fights.

;''Impossible Spell Card''
Presumably from hearing or seeing a wanted sign about the mischief-making [[amanojaku]] [[Seija Kijin]], Yoshika appears to be one of the many [[youkai]] that tries to capture her. She uses [[spell card]]s that are considered impossible to dodge. Not only did she try to capture her independently, she was also controlled by her master on one spell card. 

===Literature===
[[File:ThGK Bunbunmaru2.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Yoshika with [[Rin Kaenbyou]] in ''[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]].'']]
;''Symposium of Post-mysticism''
:{{Main|Symposium of Post-mysticism/Bunbunmaru Newspaper 2|l1=Symposium of Post-mysticism: Speaking for the Mysterious Zombie}}
Humans that visited the graveyard started getting worried, as Yoshika had appeared there and was driving everyone away. They bring in [[Rin Kaenbyou]] to communicate with her and through a translator, she claims she isn't particularly intent on harming anyone, but just feels she has to defend the graveyard no matter what.

==Relationships==
===People in [[Senkai]]===
Yoshika is a corpse reanimated by [[Seiga Kaku]] in order to protect the [[Hall of Dreams' Great Mausoleum]] during [[Toyosatomimi no Miko]]'s resurrection. Seiga is generally a master who treats her like a tool, but also thinks she's a cute underling who's rotten, and even in battle, she can be seen diligently reviving Yoshika.

[[Toyosatomimi no Miko]] is a fellow ally of the [[Hall of Dreams' Great Mausoleum]] and the purpose of guarding it under Seiga Kaku's orders. [[Mononobe no Futo]] and [[Soga no Tojiko]] are also fellow allies. However, no actual relationship between these three are established.

===Minor Relationships===
;People in the Myouren Temple
Yoshika Miyako purpose for guarding the Hall of Dreams' Great Mausoleum was to prevent [[Byakuren Hijiri]] and the rest of her allies of [[Myouren Temple]] from interfering with Toyosatomimi no Miko's resurrection. Also, Yoshika's presence in the cemetery becomes an unknown threat for [[Kogasa Tatara]].

;[[Rin Kaenbyou]]
Rin is brought in to the graveyard to communicate with her and find out her intentions during the events of an article in ''Symposium of Post-mysticism''.

==Additional Information==
*She has a star on her hat that is similar to [[Hong Meiling]]'s, but without a symbol.
*The relationship between Yoshika and Seiga probably is caused from the fact that the inspirations of both of them appears in [[Wikipedia:Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio|Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio]]. There is a story "dead body incident" ({{zh|s=尸变|t=屍變}}), the 7th chapter of the 13th volume.
*According to legends, [[wikipedia:ja:茨木童子|Ibaraki-douji]], model of [[Kasen Ibaraki]], was an admirer of Miyako no Yoshika's works and even co-authored one of his poems: Yoshika improvised the first half of the poem while admiring the springtime scenery near the Rajoumon gate where Ibaraki dwelt, and the oni replied with the latter half.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mori |first1=Masato |date=1982 |title=Konjaku Monogatari-shū |url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/30233945 |journal=Japanese Journal of Religious Studies |volume=9 |issue=2/3 |pages= 151-152 |access-date=June 23, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Kasen is seen reciting this poem in the first chapter of ''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]''. 
*Yoshika is currently the only character in the whole series who can heal herself during a battle.

'''Yoshika Miyako'''

Species: Jiang shi&lt;br /&gt;
Ability: Eating anything&lt;br /&gt;
(humans bitten by her turn into a jiang shi temporarily)


A mysterious corpse revived by somebody. She is just a puppet, but she is keeping something important.

She possesses strange power and has a body that does not feel pain. It is very challenging to confront her directly, but her brain is like a forgotten age of computers. It is very easy to kite her around.

While fighting, if she is damaged, she consumes spirits and regenerates health, so she's very hard to beat up. But it is very easy to get away from her (and this is important).


Her flesh body is very hard, and her joints do not bend.  She cannot even walk that well. Her master is recommending calisthenics for her. Activity with no flexibility often ends up in injury. Though she is just a zombie.


What is it that she is keeping safe? And what of her master, who employed a meaningless bodyguard like her?


Stay tuned for the retail version!

'''Yoshika Miyako'''

Species: ''Jiang shi''.&lt;br /&gt;
Ability: The ability to eat anything.&lt;br /&gt;
(Humans bitten by her temporarily become ''jiang shi'' as well.)

A dead body from ancient Japan, reanimated by Seiga, for whom she works as an underling. This time, she was summoned to protect the Hall of Dreams' Great Mausoleum during the verge of resurrection. &lt;!-- check translation --&gt;

With strange powers and a body that feels no pain, she is a formidable enemy when faced head-on, but her cerebral faculties are on par the computational power of an obsolete computer, so escaping from her is a simple task.

When wounded in battle, she restores her strength by devouring spirits. She is not easily defeated, but &lt;u&gt;escaping from her is a simple task&lt;/u&gt;. (Take note of this!)

Her body is very stiff, and her joints do not flex. She can't even walk straight. Her master has recommended various stretches to her. Engaging in physical activity without stretching first may lead to injury—even if you're a zombie.

{{nihongo|'''Youki Konpaku'''|魂魄　妖忌|Konpaku Youki}} is an enigmatic character who has yet to make an actual appearance in any Touhou game. He was the first gardener for the Saigyouji clan at [[Hakugyokurou]] for about 300 years, before leaving it to his successor and student [[Youmu Konpaku]]. He, too, is a [[half-human half-phantom]]. No one currently knows his whereabouts.

==General Information==
===Personality===
Youki is described as stubborn, prideful and intimidating. While teaching, he preferred not to rely on words; when he did speak, he would only say few words with a thundering voice.

==Background Information==
===Name===
{{nihongo||魂魄妖忌|Youki Konpaku}} is his full name. {{nihongo||妖忌|Youki}} consists of two kanji: {{nihongo||妖|You}} as in "abnormal" or "supernatural", the same kanji found in "youkai", and {{nihongo||忌|Ki}} which mean "inauspicious" or "mourning". The characters for {{nihongo||魂魄|Konpaku}} mean simply "Soul". Although both {{nihongo||魂|Kon}} and {{nihongo||魄|Paku}} are "soul", their elements are different. ''Kon'' stands for a "mental soul", which is separated from a body as soon as human dies and ascends to the afterlife; ''Paku'' is a "physical soul", which remains in the body a few days and goes back to the Earth. In this case, ''Kon'' is Youki's phantom half, and ''Paku'' is his human half. Maybe ''Konpaku'' is not only a surname but a feature of the Konpaku clan.

==Backstory==
Youki was the former gardener of [[Hakugyokurou]]. After 300 years of service he left and went into seclusion, possibly because of his advancing age. Nothing is known about his whereabouts or activities after this.

==Relationships==
===[[Youmu Konpaku]]=== 
Youmu is Youki's student, and successor as gardener of [[Hakugyokurou]]. She believes that his disappearance is some kind of lesson from him.

===[[Yuyuko Saigyouji]]=== 
Youki served Yuyuko until his disappearance, though she found him harder to rely on than Youmu. Before the events of ''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]'' he was one of the few people aware of Yuyuko's connection to the [[Saigyou Ayakashi]].

==Additional Information==
*According to [[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Youmu Konpaku|Youmu]]'s article in ''Perfect Memento in Strict Sense'', the Konpaku are a lineage of half-human, half-phantoms.
*He is stated to be the only person who knows the whole story behind the sealing of the [[Saigyou Ayakashi]] in Yuyuko's profile. Yukari's profile shows she at least knows the part where Yuyuko is the one sealing it, so maybe the context is Youki is the only human to know. Presumably the story was passed down to him, just as he feels that Youmu will inherit it someday, as it seems unlikely Youki was alive when the Saigyou Ayakashi was sealed 1,000 years ago (but this is unconfirmed). The sealing of the Saigyou Ayakashi eventually became public knowledge on [[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Yuyuko Saigyouji|Yuyuko]]'s article in ''Perfect Memento in Strict Sense''.
*According [[ZUN]]'s memo, Youki's swordmanship style is comprised of stolen arts.

Youki Konpaku, the former gardener, had been the one for about 300 years, but suddenly became a hermit after having made a very young Youmu his successor. Youmu's ability of swordsmanship has still been in progress, so she needs daily practice. Though Youmu herself has no clue where her master is, she thinks of her master's absence as a lesson from him.

　　幽 々子が転生も消滅もせずに楼中に留まっているのも、西行妖の封印があるためである。この結界が解けたとたん、止まっていた時間は止め処なく流れることにな り、それは、再び幽々子の死に繋がる。自分を復活させることも白玉楼にいる自分の消滅にも繋がる為、復活は寸前で失敗するのは当然である。
 
　　やはり幽々子は死を操ることしか出来ないのだ。
 
　　唯一そのことを知る先代魂魄妖忌は、半分人間という性質上ゆっくり年を取り、妖夢に幽々子の事を伝えたつもりで消えた。

The reason Yuyuko can neither reincarnate nor vanish is because of the seal on the Saigyou Ayakashi. Once the boundary is breached, the time that was frozen will continue to flow, resulting in her death again. Reviving the corpse will destroy Yuyuko's ghost, so it's no wonder that the near-success of the revival ended in inevitable failure.
 
Yuyuko is only able to bring death after all. 

The only person who knew the whole story, Youki Konpaku, grew slowly older due to the nature of half-humans, and disappeared with the belief that Youmu could inherit the truth about Yuyuko.

{{nihongo|'''Youmu Konpaku'''|魂魄　妖夢|Konpaku Youmu}} is a half-[[human]] half-[[phantom]] who lives at [[Hakugyokurou]] in the [[Netherworld]] as a gardener and swordplay instructor, who also serves for [[Yuyuko Saigyouji]]. She first appeared as the [[Stage]] 5 [[boss]] of ''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]'', the seventh installment of the ''[[Touhou Project]]'', and has since become a recurring playable character.

==General Information==
[[File:GoMIllus-Youmu.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Youmu, as illustrated in the ''[[Grimoire of Marisa]]''.]]
In ''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]'', she gathered all of [[Gensokyo]]'s spring at Yuyuko's instruction, which was the reason Gensokyo's winter did not end. In ''[[Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red]]'' and Chapter 13 of ''[[Curiosities of Lotus Asia]]'', she took on the responsibility for collecting and returning the [[phantom]]s that wandered around Gensokyo as a result of the [[boundary]] of the Netherworld being thinned.

===Personality===
As she has a straightforward diligent personality, she is often manipulated by those around her (especially Yuyuko).&lt;ref name="INManual"&gt;[[Imperishable Night]]: Manual&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Immaterial and Missing Power]]: Shanghai Alice Communications.txt&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, she often fails at her task, but that does not mean that she has no real power, and she particularly excels at instantaneous force and concentration power.&lt;ref&gt;[[Shanghai Alice Correspondence Three Fairies Version/Volume 7]]&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Immaterial and Missing Power'', as literally stated by the shishou, "truth-slashing is something which you know", so she often performs [[wikipedia:tsujigiri|tsujigiri]]-like moves, but [[Suika Ibuki]] pointed out that she does not think that Youmu understood her shishou's teachings.

She has strong sensitivity, and in the good ending of ''Imperishable Night'', her human half was unable to resist the insanity-inducing effects of the true [[Moon]], causing her to become "half-insane". Ironically enough, considering her species, she is afraid of ghost stories, dares, and darkness, but she is calm around phantoms since she is half phantom herself.&lt;ref&gt;[[Imperishable Night]] [[Imperishable Night/Afterword|omake.txt]], [[Strange and Bright Nature Deity]] chapter 2, [[Oriental Sacred Place]] chapters 3-4, [[Cage in Lunatic Runagate]] [[Cage in Lunatic Runagate/Seventh Chapter|chapter 7]]&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Imperishable Night]]'''s [[Imperishable Night/Story/Ghost Team's Extra|Extra]], after defeating [[Fujiwara no Mokou]], Yuyuko pretends there is a ghost under a tree, earning a terrified shriek from Youmu. Much further on in ''[[Ten Desires]]'', as a result of being mistaken as a [[hermit]], she temporarily mistook herself as being a hermit.&lt;ref name="th13_ed08"/&gt; Due to artworks and her sprite in the fighting spin-offs, Youmu may be [[Wiktionary:ambidextrous|ambidextrous]].

===Abilities===
;Handling Sword Techniques
Youmu is a swordswoman who dual-wields two special swords, Roukanken and Hakurouken. As a result of Youki's disappearance, Youmu's sword training is incomplete. However, despite her unfinished training, Youmu is extraordinarily skilled in swordsmanship, as she can consistently win spellcard duels which are meant to be long-ranged with just her skills. Youmu can perform a constant barrage of flying slashes as danmaku, and is also extremely fast which helps her close in on opponents and deliver a flurry of slashes faster than the eye can see.

===Occupation===
As a gardener in the service of the Saigyouji family and the bodyguard of Yuyuko Saigyouji, Youmu is a swordswoman of a two-sword school of swordplay.

According to the Saigyouji family, Youmu is the second generation to take her position, the former generation being [[Youki Konpaku]]. Youki was Youmu's swordplay instructor. Youmu is also Yuyuko's sword instructor, but she is fundamentally treated as a gardener.&lt;ref name="INManual" /&gt;

===Possessions===
;[[Roukanken and Hakurouken]]
The [[wikipedia:katana|katana]] carried from her left shoulder to her waist on the right side, is {{nihongo||観楼剣|[[Roukanken]]| "watchtower sword"}}. It has been claimed to have been forged by [[youkai]], and has the power to kill ten phantoms in one slice.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]'' - 5th stage's dialog, "[[Immaterial and Missing Power/Afterword|Shanghai Alice Correspondence Vol.5]]" in ''[[Immaterial and Missing Power]]'', ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'' pp.22-24。&lt;/ref&gt; The shorter sword on her left waist is a [[wikipedia:wakizashi|wakizashi]] named {{nihongo||白楼剣|[[Hakurouken]]| "blank tower sword"}}, which seems to be the heirloom of the Konpaku family, and can slice through people's confusion.&lt;ref name="PMiSSYoumu" /&gt;

===Species===
She belongs to the subspecies of phantoms called the {{nihongo|"[[half-human half-phantom]]s"|半人半霊|"hannin hanrei" or "hanjin hanrei"}}. Half-human half-phantoms are the {{nihongo|mixed-race of phantoms and humans|幽霊と人間のハーフ}}, which have a largish phantom accompanying them and a relativity long life span compared to humans. The phantom that always follows them is called the {{nihongo|"half-phantom"|半霊&lt;ref name="th13_ed08"&gt; Youmu's Parallel Ending in ''Ten Desires''&lt;/ref&gt;、半幽霊&lt;ref name="INManual"&gt;[[Imperishable Night]]: Manual&lt;/ref&gt;|hanrei, hanyuurei}}, and they are the other half of their body.&lt;ref&gt;According to the ZUN's comment in the 2nd [[THWiki Popularity Poll]] ([http://thwiki.info/th/vote/result_char2.html#5 {{lang|ja|「第2回東方シリーズ人気投票」（2003年9月開催）キャラ部門・魂魄妖夢 におけるZUNの投稿]}})&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Perfect Memento in Strict Sense'', it was supposed that Youmu's human half manipulates the phantom half consciously. Youmu's human half has a lower body temperature compared to normal humans, and her phantom half's body temperature is not so cold compared to normal phantoms. In the ''[[Imperishable Night]]'' manual, it was written, "she has two kinds of body: human and phantom," showing Youmu to be "human" and the phantom to be "phantom."

Half-human half-phantoms are long-lived,&lt;ref name="PMiSSYoumu"&gt;[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]: [[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Youmu Konpaku|Youmu]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="th08_txt"&gt;[[Imperishable Night]]: Character setting.txt&lt;/ref&gt; but in ''[[Seasonal Dream Vision]]'', since it has still not been 60 years since the time she was born, in ''[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]'', she was not very knowledgeable about the "flower incident that occurs once every 60 years."&lt;ref&gt;[[Seasonal Dream Vision/A Beautiful Flower Blooming Violet Every Sixty Years]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character Design==
[[File:PMiSS youmu.jpg|thumb|200px|Youmu's depiction in ''[[PMiSS]]'']]
===Name===
Her full name is {{nihongo|''Youmu Konpaku''|魂魄　妖夢}}. The characters for {{nihongo||魂魄|Konpaku}} means "soul" and {{nihongo||妖夢|Youmu}} probably means "ghostly dream" in the context regarding her characteristic. Bear in mind that the "n" is an "m" sound; this is because it flows more smoothly in Japanese when it's before a "p" sound.

Although both {{nihongo||魂|kon}} and {{nihongo||魄|paku}} means "soul", their elements are different. ''Kon'' stands for a "mental" soul, which is separated from a body as soon as [[human]] dies and ascends to [[Heaven]]; ''paku'' is a "physical" soul, which remains in the body a few days and goes back to the Earth. In this case, ''kon'' is Youmu's ghostly half, and ''paku'' is the human half. The entire Konpaku family is comprised of half-phantom half-humans.&lt;ref name="PMiSSYoumu" /&gt;

The kanji that makes up {{nihongo||妖夢|Youmu}} are also part of the kanji for {{nihongo|''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]''|東方'''妖'''々'''夢'''|Touhou '''you'''you'''mu'''}}.

In ''[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]'', Youmu's name is written in [[Wikipedia:Romanization of Japanese|romaji]], with her surname first, during pre-battle conversation with her, even though every other character in the game with a Japanese name has their name Romanized western-style, with their first names first. This is one of several typographical inconsistencies in the game (another being the inconsistent spelling of [[Aya Shameimaru]]'s name).

===Design===
[[File:CoLAYoumuphantomhalf.jpg|thumb|200px|Youmu's phantom body acting in the same way as her human body in ''[[Curiosities of Lotus Asia]]'']]
Youmu has short silver hair and blue eyes. Her eyes were red in ''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]'' and her last word portrait in ''[[Imperishable Night]]''. Youmu's outfit generally consists of a aquamarine vest and skirt over a white undershirt with several ghost insignias along the edges of the skirt and one on the breast pocket of her vest. She wears a black bowtie and hairband with black ribbon tied off-center in her hair. She carries the [[Roukanken]]; a long katana with a large white tassel on the handle and the [[Hakurouken]]; a wakizashi (Short Japanese sword). Her ghostly half is a white phantom as large as her human self, sometimes referred to as ''[[myon]]'' by the fandom.

Youmu has slight design alterations in each of her appearances. Her hair became white and her eyes became blue in ''[[Immaterial and Missing Power]]''. In ''[[Ten Desires]]'', her hair becomes messier and her eyes are silver-colored. In ''[[Wily Beast and Weakest Creature]]'', Her insignias are different and her phantom half gains a snake-like head. In all game appearances after Perfect Cherry Blossom, her sleeves are short.

Her swords has also changed in appearance, In ''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]'', the Roukanken had a cherry blossom insignia and a flower attached to it, The insignia is missing in all later game appearance except ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]''. In ''[[Wily Beast and Weakest Creature]]'', the Roukanken gains a standard katana handle with red light particles along the blade and the hakurouken has a blue handle and has small souls along its blade.

According to ZUN, her height is "fairly short."&lt;ref name="mail"&gt;[[ZUN's E-mails]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearances==
===Games===
;''Perfect Cherry Blossom''
[[File:Th07YoumuSprite.png|frame|Youmu's sprite in ''PCB'']]
During the events of ''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]'', Youmu was ordered by [[Yuyuko Saigyouji]] to gather as much spring essence from [[Gensokyo]] as she could in order to get the entire cherry blossom garden, including the legendary [[Saigyou Ayakashi]], to bloom perfectly. Youmu's efforts indirectly caused winter to prolong in Gensokyo, prompting the player to hunt her down. Youmu tried to prevent the player from reaching [[Hakugyokurou]], but was defeated. She also tried to stop the player's confrontation against Yuyuko, but was once again defeated.
:{{Main|Perfect Cherry Blossom/Story/Reimu's Scenario#Stage 5|l1=Reimu Arc}}
In [[Reimu]]'s scenario, Youmu attacks the player after Reimu makes fun of her and ignores her advice.
:{{Main|Perfect Cherry Blossom/Story/Marisa's Scenario#Stage 5|l1=Marisa Arc}}
In [[Marisa]]'s scenario, Marisa tells Youmu about her wishes to take advantage of the warm spring weather to assist with a cherry blossom party. Youmu then demands that Marisa give her the spring she gathered, but Marisa declines.
:{{Main|Perfect Cherry Blossom/Story/Sakuya's Scenario#Stage 5|l1=Sakuya Arc}}
In [[Sakuya]]'s scenario, Sakuya complains about the length of the journey and impatiently asks Youmu to give back the spring. This irritates Youmu and causes her to attack.

;''Imperishable Night''
[[File:Th08YoumuBackSprite.png|frame|left|Youmu's back sprite in ''IN'']]
[[File:Th08YoumuSprite.png|frame|Youmu's sprite in ''IN'']]
:{{Main|Imperishable Night/Story/Ghost Team's Scenario 1|l1=Imperishable Night Ghost Team's Scenario 1}}
In ''[[Imperishable Night]]'', Youmu travels to the world of the living with the intent to solve the incident--although Yuyuko is more interested in having a feasting tour with a "dragon dish" as the crowning attraction.

;''Phantasmagoria of Flower View''
[[File:Th09YoumuBackSprite.png|frame|left|Youmu's back sprite in ''PoFV'']]
:{{Main|Phantasmagoria of Flower View/Story#Youmu's Story|l1=Phantasmagoria of Flower View Story}}
In ''[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]'', Youmu tries to mind her own business but continuously encounters various enemies barging into [[Hakugyokurou]] suspecting her as the flower incident culprit. When she travels to [[Gensokyo]] to investigate, she begins to form a conclusion but only realizes it fully when [[Aya Shameimaru]] points it out. Realizing that the incident was caused by an overabundance of spirits possessing the flowers, Youmu cut down some spirits to reduce their numbers a bit. This leads her into confrontation with [[Komachi Onozuka]], who tells her she should not be cutting down spirits while in the world of the living because they haven't received judgement yet. Youmu protests that she's always allowed to kill phantoms while in the [[Netherworld]], to which Komachi replies that phantoms in the Netherworld and phantoms above are two different things.

[[Eiki Shiki, Yamaxanadu]] hears about Komachi's confrontation with Youmu and comes to meet Youmu herself. She explains about the phantoms inhabiting the flowers, and that the problem will go away by itself and Youmu should leave it alone. She then goes further about how Youmu's activities in the world of the living are coming dangerously close to getting Youmu classified as living and thus subject to judgement, and decides to carry out a little judgement on Youmu beforehand.

In the end, Youmu arrives back at the Netherworld. Yuyuko was also asked by Eiki to teach Youmu more about the nature of spirits. Unfortunately, [[Yuyuko Saigyouji]] ends up misinterpreting that she's supposed to teach Youmu in a general sense, and ends up teaching Youmu how to pour delicious tea. Eiki in her storyline ends up having to elaborate and clarify her lecture to Youmu when Eiki confronts her again. Youmu's sword works on spirits by severing hesitation, which is the equivalent of helping someone reach Nirvana, and Youmu is not qualified to judge such a thing. In her winquote to Eiki, Youmu apologizes for the trouble she's caused, and thanks Eiki while saying she now understands the nature of her sword.

;''Ten Desires''

[[Rinnosuke]] does in fact have it, and it turns out to be the reason for a large quantity of ghosts floating around the shop recently.

Youmu asks Yuyuko while they are seeing a cloudy harvest moon about [[Ran Yakumo]]'s intentions, who exactly one lunar month before came to the [[Netherworld]] to ask them to look for the [[Remilia Scarlet|vampire]] and her team while they were trying to make the rocket. Although Yuyuko rejected the offert, she explains that day to Youmu that she was indeed observing the movements of the vampire and orders Youmu to tell [[Reimu Hakurei|the shrine maiden]] how to finish the vampire's rocket.&lt;br&gt;
Youmu meets [[Reimu]], [[Marisa]] and [[Sakuya]] in the [[Hakurei Shrine]], who were talking about said fuel. Youmu suggests searching not in the sky, but thinking how ships and other travel methods work to find a way to make the rocket work. Thanks to that, Reimu realizes she needed to call Sumiyoshi (the voyages god).

Afterwards, after Yukari manipulated the border between the illusionary and the real Moon, Yuyuko and her follow her hints to reach the Lunar Capital. There, they search for a valuable object and they come back with a millennial sake.

Yuyuko, Youmu and [[Satori Komeji]] head out in order to find Marisa, discovering her in [[Alice Margatroid]]'s house, who was also now in a coma.
They tie Marisa up and interrogate her, threatening Marisa with her sword so that she won't try to move.

==Relationships==
===[[Yuyuko Saigyouji]]===
Youmu's mistress, ever since Youmu was born (stated by Youmu in ''[[Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red]]''). Youmu is completely loyal to her, but has trouble understanding her.

===[[Youki Konpaku]]===
Youmu was Youki's student, and also his successor as the gardener of Hakugyokurou. She believes that his disappearance is some kind of lesson from him. 

===[[Yukari Yakumo]]===
The friend of Youmu's mistress. Youmu respects her greatly and she helps Youmu with lessons and advice, but Youmu doesn't understand her, either. She also treats Yukari's servant, [[Ran Yakumo]], with professional respect, even though Yuyuko says she doesn't have to.

===Residents of [[Eientei]]===
From ''[[Imperishable Night]]'', Youmu is one of the few characters that is aware that three of the residents of [[Eientei]] are from the [[Moon]], and presumably keeping it a secret like the others.

===[[Eiki Shiki, Yamaxanadu]]===
As a [[yama]], Eiki is one of the superiors of Youmu's mistress, Yuyuko. Youmu is aware of the role of the yama and respects Eiki greatly, but hadn't met her in-person until ''[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]''. In Youmu's ending, Eiki also asked Yuyuko to teach Youmu more about the nature of cutting down spirits. Eiki notes if Youmu loses to her in the story mode that Youmu would normally not go to Eiki for judging upon death.

===[[Komachi Onozuka]]===
Youmu and Komachi first met in ''Phantasmagoria of Flower View''. As a ferryman under the yama, Komachi could also be considered a fellow employee of sorts with Youmu, although their lines of work do not cross very often. Youmu is aware of Komachi's position and respects her a lot, often thanking her for her work on ferrying the dead whenever the two meet. Komachi also tries to teach Youmu about how Youmu should not cut down ghosts too often, and sees Youmu as "an interesting fellow" in ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]''.

===Others in general===
Youmu is acquainted with many other major characters (be it from their visits to the Netherworld or Youmu's own investigations), but generally not close to them personally. Being straight forward and earnest, Youmu tends to get picked on a lot.

==Additional Information==
*Her music theme is titled "Hiroari Shoots A Strange Bird ~ Till When?", named after a story in [[wikipedia:Taiheiki|Taiheiki]], which a warrior named Hiroari slays a [[youkai]] known as {{nihongo||以津真天|Itsumade}}. This is an homage to the storyline. Judging from the story of ''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]'', the heroine plays the role of Hiroari, Youmu is Itsumade, and the corpse is probably [[Yuyuko Saigyouji]]. (See also [[Flandre Scarlet]] and [[Yukari Yakumo]].)
*In ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]'', Youmu's spell card [https://youtu.be/WOIhlbyS5Ic&amp;t=31 "Reincarnation Sword "Slash of Circular Vicissitude""] resembles [https://youtu.be/Du8Z5-QI2LQ&amp;t=378 one of Grant's move] from ''[[w:Garou: Mark of the Wolves|Garou: Mark of the Wolves]]''. Youmu does perform the move using her hands whereas Grant does perform it using his legs.

'''Konpaku Youmu'''

Stage 5 boss, a being of half-[[human]] and half-[[phantom]]. She's both the second gardener for the Saigyouji clan and the guardian of their mistress. Mainly she posses the ability to handle sword techniques.

Youmu looks after the garden with two swords: ''Roukan-ken'', a long sword that has the power of killing ten phantoms in a single strike, and ''Hakurou-ken'', a short one that can slash down the confusion of humans.

[[Youki Konpaku]], the former gardener, had been the one for about 300 years, but suddenly became a hermit after having made a very young Youmu his successor. Youmu's ability of swordsmanship has still been in progress, so she needs daily practice. Though Youmu herself has no clue where her master is, she thinks of her master's absence as a lesson from him.

This time, following the order the mistress of Saigyouji gave her, she has gathered all of spring essences in [[Gensokyo]] to make [[Saigyou Ayakashi]] bloom fully.

Here in [[Hakugyokurou]], there are so many cherry blossoms besides Saigyou Ayakashi, which has never bloomed. The former gardener said, "I've seen the fully-bloomed Saigyou Ayakashi before, but this might be the last time." At that time, Youmu had no idea what he meant and why the mistress of Saigyouji gave her such an order.

Youmu sweeps the garden of the Saigyouji family; it's said to be about 200 yojanas long (The mistress exaggerates, of course).&lt;ref name="Yojana"&gt; ''[[wikipedia:Yojana|Yojana]]'' ({{lang|sa|योजन }}) is a unit of the distance that was used in ancient India. The exact length of the unit was not defined, but it's said that 1 yojana equals about 10-15 kilometers. In other words, if you taken Yuyuko's word as it is, then the Saigyouji's garden is supposed to be about 2,000-3,000 kilometers long.&lt;/ref&gt; This garden has a terrifyingly large amount of cherry trees, where they are attractions for residents all over the [[Netherworld]]. When spring comes, Youmu is very busy in sweeping. 

This year isn't the exception, too. The phantoms are really thrilled by the wonderful cherry trees. Everyone said, "I'm happy to be a phantom!" On the other hand, Youmu, the half-human saw this raving scene and half-sympathised by saying: "I'm ''half'' happy to be a ''half'' phantom!"

Now, all she should do is wait for the blooming of Saigyou Ayakashi.

　　　性格は何事にも一所懸命だが、それが報われることが少ない。癖のある連中が多すぎる幻想郷では、真っ直ぐ過ぎてからかわれやすい性格でもある。

　　　体術は半人前ながらも非常に優れている。妖術も半人前ながら優れており、実はバランスが取れている。妖怪が鍛えたという楼観剣と白楼剣を操り、敵だろうが霊だろうが弾幕だろうが人の悩みだろうが斬ることが出来る。斬れない物は少ししかない。

　　　楼観剣（長い方）は一振りで幽霊10匹分の殺傷力を持つ。白楼剣は、人間の迷いを斬る事が出来ると言われているが、勿論、両方とも生身の人間を斬ることも出来る。

'''Konpaku Youmu'''

Species: Half-[[human]] half-[[phantom]]&lt;br /&gt;
Location: [[Hakugyokurou]] in the [[Netherworld]]&lt;br /&gt;
Ability: Handling sword techniques

A gardener who works in Hakugyokurou and lives there. She's half-human and half-phantom, half-dead and half-alive, half-phantom and half-reality, and altogether half-baked. Yet she has two swords.

She applies all her effort to anything and everything, but it hardly ever pays off. Compared to the quirky cast of characters that inhabits Gensokyo, her all too straightforward personality makes her easy to tease.

She's very good at fighting arts for someone so half-baked. She's also quite good at magic for such a half-baked character, and actually has a good sense of balance between the two. Using the Roukanken and Hakurouken, which were said to be forged by [[youkai]], she can cut through enemies and spirits and bullets and people's worries. The things she can't cut through are next to none.

Roukanken (the longer one) has the power to kill ten phantoms in one slash. Hakurouken is said to be able to cut through people's confusion, but of course, both of them can also kill living humans.

She attacks her enemy with Roukanken and Hakurouken. She is a useful girl whose body has two half kinds: human and phantom.&lt;br /&gt;
She's supposed to be the swordsmanship teacher of [[Yuyuko Saigyouji|Yuyuko-sama]], still, she has to do the work of a gardener first every day.

She's so immature you can't help liking her because of her straightforward and pure character, yet she's always made fun by anybody for her nature.&lt;br /&gt;
The nature of residents in [[Gensokyo]] is beyond simplicity.

Her weapon is serious manners, which may reaches a sense of desperation.

:Notes:
:This time, she makes her trip with Yuyuko.
:Focused movement is only available when she's alone.
:It's difficult to master her because of her narrow range of attack and the unique movement of her soul figure.
:When you use her [[Spell Card]], you can't move.
:Besides, her Spell Card is also hard to use...
:By the way, you can return the soul figure back to Youmu by changing to Yuyuko.
:Mastering her is absolutely important when using her.

She's the gardener of [[Hakugyokurou]], which is in the world past death, but actually she is a swordmanship teacher for Yuyuko.

Even she herself is not certain whether she is alive or not, or whether she is considered a human.
Even though she has longer life expectancy than human's, it seems that she can experience death, so maybe she is alive.
Konpaku's swords were designed primarily for use against spiritual beings, but they still seem to work well against living beings.

She is always busy doing her chores as the gardener of the incredibly large [[Hakugyokurou]] garden. She's straightforward and always on her duty, but very easy to deceive. The phantoms haven't been making much of a fuss these days, so she's somewhat peace-addled.

The bizarre spirits that suddenly appeared-- "divine spirits"-- were beings composed of the desires of humans. Their existence was transient, so they disappeared quickly, but she went off to investigate hoping that there will be no more incidents relating to any kind of spirits in the future.

{{nihongo|'''Yukari Yakumo'''|八雲　紫|Yakumo Yukari}} is a legendary [[youkai]] who is able to manipulate boundaries. She is the master of [[Ran Yakumo]]. She is called the {{nihongo|"[[gap]] youkai"|すきま妖怪|sukima youkai}},&lt;ref&gt;As indicated by Ran and [[Chen]]'s titles&lt;/ref&gt; although "gap youkai" is not the name of a species, as she is more of a one-of-a-kind type of youkai.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red]] - [[Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red/Yukari|Yukari]]&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of her power, Yukari appears to be the most ''well-informed'' being in Gensokyo of any kind and usually achieves her goals through manipulating events rather than direct combat.

==General Information==
Yukari first appeared as the phantasm stage boss of ''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]'' with [[Ran Yakumo]] serving her as [[shikigami]]. Despite being a high-class boss compared to other Extra and Final stage bosses, she's made occasional appearances in later games. She was a playable character in ''[[Imperishable Night]]'', partnered with [[Reimu Hakurei]] (and supported her in ''[[Subterranean Animism]]''), and was playable in the fighting games, but was only a cameo in the background of ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]''. Also, she was also an Extra stage target in ''[[Shoot the Bullet]]'' and appeared on the Final Day of ''[[Impossible Spell Card]]''.

She is one of the oldest [[youkai]] in [[Gensokyo]], one of the strongest of youkai, and is praised as one of the wisest of youkai.&lt;ref name="PMiSSYukari"&gt;[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]: [[Perfect_Memento_in_Strict_Sense/Yukari Yakumo|Yukari Yakumo]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BAiJRRan"&gt;[[Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red]]: [[Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red/Ran|Ran Yakumo]]&lt;/ref&gt;. She was one who proposed the [[Great Hakurei Barrier]], which covers Gensokyo, and is therefore tied to Gensokyo's creation. She is the only known youkai who is able to pass this barrier in order to access the [[Outside World]], although there are a few instances like [[Mamizou Futatsuiwa]] who's passed it. She also performs surveillance and safety administration (mainly for [[Ran Yakumo]]). She is simply one of the most mysterious youkai living in Gensokyo.

===Personality===
Yukari is known for being a very [[youkai]]-like youkai who sleeps all day and lives for the enjoyment of life. Though she rarely leaves her house, she's well-connected and is acquainted with most of the most powerful youkai as well as anyone having anything to do with the [[Great Hakurei Barrier]] or the [[Outside World|outside world]], although she rarely attacks [[human]]s.&lt;ref name="PMiSSYukari" /&gt; She has a tendency to toy with her opponents rather than use her full power from the start. If anyone is suited for the role of "mastermind", it's Yukari. She excels at mathematics and is experienced due to her long life.

She possesses superhuman intellect and especially surpasses in dealing with numbers. In ''[[Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red]]'', as [[Ran Yakumo]] said, this intellect is something that even Ran is not able to understand, to the extent that for example that she is able to determine the depths of the darkness of Avici or determine in an instant how long it would take for Ursa Major to devour the North Star, as it seems. Concretely to what extent this amazing intellect goes is hard to know, but it would be no mistake to think that this intellect far surpasses that of humans.

She often has a great deal of insight and understanding about whatever happens in Gensokyo, and possesses considerable intellectual prowess, as well. Though she seems flaky and unreliable most of the time, when the safety or security of Gensokyo is at stake, she won't hesitate to get involved, even if it means using others to do the work for her. For example, in ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]'', she treats [[Tenshi Hinanawi]] with much hostility after finding out the plot of the [[Heaven]]s. She could easily be either a villain or a heroine, depending on her whims.

Yukari deals with problems by manipulating others to act to resolve things for her. She seems to rarely act directly except in particularly egregious situations. In all cases, she rarely lets anyone know what her true aims or goals are and sometimes these goals are extremely abstract. Yukari has a well-deserved reputation of being fickle, whimsical and lying often and thus many characters in [[Gensokyo]] dislike her. For whatever reason, Yukari takes it all in stride and does not seriously deny any of those comments. She seems to actively try to keep her more obviously-altruistic actions a secret, such as her donations to the [[Hakurei Shrine]] in ''[[Strange and Bright Nature Deity]]''. She possibly cultivates this image to ensure that people continue to fear her as a [[youkai]], as this is what her true goal for a particularly complex gambit is revealed to be at the end of ''[[Cage in Lunatic Runagate]]''.

===Abilities===
; Strength 
Yukari is with no doubt one of the most powerful [[youkai]] in [[Gensokyo]]. She has been described as an extremely powerful being more than once,&lt;ref&gt;Yukari's [[Touhou Bougetsushou]] profile&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yukari's [[Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red]] profile&lt;/ref&gt;, with easily enough power to destroy all of Gensokyo if it's needed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Imperishable Night]] - Yukari's Profile&lt;/ref&gt;. In [[Silent Sinner in Blue]], Yukari claimed [[Watatsuki no Toyohime]] was stronger than her and avoided a direct confrontation with her, although at the time she was purposedly letting herself being captured.

Her physical strength is what you'd expect from a youkai. While the extent of an average youkai's strength is never really specified, their bodily ability is typically very high, so her strength is still far from that of a [[human]]. 
There are some examples and statements which show Yukari's physical prowess:
*In [[Curiosities of Lotus Asia/Chapter 12|''Curiosities of Lotus Asia'' Chapter 12]], Yukari's hand is able to effortlessly block and brush aside a mallet swung by [[Rinnosuke Morichika]] with all his might, leaving him shocked that a small slender feminine hand was able to pull off such a feat. Rinnosuke said that it feels like he hit a pillow. 
*[[Hong Meiling]], in one of her ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]'' win quotes, notes that she felt a odd resistance from Yukari's body (presumably after punching and kicking her a lot), to the point where she wondered if Yukari was wearing something else under that presumably delicate dress of hers.

Yukari states in her own win quotes in ''[[Immaterial and Missing Power]]'' that she has no weaknesses, and even shooting, cutting, stabbing, hitting, or killing her is useless.&lt;ref&gt;[[Immaterial and Missing Power]] - Yukari's Script: &lt;br /&gt;
'''Yukari''':Shooting, cutting, stabbing, hitting, killing... It's all useless against me.&lt;br /&gt;

'''Yukari''': I'll tell you a secret. My weakness is... nothing. &lt;/ref&gt;

;Gaps

The ability to use {{nihongo|"[[gap]]s"|すきま|sukima}} is the most prominent ability that Yukari utilizes. They act as portals between two places, where she's able to hold, sit on or emerge from such gaps. Because of this, she's able to show up at any place and can freely travel to places like the Outside World. Within these gaps one can see a lot of eyes, which according to the description of Yukari's ''Magic Eye "Laplace's Demon"'' [[spell card]] she can also use to see. Yukari can create gaps through which only she can pass, or which anything can pass through.&lt;ref&gt;[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Yukari_Yakumo|Perfect Memento in Strict Sense: Yukari Yakumo]] - "No one can follow her through the gaps". Despite this statement, various canon works show her opening gaps for others to use.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, while the main use of gaps is traveling to different places, Yukari also uses them in battle either by virtue of being able to use almost any object (such as tombstones, road signs, and even running trains) as a weapon,&lt;ref&gt;[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]] - "Abandoned Line "Aimless Journey to the Abandoned Station" [[Spellcard]]&lt;/ref&gt; by retreating inside them to avoid being hit or land unexpected attacks,&lt;ref&gt;[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]] - "Fantasy Maniacal Rift" Skill Card&lt;/ref&gt; sucking in an opponent's attacks to throw them back.&lt;ref&gt;[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]] - "Rest on Stone, Rinse in Rivers Rinse with Stone, Rest in Rivers" Skill Card&lt;/ref&gt;, or merging different gaps to create harmful spatial distortions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]] - "Universe of Matter and Antimatter" Skill Card&lt;/ref&gt;

Though seemingly limitless, Yukari's gaps have a limited range to where she's able to connect spaces. During the events of [[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]], Yukari has to use multiple gaps to travel up [[Youkai Mountain]] in order to reach the summit to get to [[Heaven]]. 

By mostly moving around in [[gap]]s, one would usually not see her as doing much physical labor at all, and according to ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]'', since she ends up in blurting out herself such sayings like "to do mountain climbing at such an age", there is the image that she is like an indoors-type [[youkai]], but in the end, she is still a youkai. 

;Manipulation of boundaries
[[File:GoMIllus-Yukari.jpg|thumb|200px|Yukari's "Danmaku Barrier", as illustrated in ''[[The Grimoire of Marisa]]''.]]
[[File:SSIBCH10YukariBorder.jpg|thumb|200px|Yukari using a border for transportation in ''[[Silent Sinner in Blue]]''.]]
Yukari's main ability is manipulating any kind of boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]] - Yukari's profile.&lt;/ref&gt; This ability has been described as logically being able to affect essentially anything.&lt;ref&gt;[[Strange Creators of Outer World/Who's Who of Humans &amp; Youkai in Gensokyo/Yukari Yakumo, Ran Yakumo, and Chen]]&lt;/ref&gt; In her monologue during [[A Beautiful Flower Blooming Violet Every Sixty Years]], she explains that this power allows her to control or remove the boundaries between any and all things, like Gensokyo and the Outside World, the worlds of the living and the dead, humans and youkai and even the day and the night. &lt;ref&gt;[[A Beautiful Flower_Blooming Violet Every Sixty Years]] - '''Yukari''': I'm a youkai with the ability to control the boundaries between any and all things. This power allows me to remove the boundary between anything: Gensokyo and the outside world, the worlds of the living and the dead, humans and youkai, even day and night.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'', manipulating boundaries is described as a terrifying god-like ability with no weak points which there is no defense or countermeasure against, capable of fundamentally undermining reality itself and as one of the most dangerous abilities that youkai are known to possess, while Yukari's manual profile in ''[[Imperishable Night]] says that ''"the danger and potency of her ability is beyond imagination"''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Imperishable Night]] - Manual: The danger and potency of the power to manipulate boundaries is beyond imagination. In order to wield it, you'd have to either be a somewhat-weird [[youkai]] like Yukari, or someone who can withstand the power's pressure.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Ultimately, everything is built upon the existence of boundaries; if there were no boundaries everything would effectively exist as a single enormous object. Because of this, the ability to manipulate boundaries is logically an ability of both creation and destruction: by making a new boundary is to create a new existence, and to destroy a boundary is to negate an existence. For example, as said in ''Perfect Memento'', if there was no water surface there could be no lake, if there was no sky line neither mountain nor sky could exist and were it not for the Great Barrier even Gensokyo itself wouldn't exist. Furthermore, it seems that not only are physical boundaries, but also the general idea of boundaries can be manipulated and it seems like she would be able to manipulate the boundary between dreams and reality, which could very well be how she was able to drag the real [[Sumireko Usami]] out of the [[Dream World]] in [[Antinomy of Common Flowers]]. Yukari is also capable of seeing (and seeing through) boundaries that are normally invisible; when the [[Human Village]] was displaced from history by [[Keine Kamishirasawa]], Yukari was completely unfazed and still able to see it.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Imperishable Night]]'' Stage 3 - "Hey hey. I do see the humans as usual though. A deception of this level isn't useful at all, is it?"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Strange Creators of Outer World/Introduction of Previous Works/Imperishable Night/Cross Review| Strange Creators of Outer World - Imperishable Night Cross Review]]&lt;/ref&gt;  She also tells Marisa that it would easy for her to manipulate the boundary between Winter and Spring.&lt;ref name="PCBMarisaEXtra"&gt;[[Perfect Cherry Blossom/Story/Marisa's Extra|Perfect Cherry Blossom - Marisa's Extra]]&lt;/ref&gt;

It's shown that Yukari can control the boundaries and bend them to her will as seen in ''[[Immaterial and Missing Power]]'' when she adjusted the sky by manipulating the border between the daylight and moonlight to unite the day and the night.&lt;ref name=IaMPDayNight&gt;''[[Immaterial and Missing Power]] Border Line - "While you were teasing me I adjusted the sky to enjoy both night and day. If the night falls now, the sky will be morning. The border of daylight and moonlight is mine"&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Marisa Kirisame]], Yukari can even control the boundary between "a [[danmaku]] for play and a danmaku for battle".&lt;ref name="GoM"&gt;[[The Grimoire of Marisa]]: [[The Grimoire of Marisa/Yukari Yakumo's Spell Cards|Yukari Yakumo]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Yukari is also capable of sensing and repairing damage to the [[Great Hakurei Barrier]], and although in ''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]'' [[Yuyuko Saigyouji]] doubts Yukari could make such a strong barrier,&lt;ref&gt;[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]] Reimu B Ending. Yuyuko comments that she doesn't think even Yukari could have made the Hakurei barrier by herself.&lt;/ref&gt; she has been refered to as its creator in various occasions.&lt;ref name ="Wahh25"&gt;[[Wild and Horned Hermit]] - '''Chapter 25:''' Reimu refers to Yukari as the creator of the barrier.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CoLA26"&gt;[[Curiosities of Lotus Asia]] - '''Chapter 26:''' Prologue and Rinnosuke's monologue.&lt;/ref&gt; To add to all this, [[Hieda no Akyuu]] writes that "manipulation of boundaries" is theoretically a godlike power which would allow Yukari to create or destroy anything, but that all the stories about it are impossible to confirm.&lt;ref name="PMiSSYukari" /&gt; 

In ''[[Silent Sinner in Blue]]'' she is able to utilize her ability to create a portal to the "fantastic" side of the [[Moon]] using the moon's reflection on a lake's surface (a boundary) and only during the full moon, which is the only period of time during which the passage is open. For some unknown reason she is unable to use her powers to bring a ''living being'' on the far side of the Moon, which is where the [[Lunar Capital]] is located. Despite how limitless her ability sounds, there are in fact limitations, usually in relation to other powerful entities. 

Examples of the usage of this ability:
*Neutralized [[Suika Ibuki]]'s ability by forcing the oni, which was spread as mist over the entirety of Gensokyo, into her normal form so that she could be seen and interacted with by others.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Immaterial and Missing Power]]'' (several scenarios): After being defeated as the penultimate boss, Yukari makes Suika take her normal form so that she could be seen.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Adjusted the sky by manipulating the border between the daylight and moonlight, to unite the day and the night.&lt;ref name=IaMPDayNight /&gt; Possibly, this also allowed Yukari to stop the night in [[Imperishable Night]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Imperishable Night/Story/Barrier Team's Scenario]] - Stage 4&lt;/ref&gt;
*Manipulation of the boundary between the true and illusionary [[moon]], which allowed her to open a gap, that lead from [[Gensokyo]] to the [[Moon]], on the lake surface. (Lunar War, ''[[Silent Sinner in Blue]]'')
*By creating the Boundary of Fantasy and Reality, she estabilished the [[Outside World]] as the real world, and [[Gensokyo]] as an illusionary one, allowing youkai to disappear from the former and thrive in the latter. (''Youkai Expansion Project'', over 500 years ago)
*She is widely acknowledged as the creator of the [[Great Hakurei Barrier]], which isolates Gensokyo from the Outside World. (The Great Barrier Disturbance)
*Upon Yuyuko's request, weakening the [[Border of Life and Death]] between the world of the living and the [[Netherworld]], making it possible for denizens of both world to easily cross it. (''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]'')&lt;ref name="PMiSSYukari" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Perfect_Memento_in_Strict_Sense/Youmu_Konpaku|Perfect Memento in Strict Sense: Youmu Konpaku]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Strange Creators of Outer World/Basic Knowledge of Fantastic Words 2015]]&lt;/ref&gt;
*When the Great Hakurei Barrier has loosened, she returned [[Rinnosuke Morichika]] to Gensokyo who has been ejected into the outside world (''[[Curiosities of Lotus Asia]]'')
*Dragged the real [[Sumireko Usami]] out of the [[Dream World]] (''[[Antinomy of Common Flowers]]'')
*By manipulating the border of master and slave during the [[Antinomy of Common Flowers|Perfect Possession incident]], she thwarted [[Joon Yorigami|Joon]] and [[Shion Yorigami]]'s scheme that allowed Joon to win any battle by forcing Shion as the enemy's slave (''[[Antinomy of Common Flowers]]'')
*Many of her [[Spell Card]]s and attacks allude to various circumstances involving boundary manipulation or creation, such as: ''Barrier "Balance of Motion and Stillness"'', ''Barrier "Mesh of Light and Darkness"'', ''"Boundary of Humans and Youkai"'', ''Barrier "Charming Quadruple Barrier"'', between many others. The description of Yukari's ''"Boundary of Intellect and Feet"'' states that she would be able to cut anything by using boundaries, a motif also used in her ''Splitter "Thing That Splits All Into Two"'' Spell Card.
*According to herself, when humans have noctambulism it's because she manipulates the boundary between sleeping and being awake.&lt;ref name="PCBMarisaEXtra" /&gt;
;Onmyoudou
Yukari is skilled in [[wikipedia:Onmyoudou|Onmyoudou]], the [[Taoism]]-derived arts of traditional Japanese court wizards, and specializes in spells which create and manipulate barriers (presumably due to overlap with her innate abilities). Yukari has been able to teach some of her spells to [[Reimu Hakurei]], whose own techniques have similar roots.

Yukari also displays great aptitude with [[shikigami]], binding [[Ran Yakumo|a powerful kitsune]] and [[Yukari's crows|numerous lesser servants]] at once. As Shikigami are stronger when following the right orders, Yukari must also be skilled at giving the correct orders to fully maximize her shikigamis' potential. In an [[Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red/Ran|interview]] with [[Aya Shameimaru]], [[Ran Yakumo]] states that despite sleeping most of the time, Yukari is capable of giving orders no one else would think up the instant she opens her mouth, and Yukari uses complex equations to increase Ran's power indefinitely (This manner of using shikigami is likely one of the reasons Yukari views computers and shikigami as one and the same).

;Various
*'''Talking without sound:''' Yukari was able to talk to [[Luna Child]] even after the fairy erased all sound around her. As decribed, it was a voice that Luna heard in her own heart. It's unknown if this ability is part of her main ability over boundaries. ([[Eastern and Little Nature Deity/Fairy of the Moon|Fairy of the Moon]])
*'''Resisting Suika's power:''' According to Suika, Yukari was the only one able to resist her power, which she used to gather everyone's thoughts making them have banquets for several days.&lt;ref&gt;[[Immaterial and Missing Power]] - Alice's scenario&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Immaterial and Missing Power]])

==Backstory==
According to ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'', an apparent article on Yukari appears in the first edition of the Gensokyo Chronicle from 1,200 years ago. However, this article did not refer to her name as "Yukari Yakumo"&lt;ref name="PMiSSYukari" /&gt;. It is believed she chose this name for herself, the name "Yukari" signifying that she was a youkai of [[boundary|boundaries]], and the name "Yakumo" from a poem about creating a great fenced mansion where one can live a peaceful life in seclusion, and a strong fortress to keep the [[god]]s trapped inside.&lt;ref&gt;[[Curiosities of Lotus Asia/Chapter_26]]&lt;/ref&gt; This land would be [[Gensokyo]].

===Saigyou Ayakashi Occurrence===
Over a thousand years ago, Yukari met and became friends with a [[human]] girl named [[Yuyuko Saigyouji]]. Over time, Yuyuko was driven to suicide out of despair over her ability to control death. After Yuyuko died, her body was used to seal the [[Saigyou Ayakashi]], a [[youkai]] tree which drained the lives of too many humans, by an unknown individual who hoped Yuyuko would never have to suffer and experience pain again. The seal was created as the boundary between life and death. Yukari continued to be friends with Yuyuko's [[ghost (Species)|ghost]], although Yuyuko gradually forgot who she had been and why she had died&lt;ref&gt;[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]: Yuyuko and Yukari's profiles. Applies to the entire paragraph&lt;/ref&gt;.

It is not stated who sealed the Saigyou Ayakashi. It was someone who held Yuyuko very dear, judging by the record ("My wish... is that she will never again reincarnate, and never again suffer pain..."). Yuyuko's profile describes the hypothetical breaking of the seal as "breaching the boundary". The boundary sealing the Saigyou Ayakashi is apparently the boundary between life and death, as this is what [[Perfect Cherry Blossom/Afterword|the BGM that plays during the Saigyou Ayakashi's reflowering]] represents. [[Perfect Cherry Blossom/Spell Cards/Phantasm#Spell Card 140|Boundary of Life and Death]] is one of Yukari's spell cards. This possibly implies it was Yukari who sealed the Saigyou Ayakashi. Yukari's profile reveals she knew all along that Yuyuko's body was sealing it, and gives a clear motive, as the tree was killing too many humans. As another possible indication, ''[[The Grimoire of Marisa]]'' brings up [[wikipedia:Zhuangzi#The butterfly dream|the butterfly dream]] regarding Yuyuko's spell card during the Saigyou Ayakashi's reflowering, which is a theme associated with Yukari.

One day, Yuyuko requested that Yukari use her power to repair the border between the [[Netherworld]] and Gensokyo. Yukari sleepily set off to do so. She had known Yuyuko's plan to make the [[Saigyou Ayakashi]] bloom could never succeed, but was too busy sleeping to say or do anything about it, or to put the border back to normal after everything was finished, which put her on a collision course with the heroines of ''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]''.

===Lunar War===
Also over a thousand years ago, the youkai now named Yukari Yakumo&lt;ref name="CiLRLastCh"&gt;[[Cage in Lunatic Runagate]]: [[Cage in Lunatic Runagate/Last_Chapter|Last_Chapter]]&lt;/ref&gt; organized an army of youkai and led them in an invasion of the [[Moon]], of which Yuyuko was also present for&lt;ref name="CiLRCh7"&gt;[[Cage in Lunatic Runagate]]: [[Cage in Lunatic Runagate/Seventh Chapter|Chapter 7]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CiLRLastCh" /&gt;. Publicly, Yukari states the invasion was to take the [[Lunarian]]s' source of power, an infinite energy source which let them play all day.&lt;ref&gt;[[Silent Sinner in Blue]]: Chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the youkai were subsequently routed by the [[Lunarian]]s, who possessed superior technology and magic, and forced to retreat to Earth. While Yukari claims she organized the invasion out of desire for that power, her true purpose may be that she did it to teach the youkai a lesson about starting wars of conquest; namely, that it was a bad idea, as since that time, no youkai have attempted to expand their territory beyond Gensokyo.&lt;ref name="PMiSSYukari" /&gt;

===Border of Gensokyo===
Since then, Yukari has had numerous roles in managing Gensokyo and the youkai. She authored a system of constellations for the youkai&lt;ref name="CoLACh22"&gt;[[Curiosities of Lotus Asia]]: [[Curiosities of Lotus Asia/Chapter 22|Chapter 22]]&lt;/ref&gt;. She enacted the Youkai Expansion Project 500 years ago by creating a border between illusion and reality around Gensokyo. She was one of the sages who suggested the creation of the [[Great Hakurei Barrier]] 120 years ago, and is believed to be its creator,&lt;ref name ="Wahh25" /&gt; or at least one of its creators&lt;ref name="PMiSSYukari" /&gt;

The Gensokyo Record in [[Perfect Cherry Blossom/Translation/Prologue|''Perfect Cherry Blossom''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s prologue]] says that the original Gensokyo boundary (presumably the first "boundary between inside and outside" mentioned in Yukari's ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'' article) was created by priests, but [[ZUN]] said in his [[ZUN's E-mails|e-mails]] that the Gensokyo Record is not reliable, and that only the long lived youkai knows the true history of Gensokyo. [[Hieda no Akyuu]] firmly believes Yukari was involved, and the prologue of [[Curiosities of Lotus Asia/Chapter 26|''Curiosities of Lotus Asia'', Chapter 26]],&lt;ref name="CoLA26" /&gt;. states that Yukari being the creator of the barrier that separates the human world and Gensokyo is an ongoing rumor. According to Rinnosuke, Yukari's power is what separates Gensokyo from the outside world,&lt;ref name="CoLA26" /&gt; and Reimu refered to Yukari as the creator of the barrier when explaining its properties to [[Kasen Ibaraki]] and [[Marisa Kirisame]].&lt;ref name = Wahh25 /&gt;

===Yukari and "The Vampire Incident"===
Regarding the Vampire Incident in ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'', it is not stated who were the powerful youkai that defeated the [[vampire]], who signed the contract with the vampire, or who was the one who wrote the original draft of the [[Spell Card]] rules that came afterwards (as it was also written on youkai contract paper, [[Hieda no Akyuu]] feels it wasn't the [[Shrine Maiden]]). However, the colophon at the end reveals that Yukari is the author of a work called "Vampire Pact". This possibly implies her involvement in at least one of these things (if not all three) in the fact that Yukari may've had been involved in the deal with the devil, [[Remilia Scarlet]].  At the very least, [[Strange_Creators_of_Outer_World/Who%27s_Who_of_Humans_%26_Youkai_in_Gensokyo/Yukari_Yakumo,_Ran_Yakumo,_and_Chen|Strange Creators of Outer World]] states that she was apparently involved in the creation of the spell card rules.

On the related note to the contract, it's explicitly stated in her ''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]'' profile that she's the one responsible for [[outsider]]s ending up in Gensokyo, where most of them get devoured by youkai. Her involvement is made even more explicit in Chapter 14 of ''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'', where Yukari reveals to [[Kasen Ibaraki]] that having the [[zashiki-warashi]] sent to the [[outside world]] takes precedence above keeping them in Gensokyo, and then cryptically comments, "Gensokyo's getting the food to fill the stomachs of all of its youkai from somewhere." This could further extend to an article on [[Symposium of Post-mysticism/Bunbunmaru Newspaper 3|''Symposium of Post-mysticism'']], where there were human bones near a well, but no human of Gensokyo was missing and Yukari made no reference to the outside world humans, calling it a "misunderstanding"; the bones later on disappeared.

===Underground Agreement===
She made a deal with certain youkai to allow them to have their own realm underground in [[Former Hell]] if they pacified the evil spirits there&lt;ref name="SA-R&amp;Y"&gt;[[Subterranean Animism]]: [[Subterranean Animism/Story/Reimu and Yukari's Scenario|Reimu and Yukari's Scenario]]&lt;/ref&gt;. For a while, Yukari took it upon herself to make regular check-ups on various aspects of Gensokyo such as the [[Human Village]] or the barrier, but eventually took on [[Ran Yakumo]] as a [[shikigami]] and left such tasks to her.&lt;ref name="PMiSSRan"&gt;[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]: [[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Ran_Yakumo|Ran Yakumo]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character Design==
[[File:PMiSS yukari.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Yukari, as illustrated in ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]''.]]
===Name and origin===
Her full name is {{nihongo||八雲　紫|Yukari Yakumo}}. The characters for {{nihongo||八雲|Yakumo}} literally mean "eight clouds", but can also mean "countless clouds", and {{nihongo||紫|Yukari}} means "purple" or "violet" (In ordinary Japanese perspective these two colors are not discriminated).

[[Curiosities of Lotus Asia/Chapter 26|Chapter 26]] of ''[[Curiosities of Lotus Asia]]'' reveals that Yukari gave herself that name, in which she didn't have that name 1,200 years ago&lt;ref name="PMiSSYukari" /&gt;. Probably a coincidence, there is a train service in Japan called {{nihongo|"[[wikipedia:Yakumo (train)|Yakumo]]"|[[wikipedia:ja:やくも (列車)|やくも]]}}.

;Yukari's name related to colors
All of the Yakumo family are named after colors. The light frequencies (energies) of the colors are proportional to their powers: [[Chen]] (orange) &lt;&lt; [[Ran Yakumo]] (indigo) &lt; Yukari (violet). The energy of violet light is the highest in the visible spectrum, and violet light is the boundary between visible and invisible light. Red light (the symbolic color of [[Remilia Scarlet]] or [[Reimu Hakurei]]) is another boundary, but they are stronger than Chen. Fittingly, when Reimu and Yukari team up in ''[[Imperishable Night]]'', they are called the "Boundary Team". In addition to maintaining the [[Great Hakurei Barrier]], their colors form the two boundaries between visible and invisible light. In addition, the word "yukari" is uncommonly used to mean "border" or "edge", albeit with a different character.

Occasionally, double rainbows form after rainfall—there's the rainbow one usually sees (red on the top, and violet at the bottom), and another, larger, fainter one above it. The colors on the second rainbow are reversed—red on the bottom, and violet at the top. In other words, the outside edges of the rainbow are violet—or, put another way, ''violet forms the boundary between the sky and the rainbow''. Thus, Yukari's given name strongly signifies the idea of boundaries.

In Japan (and many other countries) "purple" or "violet" had been thought as a noble color, and used occasionally as a color for ''high ranks''. In fact, [[ZUN]] mentioned in some of his interviews{{Citation needed}} that he was aware of this fact and uses the color on certain character designs to show levels of power and nobility, thus in this sense using both "violet" as her name and in dress shows that Yukari was ''designed'' to be powerful and high ranking.

There is an assumption that her name ''Yakumo'' is taken from the writer [[wikipedia:Lafcadio Hearn|Lafcadio Hearn]], who naturalized as a Japanese citizen and renamed to "Koizumi Yakumo". When fans asked about the implied connection between Yukari and [[Maribel Hearn]] in a [[Doujin Barrier: The Work Called Touhou and the Fantasy of Game Creation|high school open lecture program]], ZUN brought up Lafcadio Hearn but did not elaborate, yet his answer in some way semi-confirmed this connection. ''See [[Maribel Hearn]] article page for details.''

;Yukari's name related to an ancient poem
''Yakumo'' also comes from the first ancient poem written in what would become the Japanese "Tanka" form:
:"Yakumo tatsu / Izumo yagegaki / Tsuma-gomini / Yaegaki tsukuro / Sono yaegaki wo"
:Definitely in keeping with the character's origin/age in the storyline. The translation into English is:
:"Eightfold rising clouds/ Build an eightfold fence / An eightfold Izumo fence / Wherein to keep my bride-- / Oh! splendid eightfold fence"
:This poem was attributed to the god Susanoo. Interpretations vary as to the meaning of the poem.

Yukari's name is thoroughly analyzed in [[Curiosities of Lotus Asia/Chapter 26|chapter 26]] of ''[[Curiosities of Lotus Asia]]'' by [[Rinnosuke Morichika]]. However, Rinnosuke implies at the end that there may be even more meanings hidden in it.

===Design===
Her first appearance was in ''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]'', where she is depicted with purple eyes and long blonde hair. She carries a pink lace parasol and a paper fan and rides on a red [[gap]] that leads to an unknown destination. She wears a deep purple dress, a pale pink mob cap with a thin red ribbon and smaller ribbons tied liberally on her accessories and the tips of her hair.

In her appearances in ''[[Immaterial and Missing Power]]'' and ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]'', her eyes have become dark golden. She wears a purple Chinese-style tabard with various [[#Hexagram|Trigrams]] over a pale pink Western-style dress (similar to [[Ran Yakumo]]'s outfit), wears her hair coiled up into her mob cap, and usually carries a pink parasol. She wears the same outfit in ''[[Imperishable Night]]'', but her hair is left loose. In the Japanese community this outfit is known as the {{nihongo|"Taoist outfit"|道士服}}.

In ''[[Antinomy of Common Flowers]]'', her sleeves get black bands with a white design on them.

According to ZUN, the purple dress in ''Perfect Cherry Blossom'' is her casual daywear and the pink one with the Ba Gua symbol in ''Imperishable Night'' is the work attire she wears when she commands her Shikigami.{{citation needed}}

;Hexagram
The outfit Yukari wears in post-''Perfect Cherry Blossom'' games has two groups of solid/broken lines called [[wikipedia:I Ching|trigrams]] on the front. A solid line represents Yang and a broken line is Yin. The top trigram ({{lang|ja|☱}}) is "dui" or "tui" (open) and is associated with west and water. The bottom trigram ({{lang|ja|☷}}) is "kūn" (field) and is associated with southwest and earth, as well as [[wikipedia:Yoni|Yoni]] (divine passage). The two trigrams together in that order form the [[wikipedia:List of I Ching hexagrams 33-64#Hexagram 45|hexagram]] for "clustering," "gathering together," and "finished", which sounds more fitting for [[Suika Ibuki]].

The hexagram "Ts'ui" formed by the combination of "tui" and "kun" results in a meaning of gathering together to persevere towards a destination. This hexagram signifies also great wisdom which is necessary for leadership when directing an assembly together to create overall prosperity for everyone. Yukari herself can be seen as an overseer of [[Gensokyo]]. Her ability to create [[boundary|boundaries]] would definitely give her the ability to bring everyone together while maintaining the harmony of the "created" world.

Later, she discovers that [[Shinmyoumaru Sukuna]]'s Dream World self has taken the place of the real Shinmyoumaru as [[Tenshi Hinanawi]]'s slave, which gives her the idea of defeating [[Joon Yorigami|Joon]] and [[Shion Yorigami]] by crossing the border of master and slave. Teaming up with [[Reimu Hakurei]], she baits the sisters into swapping the slaves, and makes Reimu and Shion the masters, so she and Joon are exchanged as slaves.

===Literature===
[[File:041BAiJRYukari.jpg|thumb|left|Yukari with [[Aya Shameimaru]] in ''[[Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red]].'']]
;''Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red''
:{{Main|Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red/Yukari|l1=Youkai Practices Animal Abuse}}
After hearing a fox's cry, [[Aya Shameimaru]] went to investigate. She found Yukari beating [[Ran Yakumo]] over the head with an umbrella, which Yukari claimed was only for disciplining her. Because Aya is a ''[[crow]]'' [[tengu]], she feels animal rights are important and was upset by Yukari's "animal abuse".

During the interview Yukari insisted that it was not animal abuse because Ran is a [[shikigami]], which Yukari considered to make her no longer count as being an animal. Yukari explained that as long as a shikigami follows its master's will then it will be as strong as its master. Ran had apparently disobeyed Yukari by doing something she hadn't been ordered to do. Because of that Ran wasn't as strong as she could be and ended up putting herself in danger while relying only on her own strength. This discipline was meant to remind Ran just who her master is so that Ran won't needlessly be in danger by fighting at less than full strength. Aya didn't think that excused it at all.

Yukari also called the [[Bunbunmaru Newspaper]] a shoddy paper and offered to make Aya her shikigami too, which Aya refused.

;''Perfect Memento in Strict Sense''
Yukari edited ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'' and was one of its major sources, according to ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Memorizable Gensokyo|Memorizable Gensokyo]]'', yet did not confirm her involvement in the above events. One common thread regarding them seems to be that they primarily benefited [[human]]s, not [[youkai]] (the vampire contract even went so overboard towards protecting humans that youkai complained to the shrine maiden). In addition to this, she has her own in-universe article that provides encyclopedic information about her.
[[File:SaBNDYukari.png|thumb|200px|Yukari appearance in [[Strange and Bright Nature Deity]]]]
;''Touhou Bougetsushou''
[[Ran Yakumo]] tells [[Remilia Scarlet]] in ''[[Silent Sinner in Blue]]'' chapter 3 that Yukari invaded the [[moon]] to procure its secret of power to improve the youkai quality of life. This is probably the official reason Yukari gave all youkai for the war, as otherwise, Remilia could confirm Ran was lying just by asking around. However, privately, in [[Cage in Lunatic Runagate/Fifth_Chapter|''Cage in Lunatic Runagate'' Chapter 5]], Yukari reveals to Ran that she knew it was impossible for the beings of Earth to ever win a direct confrontation against the [[Lunarian]]s. It is never stated when Yukari made this realization, so it is possible she knew this even before the first Genso-Lunar War. In addition, [[Cage in Lunatic Runagate/Last_Chapter|The last chapter]] of ''[[Cage in Lunatic Runagate]]'' has the line, "While it was Yukari who led the invasion that had ''convincingly'' failed more than one thousand years ago,". The word "convincingly" could imply it was staged. If this was the case, then presumably the outcome where youkai decided to stop expanding beyond [[Gensokyo]] was Yukari's true intent.

;''Wild and Horned Hermit''
In chapter 33, while Reimu was cooking for a party, she is interrumpted by Yukari, who brings her some plants to help her in the feast. Lately, in the party, she explains that those plants are western dandelions, an invasive plant which could move the japanese dandelions and change Gensokyo's ecosystem. Because of that, she decides to write an article in the newspaper claiming to be health food for humans and luxury for youkai. As a result, they were very demanded, they were used for cooking and the thread was resolved peacefully.

In chapter 35, [[Kasen Ibara]] opens a hole in the barrier to check the reason why she noticed a distorsion in the barrier. She feels an arm and grabs it thinking it was a disappeared villager, but it was just Yukari. She asks about the spiriting away, and Yukari responds that is something she does, but the "humaning away" is relationed to [[Sumireko Usami]]. She explains how everytime Sumireko enters Gensokyo the barrier needs to kick someone of similar power in order to lessen the shock. At first, it only affected little things, but now it seems to kick humans too. Yukari comes up with the idea of using dummies with similar weight. Furthermore, she says she will wait as much as necessary until Kasen comes to "this side". Kasen replies telling her that won't happen. They are interrupted by Reimu, who thinks Yukari is the culprit and she defeats her, without noticing that Kasen ran away before she arrived.

;''Strange and Bright Nature Deity''
In chapter 23, Yukari appears at the [[Hakurei Shrine]] and make [[Reimu]] and [[Marisa]] follow her to a tree that grow back to normal after being struck by a lighting. After realizing the [[Three Fairies of Light]] wanted to live there, she decided to prove their strength to see if they could make some unwanted secondary effects with their magic. After seeing they were very weak and that that concern is not necessary, she leaves them leave there. &lt;br&gt;
In chapter 25, Yukari explains to Reimu and Marisa that that tree appeared in Gensokyo as a result of replacing another, which was in the barrier. As no fairy lived there and Reimu worshiped it as a god and almost intermediately abandon it, the tree started to get worse. That would make a hole in the barrier, but now that [[Sunny]], [[Luna]] and [[Star]] lived there, the problem was solved. 

;''Symposium of Post-mysticism''
[[File:ThGK Bunbunmaru3.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Yukari with [[Kisume]] in ''[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]].'']]
:{{Main|Symposium of Post-mysticism/Bunbunmaru Newspaper 3|l1=Symposium of Post-mysticism: Skeletal Remains Found from the Dry Well}}
Back in 1984, [[Aya Shameimaru]] reports that during Gensokyo's winter, children were finding skeletal remains of a [[human]] while playing around a dried-up well, to which it ended up that the well was declared to be off-limits. Apparently, a [[tsurube-otoshi]] [[youkai]] (presumably [[Kisume]]) came out of well saying "So is THIS the body you dropped down here?" and threw the bones at them. There were no-one missing, so for who the bones belong to is a mystery.

The bones disappeared while no-one was looking during preparations to bury it in [[Muenzuka]]. This rolled onto a case whether there was any sort of [[incident]] or not, along with the identity of the previous owner of the bones. Yukari thought it was by the youkai from the [[Underworld]] and that they wanted to scare the humans since their powers come from the negative energy of humans, but it may've been a simple misunderstanding. There was a non-intervention agreement pact made between the underworld youkai and the surface, so the situation could become complicated.

The incident was settled as silver birch branches have been mistaken for bones, to which no ominous occurrences had happened at the [[Human Village]]. At a later date, it was confirmed that the dried-up well was filled in with dirt; who did this is unknown.

;''Forbidden Scrollery''
{{Stub|section}}

==Connections with the Outside World==
In [[Curiosities of Lotus Asia/Chapter 11|Chapter 11]] and [[Curiosities of Lotus Asia/Chapter 12|Chapter 12]] of ''[[Curiosities of Lotus Asia]]'', when [[Rinnosuke Morichika]] had an [[wikipedia:iPod|iPod]] in [[Kourindou]], only Yukari knew how to actually use it, and further knew that it was considered a trendy item in the [[Outside World]]. She similarly knew about the [[wikipedia:Nintendo|Nintendo]] [[wikipedia:Game Boy|Game Boy]] and [[wikipedia:Nintendo DS|DS]]. She appears very knowledgeable about the outside world.

Because of her understanding of technology from the outside world, there are rumors that she lives in the outside world from time to time. It is confirmed that she at least visits there. Reimu mentions in [[Curiosities of Lotus Asia/Chapter 24|''Curiosities of Lotus Asia'' Chapter 24]] that Yukari told her that she gets to enjoy twice the amount of cherry blossom viewings a year because she also goes to watch the blossoms in the outside world, which occurs at a different time from Gensokyo's. In addition, Yukari at the end of Chapter 25 of ''[[Strange and Bright Nature Deity]]'' is shown viewing the [[Hakurei Shrine]] from the outside world (some panels focus specifically on pointing out there are cars driving by).

[[Marisa Kirisame]] once stated that Yukari uses a small box to talk to her [[shikigami]] when they are far away from her, which led Rinnosuke to believe that she owns a phone. She has given characters phone-like devices in ''[[Subterranean Animism]]''. Yukari mentions in ''[[Oriental Sacred Place]]'' chapter 10 that radio towers fall into Gensokyo every once in a while. Presumably her phones use those in order to work.

Many of her fighting game win quotes make references to the outside world.

It was said that she lived in an estate somewhere in [[Gensokyo]], but other than that, nothing is known. It is said that her residence is at the end of Gensokyo just like how the [[Hakurei Shrine]] is, but the true location is completely unclear.

==Relationships==
Using her [[gap]] to travel across [[Gensokyo]], despite sleeping a lot, Yukari has encountered many [[youkai]] and [[human]]s in the ''[[Touhou Project]]''. By many residents of Gensokyo, she is commonly referred to as the "Gap Youkai" when she's involved in a conversation.

===[[Reimu]] and [[Marisa]]===
[[File:CoLAReimuYukari.jpg|thumb|192px|Yukari stealing Reimu's food, as illustrated in ''[[Curiosities of Lotus Asia]]''.]]
Yukari has always had a close tie to the [[Hakurei Shrine]] maidens, as one meaning of her name is she controls the [[Shrine Maiden]]s of [[Gensokyo]]. [[Reimu Hakurei]], along with [[Marisa Kirisame]], first met Yukari when she asked her to repair the border between the [[Netherworld]] and [[Gensokyo]] in ''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]''. However, Yukari indicated she is already familiar with Reimu and Marisa to an unspecified extent. With Marisa, it resulted in Yukari playing a prank on her by keeping her up way past bedtime.

As a friend, she often visits Reimu at the Hakurei Shrine and often drops by Marisa's house randomly, to which in ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'' Marisa complains that Yukari never uses the door. Yukari steals food from Reimu in ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'', stays at Reimu's shrine for at least a month into the winter in ''[[Curiosities of Lotus Asia]]'', and is among several characters when Reimu complains about youkai visitors to her shrine in ''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]''. She sometimes visits to discuss philosophical matters like in ''[[Seasonal Dream Vision]]'', or ''[[Strange and Bright Nature Deity]]'' where she gave Reimu out-of-season taro roots from the [[Outside World|outside world]], asking her to think about their meaning.

As an employer, she's given Reimu several missions in ''[[Subterranean Animism]]'', ''[[Imperishable Night]]'' and ''[[Silent Sinner in Blue]]''. An offhand comment in the first stage of ''[[Imperishable Night]]'' shows she compensated Reimu for it.

As a mentor, she is often teaching Reimu not just about Gensokyo (she does that a lot, too, shown several times in ''[[Oriental Sacred Place]]'') but also how to do her job as [[Shrine Maiden]]. She shows up when Reimu purposefully damages the barrier in ''Curiosities of Lotus Asia'' to tell her not to do that, reminds Reimu of her youkai-crushing duties in ''Imperishable Night''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s extra, and makes Reimu train hard to prepare for ''[[Silent Sinner in Blue]]'' (''Curiosities of Lotus Asia'' states the latter is rare for her). The latter included Yukari attacking Reimu at unannounced times.

She seems to be secretly looking after Reimu in other ways, as she sneaks yen donations into the [[Hakurei Shrine]]'s donation offering box when Reimu isn't looking in chapter 23 of ''[[Strange and Bright Nature Deity]]''. Like most characters, Reimu finds Yukari extremely annoying. Yukari doesn't mind, clearly joking "How rude!" or "What a greeting!" to such things. In the case of ''Seasonal Dream Vision'' for Marisa, she got angry over Yukari's random visit, but it was because Yukari was curious as to Marisa's thoughts on the matter regarding the flower incident, so presumably many of Yukari's other visits to Marisa are for her own amusement, as well.

===[[Shikigami]]===
[[File:040BAiJRYukari.jpg|thumb|192px|Yukari smacking [[Ran Yakumo]], as illustrated in ''[[Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red]]''.]]
;[[Ran Yakumo]]
Ran Yakumo is Yukari's main [[shikigami]], a nine-tailed fox who received her current name and identity as part of their contract. An interview in ''[[Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red]]'' with [[Aya Shameimaru]] implies that she became Yukari's shikigami because of the power it promised, and is quite satisfied with the result despite losing her freedom. Ran was not born before the Genso-Lunar War, so she must have become Yukari's shikigami sometime after that.

Yukari keeps the relationship on a user-to-shikigami level. This relationship is analogous to a user and its computer in the [[Outside World]], and Yukari insists heavily that Ran is not a fox, but is a tool to be used. Yukari's own thoughts and perspective in [[Cage in Lunatic Runagate/Fifth Chapter|Chapter Five]] of ''[[Cage in Lunatic Runagate]]'' refers to Ran with computer terms, such as programming or debugging. Ran is still more advanced than a computer, so Yukari attempts philosophical discussion with Ran from time to time, but typically gets boring responses involving numbers and calculations. Yukari loves Ran very much, but in terms of how one would love a favorite tool.

Ran often "forgets" she is a shikigami, taking matters into her own hands without Yukari's orders. This can't be helped because Yukari sleeps a lot. Yukari will physically discipline Ran when this happens (by whacking her with her umbrella). Using a tool and keeping it in good shape (via discipline) shows love for your shikigami (according to Yukari). Ran accepts and seems satisfied with this, and also seems to care for her master, attempting to encourage Yukari after [[Silent Sinner in Blue|the second Genso-Lunar War]] failed. But she won't disagree that her master is annoying and is often driven to much frustration by Yukari's double-speak and secrecy. 

;[[Chen]]
Ran also has a [[shikigami]] named Chen. As Ran's shikigami, Chen follows the will of both [[Ran Yakumo]] and Yukari Yakumo, though her shikigami "programming" is not as unified with her original personality as Ran's is, and it's implied she's quite the handful as a result. Unlike Ran, Yukari views Chen as both Ran's shikigami and their pet, saying in ''[[Subterranean Animism]]'', "I wonder where our cat went off to? It's such a pain when she just suddenly disappears like that. I wish you'd take care to program your own familiar properly. Without any bugs."

Unlike Ran Yakumo, Chen is never called "Chen Yakumo", even when "Chen" and "Ran Yakumo" show up in the same sentence in ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Chen|Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]''.

;[[Yukari's crows]]
Zenki and Goki are two [[crow]]s that Yukari and Ran use as [[shikigami]]. They might be temporary names for all shikigami crows, as one gets killed by [[Watatsuki no Toyohime]], yet three more spy for Yukari later in [[Silent Sinner in Blue|Chapter 20]] of ''[[Silent Sinner in Blue]]''.

}}
;[[Yuyuko Saigyouji]]
Yukari and Yuyuko were friends even while Yuyuko was alive more than a thousand years ago, and continued to be Yuyuko's friend after she became a [[Ghost (Species)|ghost]]. Of note is that this friendship between Yuyuko and Yukari does not extend to Yukari's shikigami Ran, and Yuyuko does not mind others beating Ran up.

Yuyuko seems to be the only one who truly understands Yukari. Yukari knows this as well, often just assuming that Yuyuko knows what she's talking about or what's going on (this is clear whenever the two interact, including victory quotes). The two don't think exactly alike, however, which results in Yuyuko acting in ways that surprises Yukari. Yukari will do something just because Yuyuko asked and vice versa.

Yukari believed the [[Saigyou Ayakashi]] ate too many [[human]] lives. She was always aware that Yuyuko's body was sealing it. It's possible Yukari is the one who sealed it using Yuyuko's body, herself.

;[[Youmu Konpaku]]
Being Yuyuko's servant, Yukari helps Youmu with lessons and advice every once in a while, like in ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody/Story/Youmu's Scenario|Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]''.

===The Oni===
;[[Suika Ibuki]]
Yukari was Suika Ibuki's friend before the [[oni]] went underground. It is unknown how or when they became friends. Yukari looks out for Suika in ''[[Immaterial and Missing Power/Story/Yukari's Scenario|Immaterial and Missing Power]]'' and Suika does favors for Yukari, such as rebuilding the [[Hakurei Shrine]] in ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]'' or helping to investigate the underground. The two play [[danmaku]] battles with each other, though it's been a while since the last one before ''Scarlet Weather Rhapsody''. In ''[[Oriental Sacred Place]]'' Chapter 12, Yukari is with Suika at the Hakurei Shrine New Year's Festival.

Suika does get annoyed with Yukari's "dirty tricks", but doesn't go beyond snapping that they're dirty. Suika may know some of Yukari's secrets, as she's referred to Yukari's existence as fraudulent in ''[[Immaterial and Missing Power/Story/Suika's Scenario|Immaterial and Missing Power]]'', and stated to Yukari that it was rare to see her "on this side of the world" in broad daylight.

;[[Yuugi Hoshiguma]]
Yuugi is one of the [[oni]] (presumably Suika is another) that Yukari made a deal with. In exchange for keeping the [[Evil spirit|evil spirit]]s of former [[hell]] in control, Yukari would give them their own place in the [[Underworld]] and keep the overworld [[youkai]] from intruding. Unlike Suika, Yukari does not seem to have any personal attachments to Yuugi. As an aside, from Yukari's ''[[Immaterial and Missing Power]]'' ending, Yukari believes that if the oni ever do come back to [[Gensokyo]], it must be gradual instead of all oni coming back at once.

===Sages of Gensokyo===
;[[Kasen Ibaraki]]
It is unknown how long Yukari and Kasen have known each other, but both are [[youkai sages]]. The monologue in [[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]] states it was the youkai sages who proposed the Hakurei Barrier, so Yukari and Kasen probably knew each other since at least that time.

After Kasen came down from the mountain in the present day, Yukari assumed Kasen was always "on her side" and that Kasen's actions were intended to help Yukari's ideals. Kasen finally got fed up by the time of Wild and Horned Hermit Chapter 35 and angrily informed Yukari that she wasn't on her side. This caused Yukari a brief visible moment of distress before she regained her composure, but she also stated she would wait as long as it takes for Kasen to come to her side.

Kasen's dream self in [[Antinomy of Common Flowers]] calls Yukari a coward who gets others to do her work for her because she's too scared to do it herself.  As dream selves are unrestrained exaggerations of the real being, it is uncertain how much of this reflects Kasen's actual view of Yukari, but from Doremy's explanation of dream selves in Reisen's scenario, it does mean Kasen's normal feelings fall along those lines at least somewhat.

;[[Okina Matara]]
Another one of the [[youkai sages]]. It's implied in Reimu's extra stage in ''[[Hidden Star in Four Seasons]]'' that the two are familiar with each other, and that Yukari helped Reimu defeating Okina by suggesting her to use the "boundary between seasons" to fight her. Okina recognized Yukari's modus operandi, while Reimu said she didn't understand the logic behind the countermeasure method she was using. During the fire works festival that Usami wrote about in [[The Grimoire of Usami]], the two banter about things as equals.

===Residents of the [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]]===
;[[Remilia Scarlet]]
Yukari uses Remilia as part of her scheme to extract the residence tax and get revenge on the Lunarians in ''[[Silent Sinner in Blue]]''. Patchouli reveals Remilia knew she was manipulated but didn't care, because she was bored. Remilia herself has an unexplained rivalry of sorts with Yukari, wanting to get to the [[Moon]] in her own way before Yukari could to surprise her. This rivalry might be due to the power struggle mentioned in [[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Vampire|''Perfect Memento in Strict Sense''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Vampire article]], possibly starting with the vampire incident. The rivalry is mostly on Remilia's part, though Remilia has no objections to Yukari staying for the party at the end of ''Silent Sinner in Blue'' or assisting her with investigating in ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]''.

Dialogues in ''[[Immaterial and Missing Power]]'' seems to imply they've already known each other before that game. It is possible they met at the [[vampire]] incident, and that Yukari was the one that signed "the contract" with Remilia.

;[[Patchouli Knowledge]]
Patchouli first meets Yukari in her scenario in ''[[Immaterial and Missing Power]]''. In ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]'', Yukari places her in charge of watching the [[underworld]] in her victory quote to her. Patchouli later informs and urges her to act about the [[Evil spirit|evil spirit]]s coming out of the underground in ''[[Subterranean Animism]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s prologue. Yukari finally agrees to act because she "can't let them all just do whatever they want again". It is unknown (even to Patchouli) which incident Yukari is referring to (there are many possible ones). Patchouli continues to collaborate with Yukari regarding the underground, as she informs Yukari of the [[Myouren Temple|Palanquin Ship]] in a ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]'' victory quote.

===[[Eientei]] Residents===
Along with Reimu, Yukari confronted Eirin and [[Kaguya Houraisan]] to restore the full [[moon]] in ''[[Imperishable Night]]'', making Yukari one of the few characters who knows they're from the moon. After the incident was resolved and the moon restored, the girls all had a round of moon viewing sake with each other.

Unknown to each other, Eirin and Yukari's own history actually goes back further than that. As mentioned by [[Watatsuki no Toyohime]] at the end of chapter 17 of ''[[Silent Sinner in Blue]]'', one thousand years ago, Eirin set up a trap to catch someone who'd try to invade the moon. Yukari was well aware of the trap, apparently having already triggered it before (assuming her "make-believe" story in ''[[Cage in Lunatic Runagate]]'' actually happened). She seems to bear a grudge against the [[Lunarian]] sage (Eirin) that set it, referring to her as "the much-despised Lunarian sage".

However, Yukari hasn't realized who Eirin is. Neither of them make special note of each other in ''Imperishable Night'' and are amicable with each other in the ending. Near the end of ''Silent Sinner in Blue'', Yukari remarks to [[Ran Yakumo]] that she's unsure if "[[Eirin Yagokoro|the Brain of the Moon]]" had actually settled on Earth. Yukari suspects Eirin is a spy for the Moon.

The final chapter of ''Cage in Lunatic Runagate'' reveals that Yukari orchestrated the events primarily to teach Eirin to fear the unknown, likely because those who live as [[human]]s in [[Gensokyo]] are supposed to fear the [[youkai]] (as stated in Yukari's lecture to Ran earlier about the aliens).

===Minor Relationships===
;[[Rinnosuke Morichika]]
Yukari and Rinnosuke mostly have business arrangements. In exchange for fuel for his kerosene fan heater, Yukari takes merchandise she likes and occasionally provides information on items. While he is grateful, Rinnosuke also doesn't like dealing with her all that much and makes note of how ominous she seems. Although he can't remember it, Yukari once prevented Rinnosuke from being spirited away to the [[Outside World]].

;[[Eiki Shiki, Yamaxanadu]]
When Yukari senses Eiki approaching in ''[[Seasonal Dream Vision]]'', she and Yuyuko leave immediately to avoid talking with her. ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Eiki Shiki, Yamaxanadu|Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'' notes that most long-lived [[youkai]] were assisted by Eiki at least once and avoid her due to her lectures.

;[[Alice Margatroid]]
For whatever reason, Alice Margatroid is willing to confront Yukari in ''[[Immaterial and Missing Power]]'' despite otherwise avoiding strong youkai such as [[Remilia Scarlet]] and [[Yuyuko Saigyouji]]. Yukari's also set up Alice's [[doll]]s off-page to allow for long-range communications in ''[[Subterranean Animism]]''. Her dialogue towards Yukari in ''[[Immaterial and Missing Power]]'' shows that they knew each other before then. Like most characters, Alice is still suspicious of Yukari by default. Alice is aware of various youkai roles and agreements that Yukari is constantly preaching. Yukari also harshly scolds Alice in Alice's second bad ending in ''Immaterial and Missing Power'', much to everyone else's entertainment.

;[[Keine Kamishirasawa]]
Yukari and Keine met and fought at the [[Human Village]] in ''[[Imperishable Night]]''. Keine's ability to hide history has no effect on Yukari, who didn't even know she was using her ability in the first place. It is unexplained why, but history and reality are mentioned regarding Yukari so often that there are many possible reasons. Yukari also disliked Keine for being a human-faced beast.

;[[Three Fairies of Light]]
Yukari met the Three Fairies of Light in a continuation of chapter 0 in ''[[Eastern and Little Nature Deity]]'' chapter 5, asking if she could join in on their pranks. They ran away from her. Later, in ''[[Strange and Bright Nature Deity]]'', Yukari needed to repair a tree that was part of the [[Great Hakurei Barrier]]. She did so by moving the three fairies into it, but only after testing that they were too weak to cause serious trouble. They failed the test with flying colors, so Yukari let them move in. Sunny's ability to reflect some of Yukari's [[danmaku]] did impress her a bit.

==Spell Cards==
From various descriptions of Yukari's spell cards, many of her danmaku consists of light attacks, concentrated spirit power (for her manjis according to ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]'' and assuredly her butterflies in Sinister Spirits: "Double Black Death Butterfly"), or even just attacking with [[boundary|boundaries]] and [[gap]]s. Her ability to transport objects via gaps also allows her to use almost any physical object as danmaku, including road signs and even an abandoned runaway train. Attacking with her parasol is not out of the question, and she sometimes uses her shikigami [[Ran Yakumo]] and Ran's shikigami [[Chen]] as projectiles (that can fire danmaku of their own) for her spell cards. Some of the names and descriptions from ''[[The Grimoire of Marisa]]'' for her spell cards implies she's capable of attacking with metaphorical concepts.

==Additional Information==
*A silhouette of Yukari occupies the front of ''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s jewel case. Yukari also appears on the case of ''[[Immaterial and Missing Power OST]]''.
*For some reason, Yukari's appearance in spell card 222 in ''[[Imperishable Night]]'' is different from other characters. Instead of using her protrait from ''Imperishable Night'', a modified image from ''Perfect Cherry Blossom'' was used (she has blue ribbons instead). What is more strange is that the background used in the [[spell card]], which is also from ''Perfect Cherry Blossom'', uses Yukari's original cut-in image with red ribbons, although the three [[Shoot the Bullet|scene]]-[[Impossible Spell Card|based]] [[Violet Detector|games]] she appears in also use this. Yukari's sprite in the three scene-based games she appears in also sports blue ribbons. 
*She is the only Phantasm boss in the whole of the ''[[Touhou Project]]''. Her status as "8th boss", however, is matched by [[Fujiwara no Mokou]] (stage 6B being stage 7 and Extra being stage 8 in ''[[Imperishable Night]]'''s game files), [[Komachi Onozuka]] and exceeded by [[Eiki Shiki, Yamaxanadu|Eiki Shiki]] (''[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]'' having 9 stages); [[Reimu Hakurei]] can also become a stage 8 or 9 boss in ''[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]'' (if playing as Komachi or Eiki respectively) or a stage 8 boss in ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]'' (if playing as [[Tenshi Hinanawi]]).
*In ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]'' and ''[[Antinomy of Common Flowers]]'' one of Yukari's spell card spawns a train to mow her opponent down. The graphic of the train is based on an actual existing train {{lang|ja|[[wikipedia:ja:長野電鉄3500系・3600系電車|長野電鉄木島線3500系]]}} ([[wikipedia:Nagano Electric Railway|Nagano Electric Railway]] Kijima line 3500 series), a train used to run in Nagano: [[ZUN]]'s homeland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dic.nicovideo.jp/a/ぶらり廃駅下車の旅 {{lang|ja|ぶらり廃駅下車の旅 - ニコニコ大百科}}] the Nicopedia page of her spell card "Abandoned Line 'Aimless Journey to the Abandoned Station'" (Japanese).&lt;/ref&gt;
*In [[Antinomy of Common Flowers]], Yukari has an alternate color palette that resembles [[Ran Yakumo]]'s color scheme, one that resembles [[Patchouli Knowledge]]'s, another resembling [[Yuyuko Saigyouji]]'s  with Ran and Chen resembling [[Youmu Konpaku]], and another that resembles [[Lunasa Prismriver]]'s.
*Both Yukari and Ran's surname was "Suzukaze" in the trial version ver. 0.09a of [[PCB]].&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/agagasoso/status/631132995148066817&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mastermind behind the Spiriting Away'''&lt;br/&gt;
'''Yukari Yakumo'''

The [[youkai]] of [[boundary|boundaries]], who awakens at spring.&lt;br/&gt;
Mainly, she possesses the ability to manipulate all sorts of boundaries.

She and [[Yuyuko Saigyouji|Yuyuko]] have known each other for a long time, but Yukari is not a [[Phantom|phantom]]. She lives in the remotest place in [[Gensokyo]]. Her lifestyle involves a lot of staring at the [[Hakurei Border]].

When [[human]]s from the outer world wander into Gensokyo, it's all thanks to fluctuations in the boundary caused by Yukari. There is an enchanting element about the phenomenon which people like to call "Spirited Away"; if it is ever discovered that spiriting away is not the work of gods, but the meddling of a youkai girl, the term will lose all of its mystique.

Yukari usually doesn't act on her own, preferring instead to have [[Ran Yakumo|Ran]] handle the details of daily life. But, since she is almost always asleep, she has no idea what Ran does while she sleeps.

When she heard that Ran had been defeated by someone, she became mildly surprised before going back to sleep.

After waking up from her nap, she finally noticed that spring had graced her place of residence. The truth is that spring had been around for the past 10 days, but she forgot it whenever she went to bed and woke up just as surprised the next time.

She couldn't sleep carelessly until Ran fully recovered, but she opted to sleep on the problem.

The next time she woke up, she received a request from Yuyuko asking her to restore the boundary between the world of the living and the [[Netherworld|world of the dead]]. It was a ridiculous request since Yuyuko was the one who weakened it to begin with, so Yukari rubbed the sleep from her eyes and set out for repairs.

It had been quite a while since Yukari's last visit to the [[Netherworld]], and she was curious to see that it was bustling with excitement. She thought the Saigyouji family were more quiet, laid-back folks, but she shrugged and decided Yuyuko had just had a change in taste.

She met the gardener, [[Youmu Konpaku|Youmu]], along the way and heard about the situation. Youmu admitted that they seemed to be in quite a mess, but it sounded like well-earned punishment to Yukari.


Everyone always seemed to be bent out of shape about [[Saigyou Ayakashi|that youkai cherry tree]], and nothing else. Surely, it had drained the life out of so many humans. Yukari knew it was dangerous. However, she realized there was nothing she could do about it.

Yukari had known Yuyuko since before her death. She also knew that it was ''not'' Yuyuko who was sealed by the Saigyou Ayakashi...

:... but that it was ''Yuyuko's body that was sealing the Saigyou Ayakashi''.

'''Border of Phantasm'''&lt;br/&gt;
'''Yukari Yakumo'''

Species: [[Youkai]]&lt;br/&gt;
Location: Unknown&lt;br/&gt;
Ability: Manipulate boundaries

A youkai living in [[Gensokyo]]. As these letters (妖怪) tell, she is dubious and suspicious. It's said that she lives in a mansion located at the edge of Gensokyo, but nobody knows where it really is. For some reason she knows a lot about the [[outside world]] too.&lt;br/&gt;
That makes her very suspicious.

Her personality is hardly understandable, but everyone agrees that it's not something pleasant. Many people don't want to meet her, if possible. Usually, she doesn't attack anyone directly, except for who is equally strong as [[Reimu Hakurei|Reimu]].

Her fighting style is completely different from a [[human]]'s measure. It's neither fast nor heavy-hitting. It is uncertain whether she is really tough or not. Her attitude makes you think as if you're being teased by her, which is really irritating even if you manage to defeat her.

However, no one can match her in sincerely caring about Gensokyo, and loving it with all her heart.

'''Youkai of Boundaries, Yukari Yakumo'''&lt;br/&gt;
A [[youkai]] living at the edge of [[Gensokyo]].&lt;br/&gt;
She possess the ability manipulate boundaries. It is uncertain how long she has been alive, but her existence at least predates the history of Gensokyo itself.&lt;br/&gt;
Her personality is hard to understand; unlike other long-lived entities, she displays none of the bitterness commonly associated with old age. She is difficult to approach, but that's due more to her deviousness than any uneasy feeling that people may have around her.&lt;br/&gt;
She owns one [[shikigami]], and lets her shikigami do all her daily chores for her. Yukari herself always leads an easy life. From [[Ran Yakumo|that shikigami]]'s perspective, it's like her master is holding her hostage, so it's quite maddening.&lt;br/&gt;
The danger and potency of the power to manipulate boundaries is beyond imagination. In order to wield it, you'd have to either be a somewhat-weird [[youkai]] like Yukari, or someone who can withstand the power's pressure.

Her weapon is her [[shikigami]]. (Basically treated like a tool.)

:''Notes''
:She teams up with [[Reimu Hakurei|Reimu]] this time.
:Normal speed only applies when she's used as a solo character.
:As in daily life, she leaves all the work to her [[shikigami]]. Once locked on to a target, [[Ran Yakumo|her shikigami]] pursues and attacks it until either Yukari stops shooting or the target falls.
:Be aware that you must move in front of an enemy to acquire a target lock.
:Recommended for players who believe that a laid-back life is best.

'''Youkai that lurks in the boundary'''&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
'''Yukari Yakumo'''

Species: [[Youkai]]&lt;br/&gt;
Ability: Manipulating boundaries

She lives somewhere on the boundary between [[Gensokyo]] and the outer world.
Since most people can't see the border, no one is certain exactly where she lives. They know only that she does not live near the [[Hakurei Shrine]], which is also located on the boundary.

Among the youkai in Gensokyo, she has lived ever since the ancient times and is very powerful.
Nowadays, she is one of the few youkai that know a lot about Gensokyo.
She is seen as devious, but that's mainly because she has low quality of a human, so others find her actions quite difficult to comprehend.
She is also a dangerous youkai, with easily enough power to destroy all of Gensokyo if necessary.

Species: youkai&lt;br/&gt;
Ability: Manipulating boundaries

A youkai who comes and goes where she pleases; no-one ever seems to know where she is.&lt;br/&gt;
This time, she's made yin-yang orbs that let you talk to her.

Since the underground youkai have built up a society separate from that of the youkai above ground, she doesn't seem to want to interfere. The sudden appearance of the vengeful spirits puzzled her. She didn't want it to turn into some major event, so she sent Reimu, who had relatively little influence on things, to investigate.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1157">In ''[[Touhou Bougetsushou]]'', [[Yukari Yakumo]] employs a number of crow [[shikigami]] for surveillance - two of these are named {{nihongo|'''Zenki'''|前鬼||"front oni"}} and {{nihongo|'''Goki'''|後鬼||"rear oni"}}, while the others are left unnamed. She apparently pays them a wage, as she rewards them for performing errands by promising to increase their bonus. The crows resemble normal animals, though they move with a mechanical precision that can be recognised by those familiar with shikigami.
One of these shikigami was sent to spy on the [[Moon]] during ''[[Cage in Lunatic Runagate]]'', only to be killed when [[Watatsuki no Toyohime]] transported it to the airless Near Side.

==Trivia==
* Zenki and Goki are common names for a pair of [[oni]] servants, famously used by the onmyoji [[wikipedia:Abe no Seimei|Abe no Seimei]], as well as by [[wikipedia:En no Gyōja|En no Gyōja]] the founder of Shugendo.
** Ran references a Zenki and Goki in her [[spell card]] ''Shikigami "Protection of Zenki and Goki"'', used in the Phantasm Stage of ''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]''.

{{nihongo|'''Yuki'''|ユキ}} is a [[Magician|Witch]] who resides in [[Makai]]. Together with [[Mai]] she serves as one of two bosses in the fourth stage of ''[[Mystic Square]]''.

==Character Basis==
===Name===
In contrast to her abilities with fire, the Japanese word {{nihongo|"Yuki"|ユキ}} means "snow".

===Design===
Yuki's design shows that she has yellow eyes, yellow hair, and wears a dark red hat with a pink ribbon. She also wears a dark red and pink dress.
 
==Appearances==
===PC-98===
;''Mystic Square''
:{{Main|Mystic Square/Story|l1=Mystic Square Story}}
When the heroine traveled into Makai during the events of ''[[Mystic Square]]'', Yuki and [[Mai]] were waiting for her. Together they attempted to prevent the heroine from going any further into Makai, but ultimately failed. Yuki is the more vocal of the two.

===Project Blank===
{{project blank note|section}}
[[File:SMDYuki.png|frame|Sprite of Yuki in ''[[Samidare]]''.]]
Yuki and [[Mai]] made an appearance as the second midbosses of the Extra Stage in ''[[Samidare]]'', similar to their boss battle in ''[[Mystic Square]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s fourth stage. This appearance is unofficial, as [[ZUN]] had no involvement in the development of the game; Yoko (blankvision), one of the members of "[[Shunsatsu sare do?]]" and [[RebRank]] were responsible for their appearance. Yuki's design has not changed from that used in ''[[Mystic Square]]'', save for her being encapsulated in a red sphere of light. Furthermore, she and her partner's second attack in this appearance looks very similar to [[Alice Margatroid]]'s second attack in ''Mystic Square''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Extra Stage.

==Relationships==
===Mai===
[[Mai]] is a Witch like Yuki, and it is possible that the two are friends. During the fourth stage of ''[[Mystic Square]]'', Yuki will become enraged if Mai is defeated before her.

===Minor Relationships===
;Shinki
[[Shinki]] is the creator of [[Makai]] and everything within it. In light of this, Shinki may also have created Yuki.

==Additional Information==
*She bears a striking resemblance to [[Windows]] era [[Marisa Kirisame]].
*Despite [[Mai]]'s claim that she is stronger than Yuki, her in-game bullet patterns are less complex and easier to deal with than Yuki's patterns.

{{nihongo|'''Yumemi Okazaki'''|岡崎　夢美|Okazaki Yumemi}} is a college professor searching for the mysterious power of magic so that she can study it and bring her findings back to the scientific community. When she arrives in [[Gensokyo]], her ship, the [[Probability Space Hypervessel]], is mistaken for some ordinary ruins by the inhabitants. She attempts to kidnap the heroine to use her as a research subject, but is ultimately defeated and sent home empty-handed. Yumemi is unfamiliar with both the magical and religious matters of Gensokyo, so she refers to [[Reimu Hakurei]]'s power as magic, even when Reimu insists that it's actually divine power.

It is implied that her world of origin may not be the [[outside world]] as we know it, due to her profile and that of Chiyuri's, which suggests that a grand unified theory has been established, and there are 13 year-olds graduating from graduate school. Of note, however, is that in [[Magical Astronomy]], which takes place in the future of the [[outside world]], Maribel mentions that gravity was unified with the other forces recently, which could mean the grand unified theory has been established in the outside world.

==Character Design==
===Name===
"Yumemi" means "beautiful dream". "Okazaki" is a common Japanese surname meaning "mountain".

Her name "Yumemi" might be inspired from not one, or two, but three characters - '''Yumimi''' Yoshizawa (Yumimi Mix), Sayori '''Oka'''jima (Sayori na Parallel) and Marian E'''zaki''' (Apple Paradise). All three of them have red hair and braids, and their stories involves all kinds of mysteries, the most notable is traveling through parallel worlds.

It may also be a reference to the Japanese biologist [[wikipedia:Reiji Okazaki|Reiji Okazaki]] or the [[wikipedia:Okazaki Fragments|Okazaki Enzyme]].

===Design===
Yumemi's design shows that she has red eyes and dark red hair, with a matching dark red cape, vest, cloth shoulders and skirt. Also has a white shirt and bright red bow tie. Her alternate outfit is the same, except her hair is blond and her eyes are yellow, her dress and cape is black with purple trimmings on her dress and the cloths on her shoulders as well. Her cape has a red trim and her bow is red, but when she is casting a special attack, her bow tie is purple instead.

In ''[[Phantasmagoria of Dim.Dream]]'', she is the final enemy the player encounters. Because Chiyuri was spreading misinformation, Yumemi promises to grant the player a wish should they win, both out of confidence and out of an apology for her assistant's behavior. When she loses, she nearly pulls out a bomb powerful enough to destroy the entire world, but is stopped by Chiyuri. She then proceeds to grant the player's wish.

In Yumemi's own story, after successfully defeating all other opponents, she comes inside the [[Probability Space Hypervessel]], only to almost be attacked by Chiyuri; after reprimanding her for this, they are then approached by a third individual -- a clone of Yumemi created by Chiyuri while she was messing with the ship's controls. After punishing Chiyuri again, Yumemi then engages in a battle for superiority with her clone that she wins.

After all the events of ''Phantasmagoria of Dim.Dream'' have ended, Yumemi is kicked out of the university she taught at for presenting a theory of magic. Yumemi and Chiyuri then return to [[Gensokyo]], and it is implied that they are still there.

==Relationships==
===Chiyuri Kitashirakawa===
[[Chiyuri Kitashirakawa]] is an assistant of Yumemi.

===Minor Relationships===
;Ruukoto
[[Ruukoto]] is a former [[maid]] of Yumemi and is Yumemi's creation. She is now owned by [[Reimu Hakurei]] in the [[PC-98]]. It's unknown if Reimu owns her in current ''[[Touhou Project]]''.
;Mimi-chan
[[Mimi-chan]] is a weapon and a creation of Yumemi's. She is now owned by [[Marisa Kirisame]] in the [[PC-98]]. It's unknown if Marisa owns her in current ''Touhou Project''.

==Additional Information==
*Yumemi appears on the cover of ''[[Phantasmagoria of Dim.Dream]]'' along with all the other characters in that game.
*She's one of the few [[PC-98]] characters who has a full in-game portrait, which appears when she is casting a special attack.
*She is one of the two final bosses who is a [[human]], along with [[Sumireko Usami]]. Yumemi however is the only final boss without any kind of innate power or magic.

She teaches comparative physics at a university.  She doesn't look like it, but she's already 18, which is quite young to be a professor.  In Yumemi's world, all the forces such as gravity, electromagnetism, and atomic power have been resolved under a [[w:Theory of everything|unified theory]], which has been proven to explain all known forces in the world.  Yumemi believes there may be a force that doesn't fit in this theory - "magic".  However, when she announced her theory to the academic community, she became a laughing stock.&lt;br/&gt;

'''YuugenMagan''' is the first being that [[Reimu Hakurei]] encounters in [[Makai]] during ''[[Highly Responsive to Prayers]]'' after passing through the gate to Makai. Like other bosses in the game, there is little to no information regarding this enemy.

==Character Design==

===Origin===
The [[wikipedia:Evil eye|evil eye]] is a widespread concept among many cultures with the common focal point being that a malevolent stare or look can act as a curse. In Japanese, the most common term for evil eye is 邪視 (''jashi''). The [[wikipedia:Judaism|Judaic]] angel of death, [[wikipedia:Sariel|Sariel]], is associated with evil eyes and is said to be able to ward them off. Due to the appearance of [[Sariel]] in the game and [[Makai]] itself containing numerous references to [[wikipedia:Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic]] imagery, YuugenMagan is most likely based off of the [https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.myjewishlearning.com/article/evil-eye-in-judaism/amp Jewish concept] of evil eyes.

===Name===
Like most characters in the ''Highly Responsive to Prayers'', YuugenMagan doesn't have an official kanji spelling. Its name is written  just rendered "YuugenMagan" in-game. Two possible spellings are "{{lang|ja|幽玄魔眼}}" and "{{lang|ja|幽幻魔眼}}". ''Magan'' (魔眼 lit. "magical/demon's eye") is roughly equivalent to  [[wikipedia:Evil eye|"evil eye"]]. "Yuugen" interpreted as {{lang|ja|幽玄}} means "simple and elegant/subtlely graceful/profoundly mysterious/mystic/etc". The word also refers to the [[wikipedia:occult|occult]], which is the most likely meaning in this case as YuugenMagan has five evil eyes surrounding it. ZUN used the kanji 幽玄 before on the theme title {{nihongo|"Eternal Dream ~ Mystical Maple|'''幽玄'''の槭樹}}. Using this interpretation, "YuugenMagan" would translate to "Occult Evil/Demon Eyes" or "Mystic Evil/Demon Eyes".

{{lang|ja|幽幻}} is not a legitimately established term in Japanese, so, if interpreted as this, it's likely to come from {{nihongo||'''幽幻'''道士|Yuugen Doushi}} (original title {{lang|zh|殭屍小子}}): an action horror comedy movie made in Taiwan starring a [[Jiang Shi]] as the heroine. Again, an example of ZUN using this word before exists in the form of the theme title {{nihongo|"Eastern Record of the Sealing of a Demon ~ A Phantom's Boisterous Dance"|東方封魔録 ～ '''幽幻'''乱舞}}. Using this interpretation, "YuugenMagan" would translate to "Phantom Evil/Demon Eyes".

===Design===
YuuganMagan is a hovering set of five independently-moving eyes, connected by an electric-like force and surrounded by strange markings. At the center lies what appears to be an outline or projection of a character in a [[wikipedia:kimono|kimono]]. This being seems to be the source or controller of the eyes.

==Relationships==
===Minor Relationship===
;Shinki
[[Shinki]] is the creator of [[Makai]] and everything within it. In light of this, Shinki may also have created YuugenMagan.

==Additional Information==
*YuugenMagan is boss with the most [[hit box]]es in the series that all affect the same health bar. Coming in second place would be the [[Prismriver Sisters]] in ''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]''.
*YuugenMagan and [[Mima]] share the same theme in ''Highly Responsive to Prayers'', "Angel's Legend".
**The theme's title might reference the angel [[wikipedia:Sariel|Sariel]], who is said to be associated with evil eyes according to [[wikipedia:Kabbalah|kabbalic]] texts.
*The kanji "{{lang|ja|邪}}", meaning "wicked/evil", appears in the background during YuugenMagan's battle. 
*[[Byakuren Hijiri]]'s lotus aura seems to be a reference to YuugenMagan's evil eyes. The two share a similar presentation and shoot similar danmaku patterns. This, of course, makes sense as Byakuren, like YuugenMagan, appears in [[Makai]].
*YuugenMagan's eyes appear to come out of purple magic circles that each contain a [[wikipedia:Star of David|Star of David]] within them. 
*YuugenMagan's final attack phase involves the evil eyes summoning a [[wikipedia:Pentagram|pentacle]] that shoots danmaku and, eventually, itself.
**The pentacle (or pentagram) could represent many things including magic, the occult, and the ''seiman'' symbol of [[wikipedia:Onmyoudou|Onmyoudou]]. The Chinese concept of [[Wikipedia:Wu Xing|Wu Xing]] (五行 lit. "Five Elements") is usually represented in a diagram connected by a pentacle. During YuugenMagan's fight, the background displaying the 邪 (evil) kanji constantly changes color. All of the colors on the background can correspond to Wu Xing elements. Black and blue to water, indigo to metal, red and orange to fire, purple and yellow to earth, and green to wood.
***Pentacles used for magic often feature [[Wikipedia:Magic square|magic squares]] in their pentagonal center. ''[[Mystic Square]]'', a game that heavily features Makai, is named after the magic square. [[Sara]], the gatekeeper of Makai in ''Mystic Square'', directly references the concept in her theme's title, "Magic Square".
*In ''[[Story of Eastern Wonderland]]'', enemy [[evil eye]]s make their debut along with a giant, artifical evil eye tank known as [[Evil Eye Σ]] created by the engineer [[Rika]].

{{nihongo|'''Yuugi Hoshiguma'''|星熊 勇儀|Hoshiguma Yuugi}} is an [[oni]] currently living in the [[Ancient City]], which is in the [[Underworld]]. She has an unexplainable ability. She was once one of the [[Big Four of the Mountain]], along with [[Suika Ibuki]], and she lives alongside many other oni that were forced below ground.

==General Information==
Yuugi first appears as the [[stage]] 3 [[boss]] and midboss of ''[[Subterranean Animism]]'', which is quite suprising for an [[oni]], and was a target on stage 6 of ''[[Double Spoiler]]''. She made a cameo appearance as one of the many background [[characters]] in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'', but made an appearace in [[Marisa Kirisame]]'s ending.

===Personality===
Yuugi is a very firm and straightforward oni. She likes those who are strong and brave, and has no mercy for the weak and cowardly.

===Abilities===
; Strength 
Yuugi possesses enormous strength that far exceeds that of any other kind of youkai. She has arguably the greatest super-strength, as even Suika, that was considered the strongest in this sense by the time of ''[[Silent Sinner in Blue]]'', admits that Yuugi might be physically stronger than she is. In ''[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]]'', it is said that, according to rumors ''"her superhuman strength is of the level where her footsteps alone are enough to make nearby buildings collapse"''. She has also shown to be able to [[Double Spoiler/Spell Cards/Level 6#Spell Card 6 - 3|easily produce heat]] by raising her hand, and flatten trees [[Double Spoiler/Spell Cards/Level 6#Spell Card 6 - 7|merely by screaming]].

;Wield unexplainable phenomena
{{nihongo|Anomalies, strength, disorder, and spirits|怪力乱神|kai-ryoku-ran-shin}} is a metaphor for unexplainable phenomena that originates from the ''[[Wikipedia:Analects|Analects]]'' of [[Wikipedia:Confucius|Confucius]], where one of his disciples said {{nihongo|"the Master never talked of anomalies, strength, disorder, or spirits."|子不語怪力亂神|shifugo-kairiki-ranshin}} Furthermore, Yuugi's title is "the so-called unexplainable phenomenon".

More accurately, Confucius did not talk about unnatural things ({{nihongo|strangeness|怪異}}), mysterious powers ({{nihongo|courage|勇力}}), things contrary to reason ({{nihongo|devious rebellion|悖乱}}), and strange things related to [[god]] ({{nihongo|fierce god|鬼神}}). In other words, {{nihongo|"strangeness"|'''怪'''異}}, {{nihongo|"courage"|勇'''力'''}}, {{nihongo|"devious rebellion"|悖'''乱'''}}, and {{nihongo|"fierce god"|鬼'''神'''}} are why "{{lang|ja|怪力乱神}}" is referred to as "anomalies, strength, disorder, and spirits." It's appropriately unclear what exactly this ability allows Yuugi to do, since the ability itself is a metaphor for things that cannot be explained.

Her very name, {{nihongo|"Yuugi"|'''勇'''儀}}, might've come from the {{nihongo|courage|'''勇'''力}} that's represented as "strength" in "anomalies, strength, disorder, and spirits."

===Occupation===
Yuugi spends her time in [[Former Hell]], fraternizing with the other oni, engaging in frequent drinking contests and generally having a rowdy time.

===Possessions===
Yuugi carries a sake dish called the "Hoshiguma Dish". It raises the quality of any sake poured into it. [[Kasen Ibaraki]] later uses this to transform some of her own sake for a party at the [[Hakurei Shrine]]. The dish itself is considered a masterwork of the oni.

==Backstory==
Yuugi was one of the many [[youkai]] and [[oni]] who moved into the [[Underworld]] in [[Hell]] when [[Gensokyo]] first became isolated from the [[Outside World]]. She and the others didn't wish to be chained to the rules that were set up, and decided to move down there. Though a non-aggression pact had apparently been negotiated, Yuugi realized that she wasn't enjoying spending time with [[human]]s, so she took up residence in [[Former Hell]] to be with kindred spirits. They built their own society and lived there, in isolation, for a really long time.

==Character Design==
[[File:ThGKYuugi.png|thumb|175px|Illustration of Yuugi in ''[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]]'']]
===Name===
{{nihongo|''Yuugi Hoshiguma''|星熊 勇儀}} is her full name. The characters of {{nihongo|''Hoshiguma''|星熊}} mean {{nihongo|"star"|星}} and {{nihongo|"bear"|熊}}. The characters in {{nihongo|''Yuugi''|勇儀}} mean {{nihongo|"bravery"|勇}} and {{nihongo|"ritual"|儀}}. As said in the [[#Ability|Ability]]'s section, "Yuugi" could've come from {{nihongo|courage|'''勇'''力}}.

In the legend of [[Wikipedia:Shuten-dōji|Shuten Douji]], a particularly vicious oni who lived atop Mt. Ooeyama, one of Shuten Douji's four strongman [[demon]]s was named Hoshiguma Douji. This may or may not be related to Yuugi's concept.

===Design===
Yuugi has long, straight blonde hair, red eyes, and a single red horn coming out of her forehead. She wears a white, short-sleeved shirt with red trim at the cuffs, neck, and bottom and a dark blue semi-transparent skirt with red highlights and trim. Her wrists and ankles are manacled, with short, broken chains attached to the manacles. In the same interview as mentioned above, the interviewer mentions that her clothes look kind of like a gym uniform and that it'd be easy to do exercises in them. Following that, ZUN also said that Yuugi's skirt actually was semi-transparent.&lt;ref name="Interview in Cara☆Mel"&gt;[http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm5903008 Interview on Subterranean Animism with Cara☆Mel‎] (Nico Nico Video link)&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'' and later ''[[Touhou Gouyoku Ibun]]'', Yuugi wears a light blue [[Wikipedia:Yukata|Yukata]] with a purple ''obi'', an outfit previously seen in an unofficial promotional flyer for ''[[Subterranean Animism]]'' by [[alphes]]. Additionally, in ''Touhou Gouyoku Ibun'' her hair is tied into a ponytail with a blue ribbon (revealing pointed ears), and she carries a jug emblazoned with the kanji for ''sake'' (酒).

When the heroine arrives at the Ancient City in [[Stage]] 3 of ''[[Subterranean Animism]]'', Yuugi rushes out to meet her. After Yuugi's initial attack is repelled, she promises to lead the heroine to the [[Palace of the Earth Spirits]] in exchange for giving her a good fight.

[[File:Th175YuugiSprite.gif|thumb|frame|left|90px|Yuugi's sprite in ''GI'']]
In ''[[Double Spoiler]]'', Yuugi used a few [[spell card]]s and had [[Aya Shameimaru]] and [[Hatate Himekaidou]] taking photos of her and her [[danmaku]].

;''Hopeless Masquerade''
[[File:Th135Yuugi&amp;Suika.png|thumb|Yuugi with Suika in ''HM'']]
Yuugi made a background cameo appearance in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'' on the [[Human Village]] stage. She is seen standing on a balcony of the tavern with [[Suika Ibuki]], drinking sake. Also in [[Marisa Kirisame]]'s ending, she comes back the day after the incident is resolved, and sounds somewhat disappointed that the battles are over.

;''Touhou Gouyoku Ibun''
Yuugi greets the heroine in the [[Hot Spring Town]] and explains that the "black water" is called "petroleum" in the surface, and that she heard rumors about obtaining a great wealth with it, but also misfortune. After saying that it's from a place that not even them can reach, she decides to attack the heroine after knowing she wants to investigate anyways.

If the player chooses to use [[Flandre Scarlet]], Yuugi will attack the vampire without an aparent reason.
===Literature===
; Wild and Horned Hermit 
In chapter 16 of ''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'', Yuugi lends the Hoshiguma Dish to [[Kasen Ibaraki]], so that she can raise the quality of the sake that she is going to bring to the flower-viewing party. She also informs [[Suika Ibuki]] about Kasen acting as a hermit.

==Relationships==
;[[Suika Ibuki]] 
Yuugi is old friends with Suika, and presumably with the other two [[Big Four of the Mountain]].

;[[Kasen Ibaraki]]
Kasen describes Yuugi as an acquaintance of hers in ''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'' when she used the oni's sake dish to make her own sake better.

==Additional Information==
*Like other oni, Yuugi is ridiculously strong and, in turn, likes strong people. She also enjoys drinking heavily and raising a ruckus.
*Yuugi Hoshiguma is thus far the only [[boss]] who stays around after her mid-boss defeat and remains in front of the player throughout the end of the stage, unless you count [[Mystia Lorelei]] and [[Nemuno Sakata]], who begin the end-of-[[stage]] battle immediately after the mid-boss fight.
*In the interview about Yuugi, ZUN mentions that her act of not spilling a drop of sake is reminiscent of Jonathan from Jojo; although he further adds the two characters are unrelated.
*According to an interview in [[Cara☆Mel‎]] for ''[[Cage in Lunatic Runagate]]'' 7, [[ZUN]] said the theme behind Yuugi was to make an energetic, oni-like oni, since there would be lots of oni in hell.&lt;ref name="Interview in Cara☆Mel" /&gt;

Various [[youkai]] live here, though the oni are the most representative group among them all.&lt;br/&gt;
The oni left the overworld voluntarily when humans began to shun them, and built up a new society on Hell's excess plots of land.

The oni were proactive in accepting even those youkai who have become hated in the overworld.&lt;br/&gt;
The youkai from above, who felt out of place and in danger, accepted their control over the underground on one condition.

That condition was to seal the vengeful spirits of hell. In return, the youkai from the overworld promised not to enter the underground city.

The oni have now cut off all communication with the overworld, and have settled into a new society
completely unknown to humans.


As one would expect from an oni, Yuugi enjoys every day by drinking and raising a ruckus.&lt;br/&gt;
When she heard some strong humans had appeared, she rushed out while she is still drunk...

{{nihongo|'''Yuuka Kazami'''|風見　幽香|Kazami Yuuka}} is a long-lived [[youkai]] called the "Flower Master of the Four Seasons" whose main place of activity is the [[Garden of the Sun]], a field completely covered in sunflowers. She loves seasonal flowers, so throughout the year she moves to the respective places where the flowers grow: spring flowers for spring, summer flowers for summer, autumn flowers for autumn and sometimes winter flowers for winter.

{{TOC limit|n=3}}
==General Information==
Yuuka made her first ever appearance in the fourth [[PC-98]] ''[[Touhou Project]]'' game ''[[Lotus Land Story]]'' as both the fifth [[stage]] [[boss]] and the final boss. She then appeared as a playable character in ''[[Mystic Square]]''. Afterwards, she reappeared as a playable character in the ninth work ''[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]''. Additionally, she has made a guest appearance as an unlockable character in the ''[[Seihou Project]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s second game, ''[[Kioh Gyoku]]''.

Yuuka is a caretaker of flowers of all seasons, likened to a force of nature holding tremendous power. She is presumed to be very old given her demeanor and knowledge of the causes behind the Great Barrier Incident of Sixty Years. Her main place of activity is the Garden of the Sun. She used to reside in [[Mugenkan]], the mansion at the boundary between Gensokyo and the [[Fantasy World]], guarded by two gatekeepers - [[Elly]] and possibly [[Kurumi]].

===Personality===
[[File:Th135Yuuka.gif|frame|left|Yuuka in ''[[HM]]'']]

Yuuka is a troublesome and playful youkai. She holds strength in high regard and likes to look down on and toy with those weaker than her. She's sharp-witted and thoroughly enjoys rubbing people the wrong way through various methods, ranging from simply joking around with her opponent&lt;ref name="LLS Marisa"&gt;[[Lotus Land Story/Story/Marisa's Scenario#Final Stage]]&lt;/ref&gt; to (falsely) claiming credit for causing an incident&lt;ref name="PoFV_vs_Aya&gt;[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View/Story/Yuuka's Scenario#Yuuka vs. Aya (Episode 7)]]&lt;/ref&gt;. Her ''Perfect Memento in Strict Sense'' article states her threat level as "very high" and her human friendship level as the "worst". However, she also tends to visit the [[Human Village]] and comes off as fairly polite, in addition to often appearing at the Hakurei Shrine on peaceful terms (like in her ''Phantasmagoria of Flower View'' ending, for example), meaning this could possibly be an exaggeration.

Yuuka is shown to be rather dormant due to her age - in ''Lotus Land Story'', rather than directly participating in the incident she caused, she simply goes to sleep as if ignoring it. In the Windows series, this is further reinforced - she doesn't move from the Garden of the Sun nearly at all, and thus usually doesn't actively seek opponents. However, there are exceptions to this when something catches her eye, as shown in her excursions in ''Mystic Square'' and ''Phantasmagoria of Flower View''.

In ''[[Kioh Gyoku]]'', ZUN referred to her as ''Youkai [[wikipedia:Moe (slang)|Moe]]'' in her profile. Various official materials follow similar suit with her smiling in a sunflower field in her [[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Yuuka Kazami|''Perfect Memento in Strict Sense''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s article]], and her background appearance in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'' has her sitting with a smile and waving. 

===Abilities===
; Strength
Yuuka is said to be impressively strong. She is stated to be one of the strongest youkai in the victinity of the Hakurei Shrine in ''Mystic Square''.&lt;ref name="MS Manual"&gt;[[Mystic Square/Translation/Manual]]&lt;/ref&gt; Her ''Perfect Memento in Strict Sense'' article says that she sports extremely high power and physical abilities, which she uses to mercilessly eliminate any disturbances. She is also compared to a manifestation of nature, akin to a [[Fairy]], albeit far stronger.&lt;ref name="PMiSSYuuka"&gt;''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'' - [[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Yuuka Kazami|Yuuka Kazami]]&lt;/ref&gt; Out-of-universe, ZUN has also stated her to be a very strong boss.&lt;ref name="SCoOW vol 3&gt;[[Strange Creators of Outer World/Who's Who of Humans &amp; Youkai in Gensokyo/Yuuka Kazami]]&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, while this can hardly be considered a display of strength, she is not always shown to take damage after a battle when encountered as a boss in ''Phantasmagoria of Flower View'' - [[Mystia Lorelei]] and [[Cirno]], rather than actually defeating her after technically "winning" in their own scenarios, escape from her instead. In [[Lyrica Prismriver]]'s scenario, she is still shown unharmed, although Lyrica doesn't seem to escape and has a quite friendly conversation with her after the battle instead. [[Medicine Melancholy|Medicine]] and [[Komachi Onozuka|Komachi]], however, apparently defeat her for good.

However, despite her strength, she appears to move quite slowly in all of her appearances - both as a boss, slowly drifting across the screen in ''Lotus Land Story'', as well as when she's playable - her movement speed is the slowest of all characters. On the other hand, she can move quite fast when using her ability of turning into a ball of light.

;Ability to manipulate flowers
Yuuka is capable of manipulating flowers - making them bloom, shifting the faces of sunflowers towards the sun, or making withered flowers bloom again. As implied in her title, she can use it for flowers of all seasons. This ability is considered to be more of a small addition to her physical abilities, but it can manifest in destructive ways - for example, she destroys the Hakurei Shrine using a giant flower in one of ''Lotus Land Story''&lt;nowiki&gt;'s&lt;/nowiki&gt; endings.&lt;ref name="LLS Ending"&gt;[[Lotus Land Story]] - Bad Ending (ReimuB)&lt;/ref&gt;

;Turning into a ball of light, teleporting
In ''Lotus Land Story'', Yuuka is shown to be capable of turning into a ball of light, allowing her to move at a speed much higher than usual. She also teleports around the screen in most Stage 6 attacks.

;Cloning herself
In the same game, Yuuka is capable of splitting herself into two. The clone doesn't appear to be independent, as it uses the same patterns as Yuuka, firing them simultaneously with her.

===Possessions===
;Parasol
Yuuka always has a parasol with her that's apparently the only flower in [[Gensokyo]] that never withers,&lt;ref&gt;[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View/Story/Yuuka's Scenario#Yuuka vs. Tewi (Episode 3 or 4 or 5)|''Phantasmagoria of Flower View'' - vs. Tewi.]]&lt;/ref&gt; but it's unclear if it can turn into a flower, actually is a flower, or if this is a mere metaphor. According to [[Rinnosuke]], it is a special parasol capable of cutting ultraviolet rays, as well as blocking both rain and danmaku.&lt;ref name="PMiSSYuuka" /&gt; Yuuka uses it to perform graceful attacks.

==Character Design==
[[File:PMiSS_yuka.jpg|thumb|160px|right|Yuuka as illustrated in ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]''.]]
===Name===
Her full name is {{nihongo|''Yuuka Kazami''|風見　幽香}}. The characters for {{nihongo|"Yuuka"|幽香}} mean "dim scent" or "fragrance". {{nihongo|"Kazami"|風見}} literally means "wind watching" and is also the term for a [[Wiktionary:weather vane|weather vane]]. She had no surname in the PC-98 games and ''Kioh Gyoku''.

===Design===
In ''Lotus Land Story'''s official art, Yuuka has green eyes and straight, waist-length hair which covers her right eye. In her first appearance at Stage 5, she wears light pink pajamas and a nightcap. She also carries a large pink pocket-watch with roman numerals. In the final stage, as well as in ''Mystic Square'' and ''Kioh Gyoku'', Yuuka is wearing red plaid pants and a waistcoat of the same color and pattern over a plain white shirt with a yellow ribbon tied around the collar, in addition to carrying her signature parasol. Unusual among Touhou characters, Yuuka is not ornamented with any hair accessories or hats (her nightcap notwithstanding). In appearances after ''Lotus Land Story'', her hair is wavy and cut to shoulder-length.

In ''Mystic Square'', she is shown with a baton when she uses a bomb as a ''Ten Carat Torte'' reference. 

As of ''Phantasmagoria of Flower View'', she wears a red plaid skirt instead of plaid pants and, as in ''Kioh Gyoku'', her eyes are red. Her ''Hopeless Masquerade'' sprite shows her wearing stockings in addition to this outfit.

Yuuka's illustration in ''Kioh Gyoku'' was done by [[ZUN]] himself and was used as the basis for her current design.&lt;ref name="SCoOW vol 3&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike in other appearances, her cut-in boss attack image shows her to have four green and purple wings, and her boss sprite has six wings of light.

Yuuka's alternative outfit in ''Phantasmagoria of Flower View'' is the same as her normal outfit, except her dress is blue.

[[File:Th04YuukaBalls.png|frame|left|Yuuka as a ball of light; left from st5 &amp; right from st6]]
Yuuka was the one behind the events of ''[[Lotus Land Story]]'', where she sent [[youkai]] to destroy the [[Hakurei Shrine]] because she had "spare time". Since she was suddenly challenged to fight, she showed up with a pink negligee and nightcap, accepting the challenge. Given how [[Reimu Hakurei]] started out at noon and [[Marisa Kirisame]] started out at night, it is unknown just at which hour the stage is meant to take place. She used sparkly bullets, as well as a giant laser, potentially being the inspiration for Marisa's ''Master Spark''.

Afterwards, when she was defeated, she ran off, only to be pursued into the sixth stage by the heroine, where she showed up with the appearance similar to her [[Windows]] outfit. Not affected at all by her sudden wake-up and fight, she once again fought with her opponent. After the two long battles, she was finally exterminated.

;''Mystic Square''
:{{Main|Mystic Square/Translation/Yuuka's Scenario|l1=Mystic Square Story}}
Her title was "Oriental Demon" ([[Orange]], the first stage [[boss]] of ''Lotus Land Story'', also has this title). There was an incident caused by [[Makai]], and Yuuka had free time, so therefore she went to Makai to play.

===Games===
;''Phantasmagoria of Flower View''
[[File:Th09YuukaBackSprite.png|frame|left|Yuuka's back sprite in ''PoFV'']]
[[File:Th09YuukaSprite.png|frame|Yuuka's sprite in ''PoFV'']]
:{{Main|Phantasmagoria of Flower View/Story#Yuuka's Story|l1=Phantasmagoria of Flower View Story}}
Yuuka, being a Youkai that's been around for a long time, knew exactly what was happening when this incident started, but took time to realise it was 60 years ago the previous incident occurred. Of course being the youkai of flowers helped too, but unfortunately that also put her straight at the top of everyone's suspect list when they found her enjoying the flowers. She eventually encounters [[Eiki Shiki, Yamaxanadu]] and gets lectured for living too long and teasing others. Eventually, they fight to prove who's the strongest, with Yuuka winning.

;''Hopeless Masquerade''
Yuuka appeared in the fighter ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'' as a background cameo on the [[Hall of Dreams' Great Mausoleum]] stage. She's seen quietly waving and smiling.

===Literature===
[[File:WaHH16Yuuka.jpg|thumb|100px|right|Yuuka in ''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]''.]]
;''Silent Sinner in Blue''
Yuuka was briefly shown in Chapter 9 of ''[[Silent Sinner in Blue]]'', where she attended the party at the [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]] about the Moon Rocket.

;''Oriental Sacred Place''
Yuuka makes a brief cameo on chapter 18 of ''[[Oriental Sacred Place]]'', where [[Sunny Milk]] makes a reference as to how [[Reimu Hakurei]] exterminates [[youkai]], but they don't actually get "exterminated". She appears with many other youkai.

;''Wild and Horned Hermit''
Yuuka was at the flower viewing during Chapter 16 of ''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]''. It appears that she drank from the "[[Ibaraki Box of a Hundred Medicines]]" and thus gained the personality of an [[oni]] for a while. In Chapter 23, she is seen at the shrine with other youkai, while Reimu is doing fortune-telling for them.

;''Forbidden Scrollery''
Yuuka was briefly shown on Chapter 10 ''[[Forbidden Scrollery]]'', attending the Noh play performed by [[Hata no Kokoro]] at the [[Hakurei Shrine]]. She appears to be interacting with Reimu and [[Seiga Kaku]].

===Seihou Games===

}}
Yuuka appeared in ''[[Seihou Project]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s second work ''[[Kioh Gyoku]]'', a [[danmaku]] game by the junior doujin circle "[[Shunsatsu sare do?]]", to which [[ZUN]] contributed music and art. Her title was "Beauty of the Twilight" and her theme was "Lovely Mound of Cherry Blossoms ~ Flower of Japan". To add to this, [[Reimu Hakurei]] and [[Marisa Kirisame]] made guest appearances in the previous work, ''[[Shuusou Gyoku]]''.

Like the other playable characters, Yuuka has no story mode. She was one of the few who fought without a spaceship, along with [[VIVIT]] and [[Muse]] (although [[Erich]] wasn't using a spaceship, but a high-performance [[wikipedia:Mecha|mecha]]). As she came from another world, no one recognized her. She was merely referred to as "foreign" by [[Milia]], who also boasted about her speed. VIVIT remarks that she feels familiar, referring to her encounter with Reimu and Marisa in ''Shuusou Gyoku''. [[Gates]] said that Yuuka's fighting style was completely different and that he wanted her data, and [[Marie]] thought the battle between her and Yuuka was "[[wiktionary:eccentric|eccentric]]". The last [[boss]], [[Muse (Seihou Character)|Muse]], felt a "different divinity" in Yuuka.

==Relationships==
===Reimu and Marisa===
It appears that Yuuka has known [[Reimu Hakurei]] and [[Marisa Kirisame]] before the events of ''[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]'' through meeting them during ''[[Lotus Land Story]]''. She describes Marisa as "grown up quite a bit" and tells Reimu that she's "still being a poor shrine maiden".

Yuuka was the one who sent [[youkai]] to destroy the [[Hakurei Shrine]] during ''Lotus Land Story''. Marisa sees her as a "strange fellow".

===Minor Relationships===
;[[Elly]]
In [[PC-98]], Yuuka seems to have some kind of relationship with [[Elly]], since she's the [[gatekeeper]] of [[Mugenkan]].

==Additional Information==
*Yuuka is thought to be the original user of the [[spell card]] "Master Spark", which [[Marisa Kirisame]] subsequently copied. Yuuka is also known for what is commonly referred to as the "Dual Spark", two slightly smaller beams fired simultaneously when she makes a clone of herself during ''Lotus Land Story''.
*In ''[[Mystic Square]]'', Yuuka's player sprite is the only one outlined in blue. In ''Phantasmagoria of Flower View'', the outline is gone.
*Yuuka, along with the [[Prismriver Sisters]] and [[Mystia Lorelei]], is the only spell card-using character from the first generation of [[Windows]] games not to appear in ''[[Shoot the Bullet]]''.
*Yuuka is also the only pre-''[[Undefined Fantastic Object]]'' character to not have an article in ''[[The Grimoire of Marisa]]''.
*Her attacks in ''Phantasmagoria of Flower View'' comparatively resemble attacks from ''Kioh Gyoku'', where her shot and bomb was similar, her attack range was wide, and the shape and form of her danmaku had the theme of flowers.
*Her bad ending in ''Mystic Square'' has her [[Canon#Fourth wall|breaking the fourth wall]] and kindly telling the player to rest, then try clearing the game again.
*If the ''Seihou Project'' canon were ever linked with the ''[[Touhou Project]]'' canon, Yuuka would be the only known Touhou character to have actually destroyed multiple, physical spaceships and aircrafts. UFOs appear in ''Undefined Fantastic Object'' where Reimu, Marisa and [[Sanae Kochiya]] appear to take them down, although these were fake because they were actually [[Seed of Unknown Form|Seeds of Unknown Form]].

　　妖怪出ないかなぁ。うちの部屋とか、仕事場とかに。&lt;br/&gt;
　　巫女さんでも可。&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
　　ちなみに幽香は、怪綺談エキストラＥＤのあと、予定通り&lt;br/&gt;
　　究極の魔法と言う物を拾得しました。それが何なのかは&lt;br/&gt;

   '''3. Youkai Moe'''&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Now then, with absolutely no relation (well, some relation) the only character with a slightly different feel, Yuuka, is actually the last boss I made a long time ago for the STG Touhou Lotus Land Story, and is a playable character of Touhou Mystic Square. &lt;br&gt;
A youkai. Yes. Youkai moe~.&lt;br&gt;
The reason she doesn't feel oriental at all is because she's a Youkai. Yes. Youkai moe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

By the way, I think that 10 out of 10 people would read the level 1 barrage 萌風 as "moekaze"&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Wonder if a Youkai would come out. Like in my room, or my workplace.&lt;br&gt;
A shrine maiden is fine too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Also, after Mystic Square's extra ending, as planned, Yuuka received the ultimate magic. The author himself doesn't know exactly what it is.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

It's definitely something moe. Moe~.

A youkai that lives in Gensokyo. She has the ability to manipulate flowers.&lt;br&gt;
She loves seasonal flowers, so throughout the year she moves to the respective places where the flowers grow: spring flowers for spring, summer flowers for summer, autumn flowers for autumn, and although there aren't many, winter flowers for winter.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
This time, as she witnessed Gensokyo being overtaken by flowers, she wasn't surprised at all and very well understood the situation. Although she understood it, she thought that it'd be paradise if it was always this way.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The outbreak must eventually be resolved. She decided that she would enjoy this outbreak while she can. It'd be a waste to not enjoy this once-every-sixty-years outbreak.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Without a destination in mind, she enjoyed the flowers as she slept and awoke, as her pattern continued.

{{nihongo|'''Yuuma Toutetsu'''|饕餮 尤魔|''Toutetsu Yuuma''}} is the leader of the Gouyoku Alliance under which the eagle spirits serve. She is briefly mentioned by [[Saki Kurokoma]] in the Extra stage of ''[[Wily Beast and Weakest Creature]]'' before making a proper appearance as the main antagonist and final boss of ''[[Touhou Gouyoku Ibun]]''.

==General Information== 
===Personality===
She is clever, calculating, and avoids pointless conflict by nature. However, it seems she doesn't think twice before attacking someone if she thinks her business is in danger, as she attacks multiple heroines in ''[[Touhou Gouyoku Ibun]]'' thinking they were there to steal her oil. She exhausts all the other organizations within the [[Animal Realm]] because they feel her methods to be dishonest and cowardly, but her underlings adore that sort of thing from their "way-too-reliable boss with nearly-invincible power." And as per her ability, the things she eats can influence her personality, so it may vary from time to time. &lt;ref name="GIP"&gt; ''[[Touhou Gouyoku Ibun]]'' - Yuuma's Profile &lt;/ref&gt;

===Abilities===
;Capable of absorbing anything
She's able to swallow whole and devour absolutely anything, whether its body is physical, spiritual, organic or inorganic. On top of that, by swallowing something, she's able to comprehend it and turn it into her own power. The things she eats are also said to influence her personality. &lt;ref name="GIP"/&gt;

==Character Design==
===Origin===
Yuuma is a taotie, a creature in Chinese mythology known for their extreme gluttony. Taotie are also referred to as one of the "Four Evil Creatures of the World" in Chinese mythology, and the taotie in particular may serve as a reference to the mythological figure Chi You, one of the three legendary founding fathers of China. In China today, Chi You is worshipped as the god of war.

===Name===
Her full name is {{nihongo|Yuuma Toutetsu|饕餮 尤魔}}.

Her given name, {{nihongo|Yuuma|尤魔}}, is written with characters meaning "outstanding" and "devil". The character {{nihongo||尤|yuu}} is likely derived from {{nihongo|[[wikipedia:Chiyou|Chiyou]]|蚩尤|Shiyuu}}, an ancient Chinese tribal leader theorized to be the basis of Taotie symbolism.

Her surname, {{nihongo|Toutetsu|饕餮}}, is the Japanese name of a Chinese creature called the [[wikipedia:Taotie|Taotie]]. This follows the pattern established by [[Yachie Kicchou]] and [[Saki Kurokoma]], who are also named after the creatures they are based on.

===Design===
Yuuma has white hair and red sheep horns with blue ribbons tied around them. She has red eyes with horizontal pupils and pointy ears decorated with silver earrings. Her teeth appear to be notably sharp.

She wears a teal dress with red half-attached arm sleeves. The skirt is decorated with a meander pattern, alongside a couple of eye patterns. She carries around a comically large spork.

;''[[Touhou Gouyoku Ibun]]''
The final boss of the game. Most of the other characters were unable to beat her, either due to Yuuma absorbing their attacks or being talked out of actually dealing with her, but Okina manipulated [[Flandre Scarlet]] into fighting her and she used her ability to destroy anything to beat her, as Flandre's ability couldn't be absorbed nor could Yuuma talk her out of fighting her due to Flandre's childish nature. As a result, Flandre is the only character who can progress to Yuuma's final phase.

==Relationships==
;[[Yachie Kicchou]]
Given they are leaders of opposing factions in the Animal Realm, they are antagonistic of each other. However, considering that both of their factions teamed up during the events of Wily Beast and Weakest Creature, their relationship might not be as terrible as it seemed. 

;[[Saki Kurokoma]]
Similarly to Yachie, Yuuma and Saki are the leaders of opposing factions in the Animal Realm, so they are enemies.

| translation = '''Undefeated Matriarch of the Gouyoku Alliance'''&lt;br /&gt;Yuuma Toutetsu

Species: Taotie&lt;br&gt;
Ability: Capable of absorbing anything&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

A divine beast with the form of a lamb.&lt;br&gt;
Both greedy and a massive eater, she's able to swallow whole and devour absolutely anything, whether its body is physical, spiritual, organic or inorganic. On top of that, by swallowing something, she's able to comprehend it and turn it into her own power.&lt;br&gt;
The things she eats are also said to influence her personality.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

She's the chairwoman of the Gouyoku Alliance, an organization in the [[Animal Realm]].&lt;br&gt;
Rather than banding together to do anything eye-catching, the Gouyoku Alliance sits back to take a broad view of events, and plots to steal everything without lifting a finger when the time is ripe. Their motto is "when a snipe and clam argue, the fisherman catches both."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The other organizations are exhausted by her, saying that she loves dishonest and cowardly methods, but her underlings adore her as "a way-too-reliable boss with nearly-invincible power." She herself isn't particularly attached to the idea of having underlings, and seems to prefer doing everything on her own. Perhaps inspired by their boss's attitude, many members of the Gouyoku Alliance tend to act separately and of their own accord.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Despite appearances, she's actually clever, calculating, and avoids pointless conflict by nature. Upon determining that an enemy isn't one to bow in the face of threats, the Alliance studies whether they can be recruited. If they determine that recruitment will also go over poorly, they attempt to forge a mutually beneficial relationship, if only in appearances. If even that seems to be difficult, they choose to retreat quickly.&lt;br&gt;From the perspective of the Animal Realm-- a survival-of-the-fittest world where might makes absolute right-- they're a particularly abnormal organization.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

For the Gouyoku Alliance, choosing all-out war is truly the absolute last resort.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;


This time around, she took advantage of [[Wily Beast and Weakest Creature|the commotion involving the beast spirits]] to set her sights on the Former Hell of Blood Pools, where she planned to obtain every drop of desire from both the Animal Realm and the surface world.&lt;br&gt;However, her plan was leaked to the humans up above by the [[Okina Matara|hidden god]] living on the surface, and she was obliterated by an [[Flandre Scarlet|assassin]] trained in anti-Taotie combat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

After regenerating, she gave up on monopolizing the petroleum deposit, and forged a mutually-beneficial relationship with the hidden god.

{{nihongo|'''Yuyuko Saigyouji'''|西行寺　幽々子|Saigyouji Yuyuko}} is the main antagonist of [[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]. She's the [[ghost]] "princess" head of [[Hakugyokurou]] in the [[Netherworld]].

==General Information==

She first appeared as the Final Boss of ''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]'', later becoming a playable character along with [[Youmu Konpaku]] (as a duo) in ''[[Imperishable Night]]'' and showing up as an expansion character in ''[[Immaterial and Missing Power]]'', ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]'', and ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]''. She would eventually also appear as the Stage 1 boss in ''[[Ten Desires]]'', and as a Day 4 boss in ''[[Impossible Spell Card]]''.

Unlike many departed spirits, Yuyuko resembles a living [[human]]; a [[humanoid]]. 

===Personality===
She is very cheerful and friendly. In fact, her playful, good-humored personality, otherworldly beauty, and courtesan charm can have a disarming effect. She often makes bizarre and apparently nonsensical remarks and sometimes seems to overlook the obvious, leading to her characterization as an airhead or a ditz. For instance, in ''[[Touhou Bougetsushou]]'', she toyed with [[Youmu Konpaku]] as a daily occurrence even with [[Ran Yakumo]] present.

However, at other times she will reveal an extremely cunning and perceptive side and will also sometimes display an extraordinary level of knowledge. For instance, in ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]'', she was the quickest character to identify the culprit as [[Tenshi Hinanawi]] when the incident was in the omen stage ([[Yukari Yakumo]] spoke of the dwindling of phantoms as [[Komachi Onozuka]]'s negligence, but Yuyuko guessed correctly). Additionally, in ''[[Ten Desires]]'', she obliquely informed the playable character about the location of the incident regarding the [[divine spirit]]s. She is also known for her incredible appetite.

===Abilities===
;Manipulating death
This is the ability to, without exception and without permitting any resistance, end the life of any living being, whether it be [[human]] or [[youkai]]. The only kind of creatures immune from this are [[Immortal|Hourai Immortals]]. Be aware that this does not mean that she can make any person die instantly, but rather that she can make it so that any person will die with absolutely certainty, regardless of if they wish to die or not. Clearly and simply, it is an unusually and dreadfully powerful ability. Although the fear and responsibility brought with this ability is what drove her to commit suicide and become a [[ghost]], it seems that she hasn't forgotten this ability since then, and it seems that she can use this ability in a carefree manner (though she doesn't act carelessly in the usage of this ability). However, whether she's able to end life only to the extent of fainting, or if she invites one to death gently, is unclear. During her lifetime, the latter was true. Her Last Word "''Saigyouji Parinirvana''" is said to be the very incarnation of this ability.

;Manipulating departed souls
This is the ability that enables her to manipulate ghosts and spirits, an ability she possessed even while she was alive. Although it's unclear what one is exactly able to accomplish with this ability, it seems to place Yuyuko on the role of the manager of the ghosts who stay for a while in the [[Netherworld]]. Because of this ability, she is able to let those from [[Hell]] stay eternally in the Netherworld.

==Character Design==
===Name===
Her full name is {{nihongo|''Yuyuko Saigyouji''|西行寺　幽々子}}. Her surname {{nihongo||西行寺|Saigyouji|lit. "West journey temple"}} comes from her motif as a daughter of the famous Japanese poet {{nihongo||西行 法師|[[wikipedia:Saigyō Hōshi|Saigyō Hōshi]]}}, who lived in the late [[wikipedia:Heian period|Heian period]] and the early [[wikipedia:Kamakura period|Kamakura period]]. He passed away in the {{nihongo|Hirokawa Temple|弘川寺|Hirokawadera}}, which could be where the character {{nihongo||寺|ji}} came from.

Her first name {{nihongo||幽々子|Yuyuko}} actually doesn't have much meaning but can be literally translated to "ghostly child" or "ghost ghost child". The ''-ko'' is a common suffix in Japanese that's used in female names which literally means "child". The iteration mark "{{lang|ja|[[wiktionary:々|々]]}}", casually called a {{nihongo||ノマ|noma}}, is used to indicate that the previous kanji should be repeated, thus her name's equivalent to "{{lang|ja|幽幽子}}". It's seen in the Japanese main title of {{nihongo|''Perfect Cherry Blossom''|東方妖'''々'''夢}}.

===Design===
[[File:PMiSS yuyuko.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Yuyuko's depiction in ''[[PMiSS]]''.]]
In ''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]'' she has maroon eyes, short wavy pink hair, and is surrounded by several small formless [[Phantom]]s. In all of the games, she wears a light blue and white kimono with dark blue trim and white designs; a blue mob cap on the front of which is a [[wikipedia:Hitaikakushi|hitaikakushi]] with a red ghost insignia; and a veil of the same color of the kimono behind her head. She wears dark shoes with blue ribbons attached. In ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]'', her hair's slightly longer than normal, and her veil's more white than blue.

In ''[[Ten Desires]]'', her hair's a paler shade of pink, her kimono's still a light pale blue, and the ribbon around her waist, the ribbon going down her kimono, and the bands and lacing on her arms and collar are black instead of white and blue. She now wears a transparent layer underneath, her mob cap lacks the veil it had in ''Perfect Cherry Blossom'', ''[[Immaterial and Missing Power]]'', and ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]''; and her hitaikakushi's insignia has changed shape. Her black shoes also lack the blue ribbons.

Throughout the games, the designs on her kimono change. In ''Perfect Cherry Blossom'', it has floral designs; in ''Immaterial and Missing Power'', the designs are of butterflies and flowers; in ''[[Imperishable Night]]'', the butterflies and flowers design is replaced with a clouds and moon design; and in ''Ten Desires'', the designs are of ghosts.

The phantoms surrounding her sometimes carry an object. In ''Perfect Cherry Blossom'', one of the phantoms carries a cherry blossom twig; in ''Imperishable Night'', one carries a small blue lantern; and in ''Scarlet Weather Rhapsody'' onwards, they no longer carry anything.

In [[ZUN's E-mails]], ZUN described her as having a slightly tall height.

==Appearances==
===Games===
;''Perfect Cherry Blossom''
[[File:Th07YuyukoSprite.png|frame|Yuyuko's sprite in ''PCB'' &amp; ''StB'']]
Yuyuko is the final [[boss]] of ''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]''. During its events, she made [[Youmu Konpaku]] find a way to make the [[Saigyou Ayakashi]] bloom to resurrect the corpse buried beneath it, apparently unaware that it was her own body. Forced to abandon her plan due to obstruction by Reimu and the gang, she resigned herself to continuing her existence as a ghost.

[[File:Th13YuyukoSprite.png|frame|Yuyuko's sprite in ''TD'' &amp; ''ISC'']]
Yuyuko made her appearance as the [[stage]] 1 [[boss]] of ''[[Ten Desires]]''. Her in-game sprite was re-used from ''Perfect Cherry Blossom'' with minor adjustments. The heroines come to the [[Netherworld]] believing that Yuyuko's the cause of the mass or [[divine spirit]]s. Yuyuko insists that they duel if the heroine wants to know about the incident. After she's defeated, Yuyuko doesn't appear injured and explains what the spirits are. She also redirects the heroine to the [[Myouren Temple]], the location where all the divine spirits are heading. With [[Youmu Konpaku]]'s scenario however, she wishes to investigate, but isn't allowed out of the Netherworld unless she defeats Yuyuko.

If connecting ''SWR'' with ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]'', then Yuyuko can become a selectable character to play with, although she appears in no scenarios.

;''Hopeless Masquerade''
[[File:Th135Youmu&amp;Yuyuko.gif|frame|Anigif of Yuyuko w/ Youmu in ''HM'']]
Yuyuko appears as a background cameo in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'' on the [[Divine Spirit Mausoleum]] [[stage]]. She is seen with [[Youmu Konpaku]] as she endlessly feeds her rice balls.

;''Impossible Spell Card''
Presumably from hearing or seeing a wanted sign about the mischief-making [[amanojaku]] [[Seija Kijin]], Yuyuko appears to be one of the many [[youkai]] that tries to capture her. She uses [[spell card]]s that are considered impossible to dodge. She is shown to be located at the [[Myouren Temple Cemetery]].

===Literature===
;''[[Silent Sinner in Blue]]''
[[Ran Yakumo]] goes to the [[Netherworld]] to ask both Youmu and Yuyuko if they could keep an eye on Remilia and her rocket. Although she first refused to do so, Yuyuko tells Youmu that she was indeed vigilant about the vampire's actions and tasks her with telling [[Reimu Hakurei|the shrine maiden]] to use the power of gods as "fuel".

Afterwards, in chapter 16, Yuyuko and Youmu arrive at the spot Yukari indicated. There, Yuyuko explains to [[Youmu]] that what they see is the result of dissolving the boundary between the imaginary Moon and the real one, and they go through it. They find Yukari's umbrella there, which Yuyuko interprets as a hint to where they have to go.

Finally, Yukari opens another gap which takes them to the [[Lunar Capital]]. There, they sneak in, searching for some treasure until the next Lunar month, when Yukari could open another connection between the Moon and the Earth. They come back with a millennial sake, ending a successful 2nd Lunar War.
;''[[Foul Detective Satori]]''
Yuyuko was put into a coma by [[Mizuchi Miyadeguchi]] who was possessing [[Marisa Kirisame]] and brought her sake. After waking up, Youmu, [[Rin Kaenbyou]] and [[Satori Komeji]] head out in order to find Marisa, discovering her at [[Alice Margatroid]]'s house, who was also now in a coma. They subsequently tie her up for being a suspect and interrogate her.

==Relationships==
;[[Youmu Konpaku]]
Youmu is Yuyuko's gardener, bodyguard and fencing instructor.&lt;ref&gt;[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]] - Youmu Konpaku&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Imperishable Night]] - Youmu's Profile and Manual&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]] Youmu's Profile and Manual&lt;/ref&gt;  Youmu is unquestioningly loyal to her master, though she has a hard time understanding Yuyuko's riddles.

;[[Youki Konpaku]]
Youki is Youmu's predecessor, who taught Youmu all that she knows. He also knew the full story of Yuyuko's connection to the [[Saigyou Ayakashi]] even after Yuyuko herself had forgotten. Yuyuko found him harder to rely on than Youmu.

;[[Yukari Yakumo]]
Yuyuko has been friends with Yukari since before her death, and is one of the few people who can see through her plans.

;[[Eiki Shiki]]
According to [[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]], Yuyuko was appointed her position by the yama, therefore it can be assumed that Eiki outranks her (Yuyuko also refers to Eiki as "Eiki-Sama" in [[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]).  Yuyuko knows Eiki personally, as Eiki dropped by to push her to teach [[Youmu]] more in Youmu's ending in [[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]].

===Minor Relationships===
;[[Saigyou Ayakashi]] ([[Youkai]] Tree in her Garden)
Her corpse was buried by an unknown person under the Saigyou Ayakashi after she committed suicide.

;[[Prismriver Sisters|Lunasa]], [[Prismriver Sisters|Lyrica]], and [[Prismriver Sisters|Merlin Prismriver]] (Regular performers)

*Excluding spin-off games, Yuyuko is the first, and currently only, character in the ''[[Touhou Project]]'' to first appear as a final boss, then later in [[Ten Desires|another game]] as a Stage 1 boss.
*[[ZUN]] originally wanted to arrange her theme from ''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]'' and implement it into ''Ten Desires'', but he ended up choosing against it because Yuyuko is only a Stage 1 boss in the newer game; hence why she ended up with a unique theme.
*She has the highest number of [[spell card]]s as a Stage 1 boss; even more so than the Stage 2, Stage 3 and Stage 4 bosses in ''[[Ten Desires]]''.
*Her sixth palette in ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]'' seems to resemble [[Hong Meiling]], and there's another palette that resembles [[Ran Yakumo]].
*Assuming that Yuyuko ''is'' the daughter of [[Wikipedia:Saigyō Hōshi|Saigyō Hōshi]], she and [[Fujiwara no Mokou]] are actually distant relatives, since Saigyō is a descendant of Mokou's supposed father [[wikipedia:Fujiwara no Fuhito|Fujiwara no Fuhito]].
*Yuyuko's one of the few final bosses in the ''[[Touhou Project]]'' who, upon defeat, revives for a final spell card. Others are [[Eirin Yagokoro]], [[Kaguya Houraisan]], [[Tenshi Hinanawi]], and [[Sumireko Usami]].
* The image file that contains all of the boss names (romanized) to display on the top-left during their battle in one of ''Perfect Cherry Blossom'''s demos has Yuyuko named ''Ayaka Saigyouji'' instead. The latest demo (ver0.11) has her named ''Yuyuka Saigyouji''

&lt;p style="border: none; padding: 0; margin: 0"&gt;　○幽冥楼閣の亡霊少女&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="width: 34em; margin: 0 2em; border: none; padding: 0;"&gt;西行寺　幽々子（さいぎょうじ・ゆゆこ）&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

ラスボス、伝統ある西行寺家のお嬢様、今は亡霊の姫である。&lt;br&gt;
主に死を操る程度の能力を持つ。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

その昔、幻想郷には一人の歌聖が居た。歌聖は自然を愛し死ぬまで旅してまわったという。自分の死期を悟ると、己の願い通り最も見事な桜の木の下で永遠の眠りについた。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

それ以来その桜はますます見事に咲き誇り、多くの人を魅了し、多くの人が永遠の眠りについた。そうした死の魅力を持つ桜は、いつしか妖力を持つようになっていたのだ。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;


それから千年余り経った。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

西行寺家にはいわく付きの妖怪桜「西行妖（さいぎょうあやかし）」がある。この桜は、幽々子がここに来てから、どんな春になっても、開花する事は無かったのだ。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

ある日、幽々子はいつもの様に書見を楽しんでいると、書架から古い記録を発見した。それには、何時の物とも分らぬ記述で、&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;span style="white-space: nowrap;"&gt;「富士見の娘、西行妖満開の時、幽明境を分かつ（死んだという事）、&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
　その魂、白玉楼中で安らむ様、西行妖の花を封印しこれを持って結&lt;br&gt;
　界とする。願うなら、二度と苦しみを味わうことの無い様、永久に&lt;br&gt;
　転生することを忘れ･･･」&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

と書かれていた。&lt;br&gt;
幽々子は、西行妖の封印を解き、花を満開にすることが出来れば何者かが復活すると考え、興味本位で春度を集めることにした。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

本来、冥界に存在するものは殆ど霊体である。その為彼女は、冥界の西行妖の下に眠るとされる亡骸に疑問と興味を持ち、それでその封印&lt;span style="white-space: nowrap;"&gt;を解こうと考えた。彼女は普段、人や妖怪を死に誘う事しか出来ない。&lt;/span&gt;その彼女が初めて死者を復活させようとしているのである。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;


庭師の妖夢の懸命の努力により西行妖以外の桜は満開になっていて、西行妖も花が開きかけていた。あと一押しというところで、元々狭い幻想郷の春はほぼ尽きてしまう。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

そこに、僅かの春を持った人間が訪れるとは誰も予想してなかった。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

そして、残りの春を手に入れるために闘うこととなる。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;



しかし幽々子は、普段の生活に安らみ過ぎた為か、はたまた、記録が余りに古い文献だった為か、文中にあった亡くなった娘というのが、自分の事だということに、最後まで気付かなかったのである。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

元々、幽々子は死霊を操る程度の人間だった。それがいつしか、死に誘う程度の能力を持つ様になり、簡単に人を死に追いやる事が出来るようになっていった。彼女はその自分の能力を疎い自尽した。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

亡霊になってからは、生前の事等すっかり忘れ、それはもう死に誘う事を楽しむようになっていたのだから世話も無い。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

幽々子が転生も消滅もせずに楼中に留まっているのも、西行妖の封印があるためである。この結界が解けたとたん、止まっていた時間は止め処なく流れることになり、それは、再び幽々子の死に繋がる。自分を復活させることも白玉楼にいる自分の消滅にも繋がる為、復活は寸前で失敗するのは当然である。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

やはり幽々子は死を操ることしか出来ないのだ。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

唯一そのことを知る先代魂魄妖忌は、半分人間という性質上ゆっくり年を取り、妖夢に幽々子の事を伝えたつもりで消えた。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

何時までも幽々子は、冥界のお姫様として、&lt;br&gt;
死に絶えた西行寺家のお嬢様として暮すのである。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

　　幽々子が西行妖の開花を見ることは、決して無い。
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

'''Ghost Girl in the Netherworld Tower'''&lt;br/&gt;
'''Yuyuko Saigyouji'''

Final boss, formerly the mistress of old Saigyouji clan, currently the [[ghost]] princess.&lt;br/&gt;
Mainly she possesses the ability to manipulate death.

Long ago, there was a divinely talented poet in [[Gensokyo]]. He loved nature and spent most of his time traveling. When he became aware that the hour of his death drew near, he chose to begin his eternal rest under the most beautiful cherry tree he could find..

That cherry tree has grown even more beautiful since then, charming many people into resting in peace beneath its blossoms. The tree with the mortuary charm developed the powers of a [[youkai]] after a while.
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
A thousand years have passed.

In the garden of the Saigyouji clan, there exists a [[youkai]] cherry blossom with a story behind it; it is called the [[Saigyou Ayakashi]]. For as long as Yuyuko had been there, this cherry tree has never bloomed, even in spring.

One day, while browsing through the library as usual, Yuyuko found an old record. It looked so old that it was practically ageless; within it, the following was written...

:"On the day the Saigyou Ayakashi had reached full bloom, the daughter of Fujimi crossed the boundary of life and death (in other words, passed away). So that her soul may rest in peace within Hakugyokurou, I shall seal the tree's blossoms and hereby fashion these limbs into a barrier. It is my hope that she will never again reincarnate, and thus never again have to suffer pain..." 

Yuyuko had read that breaking the seal on the Saigyou Ayakashi, making it bloom fully, would cause ''a certain someone'' to be resurrected; she started gathering spring's essence out of curiosity.

Basically, those present in the [[Netherworld]] are mostly spirit beings. It is for that reason that she wondered about the corpse lying under the Saigyou Ayakashi with great interest, going as far as to consider breaking the seal. Her ability only enables her invite people to their death. Bringing life to something already dead would be a first.
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Thanks to an all-out effort put forth by [[Youmu Konpaku|Youmu]], the gardener, every cherry blossom bloomed perfectly; every cherry blossom except for the Saigyou Ayakashi, which still bordered on blooming. By that point, [[Gensokyo]]'s spring had almost been completely drained.

No one would have imagined that a living [[human]], bearing a tiny drop of spring, would visit.

A battle for that last remaining bit of spring ensued...
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Perhaps it was because of her carefree afterlife, or maybe the record had aged beyond recognition, but Yuyuko ultimately failed to realize that the girl who was written about in the record... was herself.

In the beginning, Yuyuko only possessed the ability to manipulate departed souls. Unconsciously, that power grew stronger, that eventually she possessed the ability to invite others to death. Terrified by her own ability, she committed suicide.

After becoming a [[ghost]], she thoroughly forgot everything about the time she was alive, and started to enjoy being able to invoke death.

The reason Yuyuko can neither reincarnate nor vanish is because of the seal on the Saigyou Ayakashi. Once the boundary is breached, the time that was frozen will continue to flow, resulting in her death again. Reviving the corpse will destroy Yuyuko's ghost, so it's no wonder that the near-success of the revival ended in inevitable failure.

After all, Yuyuko is not able to manipulate anything but death.

The only person who knew the whole story, [[Youki Konpaku]], grew slowly older due to the nature of half-[[human]]s, and disappeared with the belief that Youmu could inherit the truth about Yuyuko.

For all time, Yuyuko will remain as the princess of [[Netherworld]] and mistress of long-dead Saigyouji clan.

:She shall never bear witness to the blooming of the [[Saigyou Ayakashi]].

Ability: Manipulating death&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
A cheerful ghost maiden who won't go to Heaven and lives in the Netherworld. She can't remember when she died, because she's been dead for a long time. The reason why she can't rest in peace is that she must have left her regret in the human world.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
She's so carefree that she often acts tricky. Because of this, the straightforward Youmu is always troubled by this princess. But to tell the truth, she loves this nation outside of [[Gensokyo]] from the bottom of her heart.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
She's not good at physical attacks before and after death. Like other ghosts, she's always floating. She moves smoothly like a curve. You'll find yourself being defeated all of a sudden since her attack is too mysterious.&lt;br&gt;

'''Dreaming Ghost, Yuyuko Saigyouji'''&lt;br/&gt;
She exists in the [[Netherworld]] as a [[ghost]] maiden.&lt;br/&gt;
She can manipulate death, and she has been existing as a ghost since ancient times.&lt;br/&gt;
It is said that experiencing death in [[Gensokyo]] is strangely cheerful in many cases.&lt;br/&gt;
And she is also a cheerful ghost, too.&lt;br/&gt;
Moreover, she is an airhead. Nobody knows whether she is usually like this or she just pretends to be.&lt;br/&gt;
When she passed away, she may have forgotten one important thing.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Her favorite weapon is the Phantom Butterflies. She uses it as an indiscriminate attack, because she doesn't consider the situation at hand at all.

:''Notes''
:She teams up with [[Youmu Konpaku]] in this title.
:Normal speed only applies when she is used as a solo character.
:Her missile's wide shot is easy to use, it can attack in almost all angles, if an enemy doesn't appear from behind.
:However, it's inferior in destructive power. If you want something stronger, let's consider changing to Youmu.
:Recommended for players who don't consider at all.

'''Dreaming Ghost'''&lt;br /&gt;
'''Yuyuko Saigyouji'''

Species: [[Ghost]]&lt;br /&gt;
Ability: Manipulating death

Yuyuko is a ghost princess who lives in the [[Netherworld]].
Like typical ghosts, she is quite the opposite of what [[human]]s call "down-to-earth", and her whims distract [[Youmu Konpaku|Youmu]] all the time.
Unlike typical ghosts, her form has legs and feet.

She is a ghost&amp;mdash;the form of humans after death.
There is no doubt that Yuyuko "lives" a whimsical life, but she doesn't unleash her ability lightly, so neither humans nor [[youkai]] have a reason to attack her.
Still, many beings across the land fear her within their hearts.

Ability: Manipulating death

Yuyuko is a ghost princess who lives in the [[Netherworld]], and is Youmu's mistress. She doesn't have too much of an interest in divine spirits, but the direction in which the divine spirits are headed intrigued her a little. This direction was [[Myouren Temple]], a temple that was just recently constructed. It was a place for those who want to meditate to suppress their inner desires, but for divine spirits, which are the essence of desires, to congregate there... It surely didn't seem like the conduct of a typical temple.

And it happened when she was thinking about that.

Some humans were intruding her properties to investigate about divine spirits. After seeing them, she was relaxed that there was no need for her to do anything, and decided to continue with her flower viewing.

A {{nihongo|'''Zombie Fairy'''|ゾンビフェアリー|Zonbifearī}} are a sub-group of [[Fairy|fairies]] that are [[stage enemies]] in ''[[Subterranean Animism]]'' and ''[[Double Spoiler]]'', supporting [[Rin Kaenbyou]] during her [[boss]] battles. They're neither dead nor undead, as both [[Marisa Kirisame]] and [[Aya Shameimaru]] know that these fairies are not real zombies and are pretending.

==Background Information==
===Name===
They are originally unnamed, but a popular fan name for them is {{nihongo|''Zombie Fairy''|ゾンビフェアリー}}. This is derived from [[Rin Kaenbyou]]'s [[spell card]] ''Cursed Sprite "Zombie Fairy"''.

===Design===
The zombie fairy simply has a livid appearance on both their dress and hair. If they're "killed", they are shown to have a halo.

==Zombie Fairy's Appearances==
[[File:Th11Zombie Fairy.png|frame|Sprite of a Zombie Fairy]]
;''Subterranean Animism''
The zombie fairies' first début was in ''[[Subterranean Animism]]''. As Rin first released a few [[fairy|fairies]] before the [[spell card]] ''Cursed Sprite "Zombie Fairy"'', they'll play dead if the player defeats them. Once the spell card occurs, they'll turn into zombie fairies and start moving towards the player. They can be defeated and unharmed, but will immediately start chasing the player again as soon as they've been resurrected. On hard and lunatic modes, they appear in the spell card ''Cursed Sprite "Vengeful Spirit: Possessed Fairy" '', and thus there are more zombie fairies and are thus harder to deal with. They also appear on her last spell card ''"Rekindling of Dead Ashes"'', doing the same actions.

;''Double Spoiler''
[[File:Th125SC055.jpg|thumb|200px|A crowd of Zombies Fairies, as seen in ''[[Double Spoiler]]'']]
Zombie fairies make a return in ''[[Double Spoiler]]'', where they appear in the spell card ''Death Sign "Ghost Town"'' and ''"Corpse Shopping District"''. Each time [[Aya Shameimaru]] takes a photo of a zombie fairy, they'll play dead and move to another part of the screen, waiting to be resurrected. On the former spell card, they'll shoot [[danmaku]] directly at Aya while moving towards her at a speed. On the latter spell card, they'll move randomly around the screen, not shooting danmaku. The more times Aya takes successful photos, the more zombie fairies will appear on the screen, filling it up. They've got some sort of [[vengeful spirit]] when they're first placed on the screen, and the sprite of the zombie fairy looks like it's been modifies from ''Subterranean Animism''.

==Additional Information==
*According to Marisa in her [[The Grimoire of Marisa/Orin's Spell Cards|book]], the [[Subterranean Animism/Spell Cards/Stage 5#Spell Card 123|Cursed Sprite "Zombie Fairy"]] spell card cannot begin without fairies to play along in the first place.
*[[Nue Houjuu]] uses a [[fairy]] in the appearance of a [[ghost]] on [[stage]] 4  of ''[[Undefined Fantastic Object]]''. It's unknown if its related to the zombie fairies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2268">The majority of the characters that appear in the [[Touhou Project]] are created by [[ZUN]]. However occasionally important figures not part of Touhou are mentioned throughout the series. These characters often play their role in the series as support to a plot or story and are usually only mentioned by characters who are part of the series. Although their appearances were brief, many [[god]]s from the Shinto religion appeared in [[Silent Sinner in Blue]] overwhelming some of the Touhou Project's strongest characters.

Figures mentioned by ZUN do not count unless they are mentioned as part of the story; characters who are based on a historic/fictional figure also do not count.

==Non-Touhou Characters==
{{stub|section}}
Here is a list of all Non-Touhou related character/figures who appeared/mentioned throughout the series.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="289">Characters without an official name. Update these if ZUN ever retroactively adopts a fanname for them or names them himself.
