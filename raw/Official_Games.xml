{{thtitle||Barettofiria-tachi no Yamishijou|ruby=Bulletphiles' Black Market|  ~ 100th Black Market ||||jp=バレットフィリア達の闇市場　〜 100th Black Market}} is a vertical-scrolling [[danmaku]] game and the "18.5th" official installment of the ''[[Touhou Project]]'', featuring [[Marisa Kirisame]] as the playable character and main protagonist. The game is a follow-up to ''[[Unconnected Marketeers]]'', featuring a modified version of its Ability Card system, as well as previous scene-based games such as ''[[Impossible Spell Card]]'' and ''[[Violet Detector]]''. It is scheduled for release on August 14, 2022, at [[Comiket 100]].

==Gameplay==
{{Main|/Gameplay|l1=Gameplay|100th Black Market/Gameplay/Strategy|l2=Strategy|/Spell Cards|l3=Spell Cards|/Ability Cards|l4=Ability Cards|/Achievements|l5=Achievements}}
''100th Black Market'' consists of several self-contained stages that the player can play through individually. Each stage consists of several enemy waves and boss encounters selected semi-randomly, broken up by card shop menus where the player can purchase more equipment and abilities in the form of Ability Cards (previously featured in ''Unconnected Marketeers''). While a single playthrough is short, repeated playthroughs to acquire more cards and experiment with different strategies are highly encouraged.

==Name and Concept==

==Story==
{{Main|/Translation|l1=Translation|/Characters|l2=Characters}}
Despite [[Chimata Tenkyuu]]'s assertion that her Ability Cards would fall out of fashion after the events of ''Unconnected Marketeers'', the cards' value is still somehow climbing further and further. [[Marisa Kirisame]] sets out to investigate the "black markets" that are trading in cards without Chimata's oversight — and to collect as many cards as she can for herself.

{{thtitle|Touhou |Hyouibana|ruby=Spirit Possession Bloom| ~ Antinomy of Common Flowers|jp=東方憑依華　～ Antinomy of Common Flowers}} is the 15.5th official installment of the ''[[Touhou Project]]'', developed by [[Team Shanghai Alice]] in conjunction with [[Twilight Frontier]]. The game was announced during the ''Play, Doujin! Year-End Party'' stream.

A first demo was released at the [[Reitaisai 14]] with only 4 characters, a second demo was released at [[Autumn Reitaisai 4]] with more characters from [[Urban Legend in Limbo]], and the full version was released at the [[Comiket 93]]. The game was then released on Steam on January 5th, 2018. A demo port on the PlayStation 4 was displayed at Reitaisai 16 on May 5, 2019, while a port for the Nintendo Switch was released on April 22, 2021. 

==Gameplay==
{{Main|/Gameplay|l1=Gameplay|/Spell Cards|l2=Spell Cards}}
The playable characters are paired up as '''Master''' and '''Slave''', and you can manipulate this designation at will.

The player will choose a pair of Master and Slave, and will fight together while switching between each other as a danmaku tag battle.
A Slave can lend the Master her power, occasionally pull her out of a tough spot, and be disposed in times of emergency.

This game also reintroduced on-screen point collection to the fighting game genre.

==Concept==
The game features a similar style and gameplay to its two predecessors: ''[[Urban Legend in Limbo]]'' and ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]''. with continuation of the Occult system.

===Name===
An [[Wikipedia:Antinomy|Antinomy]] is a contradiction between one law, principle, or axiom and another. The word is derived in the Greek roots ''antí'' (against, in opposition to) and ''nómos'' (law).

==Story==
{{Main|/Story|l1=Story|/Translation|l2=Translation|/Characters|l3=Characters|/Stages|l4=Stages}}
A strange phenomenon called "Perfect Possession" is taking place.
A phenomenon where one is taken over by a completely different person, not only in mind but also in body.
But have no worry: Reimu is already on her way to investigate the cause behind its occurrence.

"''The strongest duo have joined forces.''" &lt;br&gt;
"''Something bad may be in store for us humans.''" &lt;br&gt;
"''An opponent impossible to defeat by anybody alone?''" &lt;br&gt;

Ludicrous rumors are circulating, seemingly out of the fear in human villagers' hearts.

The so-called "[[Urban Legend in Limbo|Urban Legend Incidents]]", yet to be resolved, have bestowed unsubstantiable rumors with a tendency to manifest in concrete forms.
And this time, the Perfect Possession is obviously yet another Urban Legend Incident.

This story is about those who keep watch on Perfect Possession, those who exploit it, those unwittingly dragged into it, and those working to expose the threat behind it...&lt;br/&gt;
Those who have made the mistake of seeing themselves as the strongest duo. This is a bittersweet story about them.

The game was announced by ZUN on December 11th, 2016, at the ''Play, Doujin! Year-End Party'' stream showing the name and logo of the game. The official page was created later containing a short prologue.

On April 24th, 2017, the official page was updated with a single screenshot from the game showing a duo fight, and a basic description of how the gameplay would be like.

A trial version was released on May 7th, 2017 during [[Reitaisai|Reitaisai 14]].

The website has also been updated to show more in-game screenshots. You can see a roster of characters including all previous characters from [[Urban Legend in Limbo]] and also 5 spaces for 4 additional characters and 1 random button.

On October 5th, 2017, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vktkP0xfukE an official PV] was released, specifying that Ichirin and Nitori will appear in the Autumn Reitaisai 4 demo, and revealing [[Doremy Sweet]] as a new playable character.

In version 0.02, the characters selection screen's user interface changed significantly. Doremy's and the three other new playable's icon were not indicated in this version. A question mark was displayed for each of these four icons instead of the character's face. Moreover, playable characters from Touhou 14.5 had icons shaded grey and could not be selected. The random button also received it's icon displaying two crisscrossing green arrows.

Version 0.02 not only added characters, but also added a stage and stage theme. The Palanquin Ship Flies in the Sky （聖輦船空を行く） is U2's new work for the stage Treasure Ship Above the Clouds (雲上の宝船).

During the 86th edition of the [[Nikenme Radio]] show&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrR1Y2BP-9M&lt;/ref&gt; on October 30th, 2017, Tasofro announced that they were preparing a Steam release for the game. It was later confirmed by an entry on Tasofro blog&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20171215013444/http://tasofro.net/diary/view/159&lt;/ref&gt; along with their plan to release the complete version of the game at [[Comiket 93]].

On December 18th, 2017, Tasofro revealed [[Tenshi Hinanawi]] as a playable character on their Twitter account&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/tasofro/status/942684648190046208&lt;/ref&gt;.

On December 21st, 2017, Tasofro revealed [[Yukari Yakumo]] as a playable character on their Twitter account&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/tasofro/status/943768666947981313&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 27th, 2017, Tasofro announced plans for an English translation&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/tasofro/status/945990580470820864&lt;/ref&gt;. It was released in the 1.10 version of the game, on April 24th, 2018.

{{thtitle|Touhou |Kishinjou|ruby=Shining Needle Castle| ~ Double Dealing Character|jp=東方輝針城　～ Double Dealing Character}} is the fourteenth official game of the ''[[Touhou Project]]''. It was announced by [[ZUN]] on his personal blog on May 11, 2013.&lt;ref name="blog_announcement"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kourindou.exblog.jp/20469044/|title=東方Project 第14弾の情報です|author=[[ZUN]]|work=Invisible Games and Japanese|publisher=[[Team Shanghai Alice]]|date=11 May 2013|language=ja|accessdate=10 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A playable demo containing the first three stages was released on May 26, 2013, at [[Reitaisai|Reitaisai 10]]. The full game was released on August 12, 2013, at [[Comiket 84]]. 

It is the first game in the series to be made available for digital download, through Playism. This release is also the first available in western territories, though it is untranslated from the original Japanese.

==Gameplay==
{{Main|/Gameplay|l1=Gameplay|/Gameplay/Strategy|l2=Strategy|/Spell Cards|l3=Spell Cards}}

''Double Dealing Character'' resembles ''[[Ten Desires]]'' with the overall package, but with a visual upgrade due to doubling the resolution. [[ZUN]] focused on simpler gameplay for this entry, which results in a game that brings to mind ''[[the Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]]'' or ''[[Subterranean Animism]]'' in simplicity.

The three main playable characters are [[Reimu Hakurei]], [[Marisa Kirisame]], and [[Sakuya Izayoi]], each of which have two different shot types. Like with recent previous games, lives and bombs are gained piece by piece. The player requires 3 life pieces to gain an extra life. 8 bomb pieces grants the player an additional bomb, and this amount never changes. Bosses may also drop bomb or life pieces.

The major new gameplay mechanic is a simple upgrade to the Item Get auto-collection system. When you auto-collect, either by passing the [[Item Get Border Line]], using a bomb, or reaching/defeating a boss, you will get bonus points and resource pieces based on the amount of power and point items auto-collected within a certain timing window. You get bomb pieces at 20 items and life pieces at 60, though every fifth bomb piece is replaced with another life piece.

Returning from ''[[Ten Desires]]'' is Spell Practice mode, as well as the ability to unlock a stage for Practice mode simply by reaching it. Not returning is having to beat Normal difficulty to unlock the Extra Stage.

==Story==
{{Main|/Story|l1=Story|/Translation|l2=Translation|/Characters|l3=Characters}}
[[Youkai]] are rebelling, and tsukumogami are turning up; no one knows what's happening, clouds are gathering, and a strong wind carries the sounds of a huge building. Gensokyo is full of the sounds of dissonance. The individual weapons of the three protagonists are starting to act oddly. It's their job to either take their weapons in hand and fight the youkai, or to cast their weapons aside.

==Press==
''Double Dealing Character'' was first announced on ZUN's personal blog on May 11, 2013, along with a short explanation of the gameplay, confirmation on the playable characters and five in-development screenshots. It also included a basic story outline.&lt;ref name="blog_announcement" /&gt; On July 19, 2013, ZUN updated his blog announcing that the web demo was available for download in the official [[Team Shanghai Alice]] page with minor bug fixes along with a short intro story.

In his original blog announcement, ZUN stated that the resolution of the game would be doubled from 640×480 to 1280×960. He also said that the game was being developed to be resolution-independent, but that those with higher-end computers would be able to enjoy the higher resolution.

Four days after the release of the full game at [[Comiket 84]], ZUN released a v1.00b patch to fix bugs, such as the crash that happened with certain characters after stage 4. 

On August 10, 2014, both ZUN and [[wikipedia:Playism|Playism]] confirmed a digital download for the game, available on the site of Playism.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/korindo/status/498700083521536001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/playismJP/status/498698271666106369&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 7, 2015, Playism announced that it would bring the game to western territories.&lt;ref&gt;http://playism-games.com/article/touhou-finally-coming-to-the-west&lt;/ref&gt; The release date was later announced for May 7.&lt;ref&gt;http://playism-games.com/article/touhou-14-hits-playism-on-5-7-2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
{{Main|/Music|l1=Music}}
''Double Dealing Character'' has a total of 17 tracks composed by [[ZUN]], with seven stage and seven boss themes, a title screen theme, an ending theme and a staff roll theme. A hidden track 18 is the new Player's Score theme from ''[[Fairy Wars]]''. 

It also was the first main game to not use the title form "xxxx Dream" on the staff roll theme since [[Story of Eastern Wonderland]]

Just like the other [[Windows]] games, the title screen theme is based on "[[Theme of Eastern Story]]". Additionally, the stage 3 theme "[[Double Dealing Character/Music#Stage 3 theme|Bamboo Forest of the Full Moon]]" and the stage 4 boss theme "[[Double Dealing Character/Music#Stage 4 Boss - Benben Tsukumo's and Yatsuhashi Tsukumo's theme|Illusionary Joururi]]" also adapt the melody from this theme. Later on, [[Seija Kijin]]'s theme "[[Double Dealing Character/Music#Stage 5 Boss - Seija Kijin's theme|Reverse Ideology]]" was re-used for the [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2XZ1w-vvwI official trailer] for ''[[Impossible Spell Card]]'' as well as in the game itself. Two other themes ("[[Double Dealing Character/Music#Stage 1 Boss - Wakasagihime's theme|Mermaid from the Uncharted Land]]" and "[[Double Dealing Character/Music#Stage 4 Boss - Benben Tsukumo's and Yatsuhashi Tsukumo's theme|Illusionary Joururi]]") are also present in said game.

==Additional Information==
*The game's Japanese name ({{lang|ja|輝'''針'''城}}) is the name of the [[Shining Needle Castle]], which was the base [[Shinmyoumaru Sukuna]] and [[Seija Kijin]] were using in the game, and Shinmyoumaru's current place of residence. It also contains the character for "needle" ({{lang|ja|針}}) in Shinmyoumaru's given name ({{lang|ja|'''針'''妙丸}}). Double Dealing Character in the title may in turn refer to Seija Kijin, as she was trying to trick Shinmyoumaru into following her plans, and Double Dealer is the name of a boss in [[Wikipedia:Darius Gaiden|Darius Gaiden]] that flips itself over in the middle of the fight. This follows the trend of the mainline games' names referencing their final bosses or other important characters.

{{thtitle|Double Spoiler ~ Touhou |Bunkachou|ruby=Word Flower Album||jp=ダブルスポイラー　～ 東方文花帖}} is a [[danmaku]] vertical-scrolling photography game and the "12.5th" official installment of the ''[[Touhou Project]]''. It was released between ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]'' (12.3) and ''[[Fairy Wars]]'' (12.8). It is a follow-up to ''[[Shoot the Bullet]]'', which is similar in both gameplay and concept.

==Gameplay==
{{Main|/Gameplay|l1=Gameplay|/Spell Cards|l2=Spell Cards}}
In ''Double Spoiler'', you can play as [[Aya Shameimaru]] or, after you unlocked her, [[Hatate Himekaidou]]. Like in ''[[Shoot the Bullet]]'', the heroines must take pictures of various bosses and their bullet patterns while avoiding them as well. The player gains points for taking certain kinds of pictures, such as getting Aya or Hatate in the shot with the boss, taking pictures of bullets primarily of a single color, or taking pictures while grazing bullets. The player must take all these aspects into account in order to achieve good scores and enable a comment from both. Unlike in the last game, the camera's orientation can be modified: it can be either portrait or landscape, and can be changed during the game. Aya always starts with a landscape orientation, and Hatate with a portrait orientation. The bosses included in this game come from the games ''[[Mountain of Faith]]'' to ''[[Undefined Fantastic Object]]''.

==Name and Concept==
''Double Spoiler'' is the sequel to ''Shoot the Bullet'', and it is the second entry in the ''Touhou Bunkachou'' ({{lang|ja|東方文花帖}}) side series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kourindou.exblog.jp/12243476/|title=東方Project 第12.5弾|author=[[ZUN]]|date=2010-03-03|language=ja|accessdate=August 27, 2011|quote=今回はおまけ的な扱いだった東方文花帖の第二弾となります。}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the first ''[[Touhou Project]]'' title to have [[wikipedia:Katakana|Katakana]] in its name. Interestingly, on the jewel case, the transliteration of the Katakana word ''Double Spoiler'' ({{lang|ja|ダブルスポイラー}}) is misspelled as ''Double Spoier''.

This game shares the same concept as its predecessor: you start as [[Aya Shameimaru]] and take pictures of a boss character from one of the previous games. Also, a certain amount of "[[spell card]] captures" is required to proceed to the next stage. In the previous game, the bare minimum was three spell cards from each stage. This has been changed in this game: the bare minimum requirements decrease as the difficulty of the game increases, making it easier for players to unlock all of the stages.

According to [[ZUN]], the difficulty is set much higher then usual, as people will not discover Touhou with this game. Hence, it is harder to achieve an 'all-clear' in this game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kourindou.exblog.jp/12243476/|title=東方Project 第12.5弾|author=[[ZUN]]|date=2010-03-03|language=ja|accessdate=August 27, 2011|quote=＊注、他の作品に比べ（オールクリアの）難易度は高いので、鍛えておいてくださいね。}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Story==
{{Main|/Translation|l1=Translation|/Characters|l2=Characters}}
Aya Shameimaru, the [[tengu]] reporter, runs the "[[Bunbunmaru Newspaper]]". She looks for and takes pictures of [[human]]s, [[youkai]] and any other beings that may be interesting to write about. Another tengu, [[Hatate Himekaidou]], runs the "[[Kakashi Spirit News]]", fuelled by her thoughtography. Hatate, wondering why Aya's seemingly ridiculous newspaper is so popular, decides to observe Aya as she gathers her news. This section of the story takes place as the player controls Aya. Upon reaching the Spoiler stage, the two meet, and Hatate declares war on Aya and her newspaper, expressing her disapproval of the tabloid, sensationalist nature of her newspaper. Hatate's journey is represented through the player replaying the game as her, seeing her take on the events Aya has covered.

==Music==
[[File:Th125CongratulationsScreen.png|thumb|225px|The congratulations screen when you unlock Hatate.]]
{{Main|/Music|l1=Music}}
The soundtrack of ''Double Spoiler'' has six named tracks and one unnamed track. The unnamed track cannot be heard in the music room, and can only be heard when you have unlocked Hatate after clearing the Spoiler stage. Like the other games, the title screen theme of Double Spoiler is an arranged version of "Theme of Eastern Story" from ''[[Akyu's Untouched Score vol.5]]''. The fifth photo theme, "The Youkai Mountain ~ Mysterious Mountain" ({{lang|ja|妖怪の山　～}} Mysterious Mountain), is a slightly different version of [[Aya Shameimaru|Aya]]'s theme in ''[[Mountain of Faith]]'', sharing the same name. 

According to the music comments, the music changes when the difficulty of the game steps up a notch. [[ZUN]] claims that the fifth track, "Bell of Avici ~ Infinite Nightmare" ({{lang|ja|無間の鐘　～}} Infinite Nightmare), is the one the player will hear the most, describing it as 'an endless hell'. This is because this theme plays during the hardest parts of the game. 

Four days after the release of ''Double Spoiler'', ''[[Oriental Sacred Place]] 1'' was released, with a ''[[Oriental Sacred Place 1 (CD)|CD]]'' included. One of the CD's tracks is "Youkai Modern Colony" ({{lang|ja|妖怪モダンコロニー}}), which is the full version of song from ''Double Spoiler'', according to ZUN. "Bell of Avici ~ Infinite Nightmare" was also slightly arranged and featured in the 5.5th album of "ZUN's Music Collection", ''[[Unknown Flower, Mesmerizing Journey]]'' ({{lang|ja|未知の花 魅知の旅}}).

==Press==
ZUN announced this game on his blog ''[[Invisible Games and Japanese]]'' on the 3rd of March, 2010, a few days before its full release at [[:Category:Reitaisai 7|Reitaisai 7]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kourindou.exblog.jp/12243476/|title=東方Project 第12.5弾|author=[[ZUN]]|date=2010-03-03|language=ja|accessdate=August 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; To date, no new versions of the game have been released, even though the full version features some notable bugs, especially on spell card 12-6.

{{thtitle|Touhou |Koumakyou|ruby=Scarlet Devil Land| ~ the Embodiment of Scarlet Devil|jp=東方紅魔郷　～ the Embodiment of Scarlet Devil}} is a vertical-scrolling [[danmaku]] [[shooting game|shoot 'em up]], and is the sixth official game in the ''[[Touhou Project]]'' by [[Team Shanghai Alice]]'s sole member [[ZUN]]. It is the first to be released specifically for the [[Windows|Windows operating system]] and a "clean break" from the [[PC-98]] era.

==Gameplay==
{{Main|/Gameplay|l1=Gameplay|/Strategy|l2=Strategy|/Spell Cards|l3=Spell Cards}}

''the Embodiment of Scarlet Devil'' follows on from the PC-98 titles and ''[[Seihou]]'' in terms of basic gameplay, but makes certain key changes. The biggest change is the introduction of the [[Spell Card]] system. The pacing was also changed to a great degree, but some aspects of the PC-98 and ''Seihou'' "fast patterns" pacing remain in this game, which has given ''the Embodiment of Scarlet Devil'' a reputation for having a higher difficulty than later games. The following games, ''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]'' and ''[[Imperishable Night]]'', would mostly remove this kind of pacing.

''the Embodiment of Scarlet Devil'' once again features two playable characters to choose from with two equipment types each, much like ''[[Lotus Land Story]]''. [[Reimu Hakurei]] can cover a wide area of the screen with weaker attacks, while [[Marisa Kirisame]] relies on speed and power to make up for a thinner attack spread. Each character and type has its own bomb as well, now called Spell Cards.

Another change from ''Lotus Land Story'' and ''[[Mystic Square]]'' is the introduction of an "Item Get" feature, which allows you to collect all items on the screen by moving to the top of the screen if you are at full power. This mechanic would appear in all later games.

One thing that remains from the PC-98 titles: there are six total stages in the main game, but playing on Easy difficulty will end the game after Stage 5. Completing Normal difficulty is once again required to unlock the Extra Stage as well.

==Concept==
[[ZUN]]'s general goal when creating ''the Embodiment of Scarlet Devil'' was to stay away from systems appearing in newer shoot 'em ups, which he thought overly complicated the games, and to let the player have fun simply dodging bullets.&lt;ref&gt;[[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil/Afterword|the Embodiment of Scarlet Devil: Afterword]] — "''Touhou Koumakyou'' brings things back to the starting point, by curbing the game systems that change the difficulty in obscure ways, while focusing on the natural fun of dodging bullets at the same time."&lt;/ref&gt; When he started creating the game it was first named {{nihongo|Touhou Kouchakan|東方紅茶館|lit. "Eastern Scarlet Teahouse"}}, with the stage 3 theme being in reference to the name. However, ZUN felt the name didn't match the game's story so eventually it got changed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|page=22 |author=ZUN |date=11 August 2005 |work=東方文花帖　～ Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red|publisher= |accessdate=28 April 2016|language= Japanese|title=幻想の音覚}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the first [[Windows]] game, the engine was written from scratch using the DirectX API - with help from a few libraries from [[Amusement Makers]] - and ZUN apologizes for the seeming lack of creativity with things like grunt enemies, citing a lack of manpower while concentrating on building up libraries and tools himself.&lt;ref name="after"&gt;[[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil/Afterword|the Embodiment of Scarlet Devil: Afterword]]&lt;/ref&gt; This particular engine would later be used for the games ''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]'', ''[[Imperishable Night]]'', and ''[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]''.

ZUN has mentioned in an interview&lt;ref&gt;"The Chief Priest ZUN talks about Mountain of Faith!" Chara☆Mel Vol.3, Ichijinsha, Dec 2007, pp.104-111.&lt;/ref&gt; that because it was the first Windows game, he decided to go with the concept of ''Embodiment of Scarlet Devil'' as a {{nihongo||[[wikipedia:ja:落ち#出落ち|出落ち]]|deochi|lit. "[[w:Punch line|punch line]] on the entrance"}} as a main theme. Examples include having the game take place in a [[Scarlet Devil Mansion|Western setting]] and bringing in Western youkai as bosses even though the series is named ''Touhou'' ("Eastern").

==Story==
{{Main|/Story|l1=Story|/Translation|l2=Translation|/Characters|l3=Characters}}
''During a peaceful summer in [[Gensokyo]], an unnatural scarlet mist appears without warning and covers much of the land. It is strong enough to block out the sun, causing the affected areas to become dark and cold. [[Reimu Hakurei]], a [[shrine maiden]] working at the [[Hakurei Shrine]], and [[Marisa Kirisame]], a [[magician]], set out to find the source of the mist. Their search will lead them to the [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]] and to its eccentric owners...''

==Music==
{{Main|/Music|l1=Music}}
Like [[Kioh Gyoku]], which was released a few months earlier, the soundtrack for this game was originally made with the Roland SC-88Pro [[w:MIDI|MIDI]] module. However, before the game's release, ZUN arranged and re-recorded the tracks using the Roland Edirol SD-90, which ZUN got in late 2001.&lt;ref name="bulletinboard"/&gt; 

Two separate versions of the soundtrack with seventeen tracks each were included in the game. The WAV version is based on ZUN's later arrangement of the soundtrack, and mark a significant step up from the FM synthesis ZUN used for the PC-98 games. The MIDI version is based on the original compositions, and will only play correctly on an SC-88Pro. Recordings of the MIDI versions made using this module can be found [https://www.shrinemaiden.org/forum/index.php/topic,18989.0.html here].

ZUN was aiming to give the music a "brighter" feel over the [[PC-98]] games by attempting to add jazz fusion elements to the tracks. He goes on to say that ''Septette for a Dead Princess'' and ''U.N. Owen was her?'' were the songs he most thought of as representative of ''the Embodiment of Scarlet Devil''.&lt;ref name="after"/&gt; Incidentally, these two songs are among the tunes most popular in the fandom.

''Shanghai Alice of Meiji 17'' and ''U.N. Owen was her?'' would later appear in the music album ''[[Dolls in Pseudo Paradise]]'', with the former being the original version of the track.&lt;ref name="bulletinboard"&gt;[[ZUN's reply to messages on the former Gensou Bulletin Board 1]]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Shanghai Scarlet Teahouse ~ Chinese Tea'' would also be arranged for ''[[Changeability of Strange Dream]]'', and ''Locked Girl ~ The Girl's Sealed Room'' for ''[[Retrospective 53 minutes]]''. ''U.N. Owen was her?'' was also arranged for a CD extra that came with the first volume of ''[[Strange and Bright Nature Deity]]'', where it was redone to carry a more suitable tone for the manga.

In addition, ''Tomboyish Girl In Love'' would later be arranged in ''Phantasmagoria of Flower View'' retitled ''Adventure of the Lovestruck Tomboy''.

==Press==
''the Embodiment of Scarlet Devil'' was first announced on ZUN's website on April 15, 2002, approximately three and a half years after the release of ''Mystic Square''. At this time, it was being developed under the name {{nihongo|"Eastern Scarlet Teahouse"|東方紅茶館|Touhou Kouchakan}}; it was changed to the current name afterwards. Beginning with an early trial version on June 10, 2002, the trial versions went through a number of revisions until the game's final release at [[:Category:Comiket 62|Comiket 62]] on August 11, 2002. Patches would be released up until late that November, ending on version 1.02h.

In addition to its normal release, ZUN also released an exclusive Extra stage demo to doujin shops such as Tora no Ana and Akibaoukoku. In this version, the last part of the boss is much harder.&lt;ref name="bulletinboard"/&gt;

==Reception==
The characters of ''the Embodiment of Scarlet Devil'' continue to be some of the most popular ones in the [[Touhou Project]]. In particular, [[Sakuya Izayoi]] has consistently been in the top 4 in the [[THWiki Popularity Poll|Touhou Popularity Contests]] held by the Japanese Touhou Wiki since its inception after [[:Category:Comiket 63|Comiket 63]]. [[Remilia Scarlet]] and [[Flandre Scarlet]] continue to be well-loved characters, as well. In addition to the ever-popular ''Septette for the Dead Princess'' and ''U.N. Owen was Her?'', songs such as ''Shanghai Alice in Meiji 17'' and ''Shanghai Scarlet Teahouse ~ Chinese Tea'' gained much recognition.

:''For the unofficial replica based on this game, see [[Gold Rush (Remake)]].''
{{nihongo||弾幕アマノジャク　ゴールドラッシュ|'''[[Danmaku]] [[Amanojaku]] Gold Rush'''}} is a one-[[stage]] [[danmaku]] mini game&lt;ref name="SMF1"&gt;[https://www.shrinemaiden.org/forum/index.php?topic=17617.0 Maidens of the Kaleidoscope - ZUN and Touhou Status 2]&lt;/ref&gt; and publicly-unreleased installment of the ''[[Touhou Project]]'', featuring [[Seija Kijin]] as the sole playable character and [[Reimu Hakurei]] as the sole stage boss. The game was created for Digital Game Expo 2014's "Doujin Shooting Game Caravan" contest, where it was available to be played. The game was not ever meant to be sold or played outside of the event&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/korindo/status/533521707504381952&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/korindo/status/533073899441750017&lt;/ref&gt; and was made in only two days&lt;ref name="twodays"&gt;https://twitter.com/korindo/status/533071698946318336&lt;/ref&gt;, so it is possible it might never be released to the public. It was made available again to be played on the 2017 Digital Game Expo, along with all of ZUN's previous official games and music CDs (including the five [[PC-98]] games, although these could not be bought and could only be played at the event).

==Gameplay==
{{Main|/Spell Cards|l1=Spell Cards}}
The player controls [[Seija Kijin]]. She has two "cheat" items available, functioning similarly to ''[[Impossible Spell Card]]''. Unlike ''Impossible Spell Card'', however, Seija cannot shoot. As her secondary item, she uses the {{nihongo|Substitute Jizo|身代わり地蔵}}, which allows her to be hit up to a maximum of five times, and as her primary item she uses a 10th "rule-breaking" item, the {{nihongo|[[Miracle Mallet]] (Real)|打ち出の小槌（本物）}}, which destroys hit danmaku and chains along all the danmaku surrounding it, and converts them all into ''[[koban]]'' coins. This is somewhat similar to [[Cirno]]'s "perfect freeze" in ''[[Fairy Wars]]''. The Miracle Mallet can be used infinitely, unlike the items in ''Impossible Spell Card'', but it carries a small lag period between each use.

Described as a short "score attack" game, Seija's goal is to achieve the highest score possible by transforming [[Reimu Hakurei]]'s danmaku into ''koban'' coins in only a few minutes with no continues. The screen goes straight to the title immediately after the score is shown because there is no "continue". The game also saves all the play history automatically as replays, so that they could be viewed at any time.&lt;ref name="SMF2" /&gt; Scores are displayed in the value of modern day yen; the way the score converts koban to yen is:&lt;ref name="SMF2"&gt;[https://www.shrinemaiden.org/forum/index.php/topic,17629.0.html Maidens of the Kaleidoscope - Touhou 14.5 announced at Digital Game Expo 2014!]&lt;/ref&gt;

 (Your score) × 8932

There is only one [[stage]] in the game. The title of the stage is:
* {{nihongo|'''Scene EX''' – Monetary Easing in Another Dimension|シーンEX　異次元の金融緩和}}

==Concept==
[[File:ThGRZUN'sBooth.jpg|thumb|250px|Photo of ZUN's booth featuring ''GR'']]
''Danmaku Amanojaku Gold Rush'' is [[ZUN]]'s first non-packaged game since ''[[Uwabami Breakers]]''. ZUN announced the game on the 14th of November, 2014‎ as a minigame for the Digital Game Expo 2014 convention and its "Doujin Shooting Game Caravan" competition, where participants would play a number of short games for score. He hadn't even started creating the game beforehand, spending less than two days creating it&lt;ref name="twodays"/&gt;. Using ''Impossible Spell Card'''s engine, ZUN made this game with a low difficulty and a short length, since the sole purpose is to score attack. ZUN stated that "You can beat it in about two minutes in one playthrough," and that it was "built only for playing at that place, containing nothing marketable."&lt;ref name="SMF1" /&gt; The people who attended could only have one try at playing the game in one sitting. After the player finished their run, their score was recorded on a sheet alongside their scores for other games in the competition.&lt;ref name="SMF2" /&gt; Once they completed and submitted their whole score sheet, they could get a new one and try again.

On the title screen, the text below the title reads "Special Game for Digital Game Expo Score Attack". The title screen also contains coins that resemble the [[Wikipedia:Canadian Gold Maple Leaf|Canadian Gold Maple Leaf]] bullion coin. The stage title "Monetary Easing in Another Dimension" is implicitly related to [[Wikipedia:Quantitative easing|quantitative easings]] led by [[Wikipedia:Haruhiko Kuroda|Haruhiko Kuroda]], governor of the Bank of Japan. ZUN's impression of the quantitative easing declared on November 31st in 2014 was such that he decided that the game should be generous and gorgeous, feeling like a temporary monetary bubble.

On a strange note, although Seija is said to fight Reimu at the [[Hakurei Shrine]], the stage's background appears to be the [[Moriya Shrine]] from ''[[Subterranean Animism]]'' with different effects. This is likely because, prior to ''[[Hidden Star in Four Seasons]]'', the Hakurei Shrine was not used as a background in a Windows Touhou game, and given two days, using the already-finished Moriya Shrine was the easiest option.

===Name===
This is the second official ''Touhou Project'' game that does not bear the kanji {{nihongo|Touhou|東方}} in its title, the first being ''[[Impossible Spell Card]]''. Just like ''Impossible Spell Card'', the Japanese part of the title is composed of {{nihongo|"[[danmaku]]"|弾幕}}, referring to the main theme or genre of the game, while {{nihongo|[[Amanojaku]]|アマノジャク}} refers to the playable character's species: [[Seija Kijin]]. The name of the game also describes the goal, which is to transform danmaku into gold coins and gather as much of it as quickly as possible.

==Story==
Following ''[[Impossible Spell Card]]'', somehow acquiring the ultimate rule-breaking item, the [[Miracle Mallet]] (Real), Seija sets about robbing the [[Hakurei Shrine]] of its assets before the Miracle Mallet's power runs out. 
Also explaining the oddity of the scenario, when asked by fans about why Seija can use the Miracle Mallet, which only the [[Inchling]]s can use, his answer was: she can't; the game was made in a short amount of time, with no consideration for the setting at all.&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.livedoor.jp/tohomemory/archives/41324779.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Aerium/status/533868433490718720&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
There are two songs in the game, the ''[[Impossible Spell Card]]'' Title Screen theme, "Raise the Signal Fire of Cheating" and [[Shinmyoumaru Sukuna]]'s Stage 6 Boss theme from ''[[Double Dealing Character]]'', "Inchlings of the Shining Needle ~ Little Princess". Both were said by ZUN to be arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/nagatam/status/533979576766955525 Twitter on ZUN's themes]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{thtitle||Yousei Daisensou|ruby=Great Fairy Wars|&amp;nbsp;~ Touhou {{ruby|Sangetsusei|Three Fairies}}|jp=妖精大戦争　～ 東方三月精}} is a vertical "[[danmaku]] freezing" game. It is considered the "12.8th" official installment of the ''[[Touhou Project]]'', being released between ''[[Double Spoiler]]'' (12.5) and ''[[Ten Desires]]'' (13). It is also based on the ''[[Touhou Sangetsusei]]'' manga series, sharing its Japanese name with said manga series.

==Gameplay==
{{Main|/Gameplay|l1=Gameplay|/Strategy|l2=Strategy|/Spell Cards|l3=Spell Cards}}
''Great Fairy Wars'' is a vertical "[[danmaku]] freezing" game. Here, only one character can be controlled, and only has one "shot type". Besides the normal shot, an extra addition is the feature of freezing bullets that are shot at her. Almost any bullet will freeze if it comes in contact with the ice resulting in long, elaborate chains of ice. The bomb is not that regular. It is named the "perfect freeze" which will also freeze the bullets, but now which are at the whole screen. Instead of getting a live or bombs via a power-up, Cirno has a "motivation" which will start at 200% and will slowly increase. The same is for the perfect freeze, which uses a percentage. Each time you use the bomb, the perfect freeze meter will decrease by 100%. If the meter is lower then 100%, you cannot use it. The meter itself can increase all the way to 300%, contrary to what it says in the manual. At last, the shot power also uses a percentage, which will add more power every time a certain percentage is reached.

Whereas the normal games have six stages, ''Great Fairy Wars'' has three stages that may be traveled by one of six routes. ''Great Fairy Wars'' also has an Extra stage, unlocked after completing all routes.

==Concept==
''Great Fairy Wars'' is a continuation of the story in the ''[[Strange and Bright Nature Deity]]'' volume 2 special "Fairy Wars", released on February 18th, 2009.

The game was announced and released more than a year after the release of the special chapter. However, [[ZUN]] did hint at some sort of sequel at the end of the chapter,&lt;ref&gt;[[Strange and Bright Nature Deity]] vol. 2: Special Chapter "Great Fairy Wars" — "Special Chapter - Continued... maybe?"&lt;/ref&gt; as well as another shooter game in ''[[Strange and Bright Nature Deity 2 (CD)|Strange and Bright Nature Deity 2 CD]]'' in the comments of track 1 describing the chapter as "the opening story to a normal shooting game".

The game was intended to be short and easier to play through, since the protagonists were all fairies, thus there are only three stages. It did not have any complex dialogue and the story was easy to step into, even though the game is a follow-up to the special.

As stated in the [[Great Fairy Wars/Translation/Afterword|afterword]], the title ''Yousei Daisensou'' is a parody of the title of ''[[Wikipedia:The Great Yokai War|Youkai Daisensou]]'', a film by [[Wikipedia:Takashi Miike|Takashi Miike]] and produced by [[Wikipedia:Kadokawa|Kadokawa]]. As the comic is published by the same studio, [[ZUN]] tried to have a little fun with the title. The length of the game was intended to be even shorter, but ZUN decided that making such short games was useless and not interesting for him. He attempted to make a longer game, but ran out of time and ended up with the final product of three stages and an Extra stage.

ZUN felt that the game art should be done by the manga artist, so [[Makoto Hirasaka]] drew the portraits for the game. It is the first game developed by ZUN himself that does not use his own art, ''[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]'' notwithstanding.

==Story==
{{Main|/Story|l1=Story|/Translation|l2=Translation|/Characters|l3=Characters}}
In the previous winter, the [[Three Fairies of Light]] wanted to gather other fairies to cooperate with each other. They decided that the only way to do so was with force, so they destroyed [[Cirno]]'s house. Cirno mistook this as a declaration of war. 

The following spring, after searching at various locations she finally meets all three of them at once, so she could punish them.

Cirno was convinced she was the strongest, and would challenge anyone who looks strong. [[Aya Shameimaru]] said that there were some humans done with flower viewings, and that is where Cirno found [[Marisa Kirisame]].

==Music==
{{Main|/Music|l1=Music}}
''Great Fairy Wars'' only holds 10 different tracks. The ninth track is based on the title theme. The last track is a new Player's Score theme, arranged from the original in ''[[Mountain of Faith]]'' to ''[[Undefined Fantastic Object]]'', and has been used in ''[[Ten Desires]]'', ''[[Double Dealing Character]]'', and ''[[Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom]]'' so far. Four tracks are used for stage themes and three for boss themes. For the first and second stage's boss fight the same track, "Staking Your Life on a Prank", is used. At stage 3 when you will meet the Three Fairies of Light the same theme is used, thus only [[Marisa Kirisame]] has her own theme. The first stage theme "The Refrain of the Lovely Great War") was first used in the music CD (''[[Strange and Bright Nature Deity 2 (CD)|{{lang|ja|東方三月精　～}} Strange and Bright Nature Deity 2]]'') that accompanied ''[[Strange and Bright Nature Deity]]''. [[ZUN]] said in the music comments that even though it is the same track, you still will get different feelings hearing it as a stage theme. On the music comments at the CD the idea of the "Great Fairy Wars" was already planned, and ZUN said some of his thoughts about the game, and that the said theme could be some sort of "intro" to a new story, which it eventually became. [[File:Th128FailyWarsTypo.jpg|thumb|300px|The typo in the musicroom.]]

The theme for [[Marisa Kirisame]] in the extra stage was originally planned to be an arrangement of Marisa's theme in ''[[Shuusou Gyoku]]''. ZUN claims to have forgotten the original song, the end result being that this new theme is something completely different.

In the Music Room of ''Great Fairy Wars'', the subtitle for the stage 3 boss theme is misspelled as "Faily Wars", though "Fairy Wars" clearly appears in the song's description and in the bottom right corner of gameplay.

On March 2011, the music CD ''[[Oriental Sacred Place 2 (CD)|{{lang|ja|東方三月精　～}} Oriental Sacred Place 2]]'' was released. It has three tracks, all originating from ''Great Fairy Wars'': "Year-Round Absorbed Curiosity", "A Midnight Fairy Dance" and "Great Fairy Wars ~ Fairy Wars".

==Press==
{{stub|section}}
The game's first announcement was at [[ZUN]] his [[Invisible Games and Japanese|blog]] in 23 July 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kourindou.exblog.jp/12990219/|title=夏コミ情報|date=2010-07-23|accessdate=2011-10-26|author=[[ZUN]]|work=Blog: Invisible Games and Japanese|language=ja|trans-title=Summer Comiket Info}}&lt;/ref&gt; A month later ZUN noted some issues with the [[Wikipedia:Windows 2000|Windows 2000]] compatibility. In the same blog he also noted that the difficulty "formula" is the same, just like any other Touhou game. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kourindou.exblog.jp/13075165/|title=連絡とお詫び|date=2010-08-12|accessdate=2011-10-26|author=[[ZUN]]|work=Blog: Invisible Games and Japanese|language=ja|trans-title=Contact and Apoligies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final version was sold at [[:Category:Comiket 78|Comiket 78]] for 1000 yen. It was on purpose that ZUN did not had any plans for that year's summer Comiket.

{{Main|/Gameplay|l1=Gameplay|/Gameplay/Strategy|l2=Strategy|/Spell Cards|l3=Spell Cards}}
There are four playable characters, each of which has a season assigned to them that determines their shooting type (main season): Reimu Hakurei (spring), Cirno (summer), Aya Shameimaru (fall) and Marisa Kirisame (winter). In addition, a sub-season is initially selected, in which again the four seasons, as well as for the extra stage a fifth, the ex-season.

Shooting enemies, completing Spellcards and Graze creates Season Items, which drop down like other items and can be collected by the player, slowly replenishing Options. Pressing the Release button (default: C) consumes all Options for a Season Release, which can convert orbs into green point items that permanently increase the value of blue point items in a pattern that depends on the sub-season.


The Season display of the summer sub-season to a little under 3 Options.
 
*Spring (Main Season) (Reimu Hakurei): homing cherry blossom petals, little difference between focused and unfocused shot. Number of shots determined by power. Bomb: Large cherry blossoms that circle around the player, destroying bullets and then falling into the boss.

*Spring (Sub-Season) (selectable): A toned-down version of the main season, weak target-seeking shots; Release: Relatively large circle that transforms all the orbs in it in one hit, diameter varies between small and full-screen depending on options.

*Summer (Main Season) (Cirno): Ice crystals in a wide spread that increases when powered and decreases when focused. Bomb: Huge, stationary ice flake that causes permanent damage.

*Summer (Sub-Season) (selectable): Release: Very small circle that persists for a brief moment, but only consumes one option.

*Autumn (Main Season) (Aya Shameimaru): Unfocused wind gusts fly in a slight dispersion, focused ones straight ahead and penetrating. Width determined by power for both types. Bomb: Relatively narrow vertical stationary streak with continuous damage in comparison.

*Autumn (sub-season) (selectable): release: small circle that follows player, duration dependent on options; speed increases during release.

*Winter (Main Season) (Marisa Kirisame): Laser with power-dependent dispersion or straight path when focusing. Bomb: Marisa's well-known "Master Spark", a big, wide laser above the player, which can only move slowly

*Winter (sub-season) (selectable): Release: Medium circle that stays for a while; size and duration depend on options; shooting power is boosted during release.

*Ex-Season (Sub-Season) (only in Extra Stage): Straight with a slight spread and high damage shooting backwards; Release: Like Summer, but with a slight downward movement while shrinking.

==Concept==
Stylistically, Hidden Star in Four Seasons is very varying , with the atmosphere varying from melancholia, intoxicating, or even threatening, which fits well with the environment of the mixed seasons.

In Hidden Star in Four Seasons, ZUN wanted to return in some form to the Touhou parts of the early Windows era. As in older parts, the player is rewarded with Extends through higher scores, the game's own mechanics are significantly less complex than in its predecessors, and the difficulty drops again after Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom. Also, the game's third stage marks Lily White's first midboss appearance since Perfect Cherry Blossom.

===Name===
The "Hidden Star" in the title is referring to [[Okina Matara]], a hidden god of stars. The character {{lang|ja|璋}} in the Japanese half of the name also refers to a dipper, the shape of the constellation of the [[Wikipedia:Big Dipper|Big Dipper]], which Okina holds connections with.

==Story==
{{Main|/Story|l1=Story|/Translation|l2=Translation|/Characters|l3=Characters}}
Despite it being midsummer, the seasons in various locations are completely out of whack. [[Hakurei Shrine]] is showered in cherry petals, the [[Youkai Mountain]] is basking in the middle of autumn, and the [[Forest of Magic]] is blanketed in snow. To add to that, thanks to some strange force, [[Cirno|Gensokyo's]] [[Eternity Larva|fairies]] are running rampant with unfathomable strength. In the midst of this undeniable incident, the heroine sets out to investigate and confront the perpetrator behind it.

==Music==
{{Main|/Music|l1=Music}}
Hidden Star in Four Seasons has 17 new songs, 7 boss themes, 7 stage themes, a title theme, an ending theme and an arrangement of a stage theme for the Staff Roll. Some of the songs are more melancholic. One of the songs, that of the fifth boss fight, is unusually confused and insane.

==Press==
''Hidden Star in Four Seasons'' was first announced on ZUN's blog on April 20, 2017. He confirmed playable characters and posted in-development screenshots. 

He noted that he was aiming for a "light and refreshing feeling" and would like to "return to [his] roots with something that simply aims to make you feel good to play."&lt;!--&lt;ref name="motk_announcement"/&gt;--&gt;
On May 5, ZUN showed the demo CD that would be released at next [[Reitaisai]].

During the 86th edition of the [[Nikenme Radio]] show&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrR1Y2BP-9M|title={{lang|ja|youtube版 ２軒目から始まるラジオ （第86回）}}|language=ja|author=ZUN|date=October 30, 2017|accessdate=November 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; on October 30th, 2017, ZUN announced that a Steam release for the game was planned. This was also mentioned by Tasofro in a blog entry following the show&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tasofro.net/diary/view/159|title={{lang|ja|東方憑依華リリース情報}}|trans-title=Touhou Hyouibana release information|language=ja|author={{lang|ja|海原海豚}}|date=November 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

{{thtitle|Touhou |Reiiden|ruby=Wondrous Tale| ~ The Highly Responsive to Prayers|jp=東方靈異伝　～ The Highly Responsive to Prayers}} is the first game of the ''[[Touhou Project]]'', released for the [[PC-98]].  The game was finished in 1995, but it was shown to the public for the first time at the 20th Hatoyama Matsuri in November 1996.  It was released at [[:Category:Comiket 52|Comiket 52]] alongside ''[[the Story of Eastern Wonderland]]''.

==Gameplay==
{{Main|/Gameplay|l1=Gameplay|/Gameplay/Strategy|l2=Strategy}}
''Highly Responsive to Prayers'' introduces the [[Shrine Maiden]] [[Reimu Hakurei]], who attempts to persuade a bouncing [[Yin-Yang Orb]] to hit various on-screen targets, "cards" and "[[boss]]es" alike. Reimu can manipulate the Yin-Yang Orb by hitting it with her [[wikipedia:Gohei|gohei]], slide-tackling it, or firing shots at it. Enemies attempt to hinder the player's progress by firing at them, but shots can be cancelled with ofuda or deflected by swinging Reimu's gohei.  Only the Yin-Yang Orb can damage enemies; throwing ofuda at enemies has no effect. As a last resort, Reimu can use a bomb to hit all cards on the screen.  There is no guarantee that any given card will be hit, and will often fail to damage a boss.

The game consists of twenty [[stage]]s of increasing difficulty, with a boss fight occurring every five stages. To complete a stage, the player must clear all cards or defeat the boss. Getting hit by a projectile or the Yin-Yang Orb causes the player to lose a life.

There are two selectable paths in ''Highly Responsive to Prayers'' after the fifth stage: the [[Hell]] path and the [[Makai]] path. Each route features unique stages, bosses, and endings.

==Concept==
The gameplay is similar to ''[[wikipedia:Arkanoid|Arkanoid]]'', which clearly differs from games later in the series. Rather than the classic arcade game's paddle, however, you control Reimu, and the ball is allowed to touch the bottom of the screen.

The game takes place in "The Eastern Country", which [[ZUN]] mentions in the text file included with the game to be a "strange, strange world where the shrine maiden lives". [[Gensokyo]] is not named at all; this term was first coined in ''[[Lotus Land Story|Touhou Gensoukyou]]'', and even there it was used only as a game title, up until 2002 when it was finally established as the true name of the world we came to know in [[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]].

===Name===
The game is the first in the series that bears the kanji {{nihongo|Touhou|東方}} on it, along with the first to use the naming scheme "{{lang|ja|東方ＯＯＯ}}". According to the Music Room Special in ''[[Mystic Square]]'', the naming scheme originally came from {{nihongo|''Touhou Kaikidan''|東方怪奇談}} that was composed for this game. It's thought by the Toho-Motoneta Wiki that "{{lang|ja|東方靈異伝}}" is also from {{nihongo|[[wikipedia:Nihon Ryōiki|Nihon Ryouiki]]|日本霊異記||lit. "Ghostly Strange Records from Japan"}}, an early Heian period collection of [[wikipedia:Setsuwa|setsuwa]]. Also, Reimu's PC-98 name bears the kanji "{{lang|ja|靈}}" that's on the game's title.

Although the English subtitle of the title uses the [[wikipedia:Article (grammar)#Definite article|definite article]] "the", it was omitted in ''[[Akyu's Untouched Score vol.5]]''; the reason for this change is unknown. Although the title uses the word "prayer", it can also refer to "player" if mispronounced.

==Story==
{{Main|/Translation|l1=Translation|/Characters|l2=Characters}}
Something has wrecked the [[Hakurei Shrine]], and the resident [[Shrine Maiden]] isn't going to take it lying down. She charges through the gateway into another worlds, intent on locating and punishing the one responsible for the act. Although she isn't capable of harming her enemies directly, she wields an incredible weapon: the [[Yin-Yang Orb]]. With it Reimu will be able to cut a bloody swath through all who stand before her... assuming that she can manage to control it!

The story itself is non-existent throughout the game itself. After [[Stage]] 5, the player can choose either to follow the gate into [[Hell]] or the gate into [[Makai]], each with their own enemies. It is implied that Reimu defeats whoever originally destroyed her shrine. The endings for the game are equally difficult to understand, as depending on which route the player takes, the Yin-Yang Orb will transform into a tiny wish-granting fairy or a joyful, but strange creature that starts smashing parts of the shrine. The bad ending for the game involves the Yin-Yang Orb exploding into a black hole that destroys most of Earth.

Almost all of the characters never appear again except [[Mima]], who appears to reside in the hokora near the [[Hakurei Shrine]]. The names and titles of the [[boss]] characters in this game appear only in the endings.

==Music==
{{Main|Highly Responsive to Prayers/Music|l1=Music}}
The music in ''The Highly Responsive to Prayers'' was listed in-game using abbreviated titles. Additionally, various themes had different titles in their .MDT files (all of which are listed on the main music page linked above).

When ''[[Mystic Square]]'' was released, ZUN gave proper full names to all the songs, and included retroactive composer comments. Aside from the fourteen tracks in the game, there's an unused fifteenth track called "Shrine of the Wind". It's the only PC-98 track that does not appear on ''[[Akyu's Untouched Score]]''.

ZUN's arrangements of "Eastern Strange Discourse" and "[[Eternal Shrine Maiden]]", originally posted on his old music page, would later be re-recorded with another synthesizer and included in his first CD, ''[[Dolls in Pseudo Paradise]]''.

==Press==
''The Highly Responsive to Prayers'' was apparently finished in 1995 (while [[ZUN]] was still attending college), which is why he tends to mention that year as the start of the series. However, the first display of the game to "the public" was at the 20th Hatoyama Matsuri, a local festival of Tokyo University, in November of 1996. It was eventually sold at [[:Category:Comiket 52|Comiket 52]] alongside ''[[Story of Eastern Wonderland]]''. In one of the game's included text files, ZUN states that there wasn't intended to be any overarching story between the two games. ZUN has also said that the game was simply a "study project".&lt;ref name="MU talkshow DoT"&gt;[[Meiji University talkshow "Dawn of Touhou"]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Mystic Square]]'', an arranged version of the game's soundtrack was included, with comments from ZUN. This version of the soundtrack was later released in ''[[Akyu's Untouched Score vol.5]]''.

Since September 19, 2002, all the five [[PC-98]] games have officially stopped being sold, shortly after ''[[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]]'' was released.

For reference, [[ZUN]] was only 19 years old when he sold this game. He's now {{age|1977|3|18}}.

{{thtitle|Touhou |Shinkirou|ruby=Heart Elegant Tower| ~ Hopeless Masquerade|jp=東方心綺楼&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|ja|楼}} lit. ''tower'' can also refer to a [[wikipedia:yagura|yagura]] {{lang|ja|櫓}}, which can mean a ''tall building'' but also a bandstand tower or ''dancing stage'' used for [[wikipedia:Bon Festivals|Bon Festivals]].&lt;/ref&gt;　～ Hopeless Masquerade}} is the 13.5th installment of the Touhou series and takes place somewhere between ''[[Ten Desires]]'' and ''[[Double Dealing Character]]'', and is another collaboration with [[Twilight Frontier]].

==Gameplay==
{{Main|/Gameplay|l1=Gameplay|/Spell Cards|l2=Spell Cards}}
''Hopeless Masquerade'' is a one-on-one aerial fighter with no ground combat. Characters fight one another by using standard attacks (melee and special attacks), skills, and spell cards. Each character features a unique fighting style. Spell cards, skill cards, and items are "declared" by inputting a particular button combination. Certain skills will behave differently depending on what direction you map it to - for example, [[Ichirin Kumoi]]'s laser attack will angle upwards or downwards if the skill is set to an up slot or a down slot, respectively. Each skill, spell, and item adds a single "point" to one of the three faiths, [[Shinto]] ({{lang|ja|神}}), [[Taoism]] ({{lang|ja|道}}) or [[Buddhism]] ({{lang|ja|仏}}). If one's faith gathers a total of 4 "points", the character's bullets will behave differently:
*Shinto specializes in shooting range. It features more bullets with better homing and attack area, but the bullets can be easily destroyed by other bullets or grazing.
*Taoism specializes in shooting speed. Its bullets are faster, have better penetration, and are harder to be grazed, but they are smaller and have less spread.
*Buddhism specializes in close combat. Its bullets are larger, and stun opponents for longer, but have worse range.

The game also introduces the "popularity system". Each character in combat has a popularity meter shown in the corner of the screen, with a percentage underneath the health bars. While fighting, certain attacks and spells will raise the attacker's popularity, while being hit may decrease it. One may initiate a Last Word by getting up to 100% popularity and inputting a specific button combination. In addition, each character has a stun meter similar to the one seen in ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]'' and ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]''. Each character has a different amount, and it allows them to use stronger skills and spell cards. Each character also has an extra, unique mechanic, represented by an icon next to their stun meter, which gives the character certain advantages.

==Concept==
The game features a different style of two-dimensional sprites compared to earlier versus fighting games within the series. It is also the first game in the official series to have a native resolution of 1280×720. According to Twilight Frontier, the entire game is being built from scratch rather than reusing the engines from the previous fighting games.&lt;ref name="tasofro_blog"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tasofro.net/cgi-bin/tasoblo/tasoblo.cgi?no=60|title='東方心綺楼'}}&lt;/ref&gt; The character's portraits were done by [[alphes]]. As is popular for fighting games in recent years, stages use fully 3 dimensional backgrounds. As of the web trial release, the game also includes netplay.

The English title of the game refers to the in-game plot in which the [[human]]s of Gensokyo have descended into a state of hopelessness, while the "masquerade" refers to the final boss of the game, [[Hata no Kokoro]], being a youkai of masks. Her given name "Kokoro" also refers to the Japanese part of the title, which includes the kanji {{nihongo|心|kokoro}}, meaning heart.

==Story==
===Setting===
The game's prologue says the [[Human Village]] is the main focus of the game, and is included as a selectable stage. Besides that, several other locations are playable as a stage. These include the [[Hakurei Shrine]] and the [[Palanquin Ship]]. On a particular unusual note, both the ship and [[Myouren Temple]] are both selectable despite one becoming the other after ''[[Undefined Fantastic Object]]''.

===Characters===
{{Main|/Characters|l1=Characters}}
The game features the following returning playable characters: [[Marisa Kirisame]], [[Reimu Hakurei]], [[Ichirin Kumoi]], [[Byakuren Hijiri]], [[Mononobe no Futo]], [[Toyosatomimi no Miko]], [[Nitori Kawashiro]], [[Koishi Komeiji]], and [[Mamizou Futatsuiwa]]. [[Hata no Kokoro]] is a new character and the final boss of the game. Besides that, many other characters from previous works are featured as background characters.

===Plot===
{{Main|/Story|l1=Story|/Translation|l2=Translation|/Stages|l3=Stages}}
[[File:HM Intro sequence.jpg|thumb|700px|center|Intro sequence, featuring several familiar faces]]
In the wake of so many incidents beyond their control, the [[Human Village]] has fallen into a state of hopeless pessimism. Believing that religion can restore order, some of [[Gensokyo]]'s most prominent adherents of [[Buddhism]], [[Taoism]] and [[Shinto]] all want to take this chance to expand their particular faith's influence.

==Music==
{{Main|/Music|l1=Music}}
The game holds a total of nineteen tracks, mainly consisting of character themes; all are included on the [[Hopeless Masquerade OST|official OST]]. Most themes of the returning characters are arranged by [[U2 Akiyama]]. [[ZUN]] made two tracks for the game; one is [[/Music#Mamizou Futatsuiwa's theme|"Futatsuiwa from Gensokyo"]], being an arrangement of [[Ten_Desires/Music#Extra Stage Boss - Mamizou Futatsuiwa's theme|"Futatsuiwa from Sado"]] from ''[[Ten Desires]]'' and the other is [[Hata no Kokoro]]'s theme [[/Music#Hata no Kokoro's theme / Human Village at night|"The Lost Emotion"]]. The song that plays during the intro is based off of [[Theme of Eastern Story|"Theme of Eastern Story"]], elements of which are also present in the post-battle theme and character select theme. Some tracks incorporate live-recorded instruments, including violin, cello, guitar, flute and clarinet.

==Press==
On October 5, 2012, the main page of the game was released to public by [[Twilight Frontier]]. It includes the main logo, a short introduction to the story, and development screenshots of [[Reimu Hakurei]] and [[Marisa Kirisame]]. Later on, [[ZUN]] tweeted about the project on his Twitter. &lt;ref name="zun_tweet"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/korindo/status/254152336258265089|author=[[ZUN]]|title=''Hopeless Masquerade'' confirmed|quote=企画から発表までずいぶんと時間がかかりましたが、構想何年みたいな感じと異なりちゃんと開発していたのできっと完成します。東方Project第13.5弾 http://www.tasofro.net/touhou135/}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also mentioned in the October 10th, 2012 episode of [[Nikenme Radio]] that [[Twilight Frontier]] will release the game at [[Comiket 83]]. No further details were added, though. A month later, on November 3, 2012, a [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbFyYb6y9PU trailer] depicting a match between [[Reimu Hakurei]] and [[Marisa Kirisame]] was released onto [[wikipedia:YouTube|YouTube]]. The description mentions that the Comiket 83 release would be a demo. Twilight Frontier announced on its [[Twilight Frontier's Blog Posts/2012-12-19 0220|blog]] on December 19th, 2012, that the C83 release has gone gold. A [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DUjUPzIfBk second gameplay video] was put on YouTube on December 20th, 2012. It featured an intro with illustrated battles featuring a few characters, and another fight between Reimu and Marisa with various characters as audience.

A free trial was released on the Internet on April 12, 2013, which re-balanced the three existing characters, added a third stage, and introduced the netplay feature. A revision to this trial was released on May 3, 2013, which was mostly for fixing bugs and updating it to the same engine as the final version.

From May 17 to 21, one playable character was revealed on the official site each day. Patch 1.20 made [[Hata no Kokoro]] fully playable and also added several new music to the game. In patch 1.30 new Spell cards and Skills cards were added to every character with the exception of Hata no Kokoro; new win poses as well as guard poses while recharging energy.

{{thtitle|Touhou |Suimusou|ruby=Gathering Reverie&lt;ref&gt;Double meaning in the title: "萃夢" (''suimu'', "gathering dream") is a homophone of "酔夢" (''suimu'', "drunken dream")&lt;/ref&gt;| ~ Immaterial and Missing Power|jp=東方萃夢想　～ Immaterial and Missing Power}} is the 7.5th installment of ''[[Touhou Project]]'' directed and written by [[ZUN]] and developed by [[Twilight Frontier]]. It is called "7.5" because the events chronologically take place between ''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]'' (TH07) and ''[[Imperishable Night]]'' (TH08). It was developed alongside ''Imperishable Night'' and released at the following Comiket 67.

==Gameplay==
{{Main|/Gameplay|l1=Gameplay|/Spell Cards|l2=Spell Cards}}
''Immaterial and Missing Power'' differs from the other games in the ''[[Touhou Project]]''. Instead of being one of the series' traditional [[shoot 'em up]] games, it is a 2D fighting game with a heavy bias toward projectiles. Because of this slant, the [[spell card]] feature from the series' other installments also plays a role in this one. In addition to being a player's means of using special attacks, after getting opponents down to a certain amount of HP in Story Mode, they will unleash a spell card, which involves trickier attack patterns and must be overcome to defeat them for good. As the story goes on, enemies will have multiple spell cards.

==Name and Concept==
''Immaterial and Missing Power'' is the first ''[[Touhou Project]]'' game to be numbered with a decimal. Though it was released after ''Imperishable Night'', the events of the game chronologically occur between it and ''Perfect Cherry Blossom'', during the summer of that year.

The game was a collaboration between [[ZUN]]'s [[Team Shanghai Alice]] and [[Twilight Frontier]]. ZUN worked on the scenario, [[Suika Ibuki]]'s character design, the spell cards, and a few pieces of music. He also supervised the rest of the elements of the game, though granting the members of Twilight Frontier an amount of freedom in the process. In addition, he worked on various graphics and some of the programming.&lt;ref name="afterword"&gt;[[Immaterial and Missing Power/Afterword|Immaterial and Missing Power - Afterword]]&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Story==
{{Main|/Story|l1=Story|/Translation|l2=Translation|/Characters|l3=Characters|/Stages|l4=Stages}}
[[Gensokyo]] has settled down after the Spring Snow Incident that occurred in ''Perfect Cherry Blossom''. [[Reimu Hakurei]] and the others are currently having a feast every three days at the [[Hakurei shrine]]. During these feasts, a strange mist appears. The playable character decides to get the cause of the never-ending feast schedule and the mist. This incident was later called the "Night Parade of One Hundred Oni Every Four Days" by [[Aya Shameimaru]] in ''[[Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red]]''.

The perpetrator of the incident is an [[oni]], said to have disappeared from Gensokyo, named [[Suika Ibuki]]. She thought that it was a shame that the flower-viewing season had been cut short due to the very long winter. She spread herself out in the form of a mist all throughout Gensokyo, and "gathered" the hearts of both humans and [[youkai]] to cause them to have a feast every few days.

Because the art of oni extermination has been lost to Gensokyo, the girls could not eliminate her, but the mist disappeared afterwards and feasts started to happen less frequently.

==Music==
{{Main|/Music|l1=Music}}
The music of ''Immaterial and Missing Power'' has a total of 34 tracks included. Generally, there's a theme for the night time of each stage, along with a different theme for the day time of the same stage, which are associated to the character.

It consists generally of arrangements of previous Touhou songs by two composers from [[Twilight Frontier]] named [[NKZ]] and [[U2]], along with including original soundtracks created by themselves. ZUN composed the boss themes ''Demystify Feast'', ''Night Falls ~ Evening Star'' ([[Yukari Yakumo]]'s theme), and ''Onigashima in the Fairyland ~ Missing Power'' ([[Suika Ibuki]]'s theme). He comments that his songs felt somewhat out of place among the other arrangements.&lt;ref name="afterword"/&gt; 

The [[Immaterial and Missing Power OST|soundtrack]] containing all the songs was released at Comiket 68 on August 14, 2005. Yukari's theme was later included in ''[[Changeability of Strange Dream]]'' while ''Demystify Feast'' was included later in ''[[Magical Astronomy]]''. Yukari's theme was arranged in this OST and thus was used as her theme in ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]'' while ''Broken Moon'' was used as Suika's theme in the same game.

==Press==
A very early trial of the game was released on April 18, 2004 at the first [[Reitaisai]] alongside the initial trial of ''Imperishable Night''. Later on at that summer's Comiket, a more full-featured trial was released. Finally, at Comiket 67 on December 30, 2004, the full version saw its release at both the event and in doujin stores. Many patches were released afterwards, culminating in the final v1.11 patch that included [[Hong Meiling]] as a playable character, though without a story mode.

{{thtitle|Touhou |Eiyashou|ruby=Eternal Night Vignette| ~ Imperishable Night|jp=東方永夜抄　～ Imperishable Night}} is the eighth official game in the ''[[Touhou Project]]'' series, and the third to be released for [[Windows]]. It was developed alongside ''[[Immaterial and Missing Power]]''.

==Gameplay==
&lt;!-- Please keep this short. Add any extra information to the IN gameplay article, unless it is very important. --&gt;
{{Main|/Gameplay|l1=Gameplay|/Strategy|l2=Strategy|/Spell Cards|l3=Spell Cards}} 
&lt;!-- consider revising --&gt;

This game features eight playable characters, with four starting preset teams of two and unlockable individual character modes. When playing with the character pairs, one character fires when unfocused, while the other switches in and fires when focused, with a reduction in movement speed. The two shot types can be drastically different. The individual characters, with the exception of Remilia and Youmu, do not change shot types while focusing/unfocusing.

Imperishable Night features Last Spells. For the enemy, a Last Spell is a bonus [[Spell Card]] which the player can challenge without the option to use bombs and without the risk of losing lives. On the player side, Last Spells are secondary "bomb" Spell Cards, which last longer and do much more damage than normal bombs at the expense of two bomb stocks. Player Last Spells can only be used immediately after being hit, with a grace period of less than 1 second.

Additionally, there is a "Time Orb" system which affects the story/score, as well as a gauge which tracks how human/[[youkai]] (normal/focused) you are and determines how you can collect more time orbs.

==Name and Concept==
[[ZUN]] has stated that the entire story was a result of his decision to use a partner system in the game (as was the later ''[[Subterranean Animism]]'').

The atmosphere of the game is one of nighttime, hence the title. Many bright lights in terms of visual effects and bullet patterns were used to accentuate the nighttime backgrounds.

ZUN goes into detail on his inclusion of a Spell Practice mode in this game. He admits that it was a risky move in terms of game design, but that since the main focus of the game is spell cards, he hopes to see it used as a kind of aid for the main game. He does still doubt its worth as an extra element, however.

The English subtitle for the name of the game is straightforward – "imperishable" indicates something that will not decay, or be forgotten. In the Japanese portion of the title, {{lang|ja|永}} means "eternal", while {{lang|ja|夜}} means "night". {{lang|ja|抄}} refers to an excerpt of writing, or a short writing with commentary.

==Story==
{{Main|/Story|l1=Story|/Translation|l2=Translation|/Characters|l3=Characters}}
It's the eve of the [[Wikipedia:Tsukimi|Harvest Moon Festival]] in [[Gensokyo]] when [[youkai]] sense that something is wrong with the moon. It appears that the moon has been replaced by a fake moon. The main characters stop time and head off to find the culprit to try and ensure a full moon for the festival. Their journey leads them into the [[Bamboo Forest of the Lost]] and finally to [[Eientei]], inhabited by beings from the [[Moon]] itself.

==Music==
{{Main|/Music|l1=Music}}
''Imperishable Night'' contains 21 songs. Differing from the past two [[Windows]] games, ''[[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]]'' and ''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]'', it contains two stage 4 boss themes - one for [[Reimu Hakurei]] and the other for [[Marisa Kirisame]], and an extra song for the Spell Card Practice mode-exclusive Last Word spell cards, bringing the total two higher than normal.

[[ZUN]] notes that many of the songs in this game are very fast-paced, as his goal was to impart the impression of a "race against time" to the player. He brings the old [[PC-98]] games' music to mind as similar. As such, the staff roll theme "Eternal Dream ~ Mystical Maple" is in fact an arrangement of "Mystical Maple" from ''[[Phantasmagoria of Dim.Dream]]''.

As with all games in the series, the music from this game is a popular subject for fan-made arrangements and remixes. ZUN himself has released arrangements on his various music CDs. Before the release of ''Imperishable Night'', "Illusionary Night ~ Ghostly Eyes" was already featured on ''[[Ghostly Field Club]]''; "Voyage 1969", "Retribution for the Eternal Night ~ Imperishable Night" and "Eternal Dream ~ Mystical Maple" on ''[[Changeability of Strange Dream]]''; "Flight of the Bamboo Cutter ~ Lunatic Princess", "Reach for the Moon, Immortal Smoke", and "Gensokyo Millennium ~ History of the Moon" on ''[[Retrospective 53 minutes]]''. Various character-specific themes have also been arranged for use in the multiplayer games.

==Press==
The trial version of ''Imperishable Night'', bearing the tag "Plus CD", was released at the first [[Reitaisai|Hakurei Shrine Reitaisai]] on April 18, 2004. A cleaned-up downloadable demo was uploaded to ZUN's main site a month later on May 14. He released a few updates for the demo before releasing the full version at Comiket 66 on August 15, 2004.

The game was updated a few times, up to version 1.00d on September 20, 2004, the final version of the game.

*The game's Japanese name ({{lang|ja|'''永夜'''抄}}), contains the first character in [[Eirin Yagokoro]]'s given name ({{lang|ja|'''永'''琳}}) and the last character in [[Kaguya Houraisan]]'s given name ({{lang|ja|輝'''夜'''}}), following the trend of the mainline games' names referencing final bosses or other important characters. 
*Based on gameplay, it's common for fans to widely consider that the game and the [[boss]]es in ''[[Imperishable Night]]'' are easier than those in other games, especially since you can still complete the game while using continues. This has partially lead to the "Easy modo" meme, originally from [[IOSYS]] [[IOSYS promotional videos#Touhou Tsukitourou|Overdrive]].

{{thtitle|[[Danmaku]] [[Amanojaku]] ~ Impossible Spell Card||||jp=弾幕アマノジャク　～ Impossible Spell Card}} is a [[danmaku]] game and the 14.3rd official installment of the ''[[Touhou Project]]'', featuring [[Seija Kijin]] as the main protagonist. The game was released at [[Reitaisai 11]]. As the title implies, it is a spinoff game consisting mostly of (near-)impossible-to-beat spell cards.

==Gameplay==
{{Main|/Gameplay|l1=Gameplay|/Gameplay/Strategy|l2=Strategy|/Spell Cards|l3=Spell Cards}}
The player controls [[Seija Kijin]], who uses a total of nine different "cheat" items to survive and clear spell cards. Before each card, Seija is equipped with a main item and possibly also a sub-item. The main item grants an activated ability with a limited number of uses while the sub-item grants a passive effect.

The items are:

==Name and Concept==
This is the first official ''Touhou Project'' game that does not bear the kanji {{nihongo|Touhou|東方}} in its title (but not the first work overall as most CD titles also don't use the kanji). The Japanese part of the title starts with {{nihongo|"[[danmaku]]"|弾幕}}, referring to the main theme or genre of the game, while {{nihongo|[[Amanojaku]]|アマノジャク}} refers to the playable character's species: [[Seija Kijin]]. The term "Impossible Spell Card" is describing what the game is about: dodging danmaku that's considered ''impossible'', but are actually possible since there's a trophy that can be achieved if clearing all [[spell card]]s without "cheating".

==Story==
{{Main|/Translation|l1=Translation|/Characters|l2=Characters}}

Following the events of ''[[Double Dealing Character]]'', [[Seija Kijin]] has become a wanted [[amanojaku]] in [[Gensokyo]]. There has been signs saying that whoever captures her wins a reward. Since Seija has become a rebel, youkai have decided to use [[spell card]]s that's considered impossible to dodge, but Seija is determined to not give up and decides to cheat using the said items.

Later on however, the [[tengu]] have taken notice and have written up a newspaper about her mischief, which causes stronger [[youkai]] and [[human]]s to try and capture her. [[Shinmyoumaru Sukuna]] confronts Seija and declares that she ought to return the remainder of the Mallet's magic and that they've lost the war that occurred during ''Double Dealing Character''. Seija, believing that using her cheating magic to conquer [[Gensokyo]], Shinmyoumaru states that they ought to surrender because she has had enough. Since Seija goes against her will, Shinmyoumaru goes against Seija and gets others to capture her.

In the end, it's revealed that Seija has lost all of her allies, but it's nothing to worry about because the [[amanojaku]] can never really make friends anyway. 

In the mini game ''[[Gold Rush]]'' that ZUN created for the Digital Game Expo, the story continues, albeit non-canonically&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.livedoor.jp/tohomemory/archives/41324779.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Aerium/status/533868433490718720&lt;/ref&gt;. Somehow acquiring the ultimate rule-breaking item, the [[Miracle Mallet]] (Real), Seija sets about robbing the [[Hakurei Shrine]] of its assets before the Miracle Mallet's power runs out.

==Music==
{{Main|/Music|l1=Music}}
The soundtrack of ''Impossible Spell Card'' features a total of nine tracks. Four of these were directly taken from previous games, all used during dialogue within a [[spell card]]. The other themes, aside from the title screen, play during any other spell card.

The title screen, like any other, uses the motif from "[[Theme of Eastern Story]]", from the CD ''[[Akyu's Untouched Score vol.5]]''.

==Press==
The game was announced by [[ZUN]] on April 12th, 2014, near the end of the internet broadcast "Chotto Summit ~ The Drinking Party of Indie Game Developers",&lt;ref&gt;http://live.nicovideo.jp/gate/lv174951611&lt;/ref&gt; showcasing the promotional video later uploaded at Youtube.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2XZ1w-vvwI&lt;/ref&gt; A few weeks before the release, ZUN posted some info about the game and it's release on his blog.

The full game was later released at [[Reitaisai 11]] on May 11, 2014.

On November 16, 2014, [[ZUN]] released a mini game called ''[[Danmaku Amanojaku Gold Rush]]'' at Digital Game Expo 2014's "Doujin Shooting Game Caravan" contest, where it was available to be played. It's an extension to ''Impossible Spell Card'', but it's yet to be released to the public.

{{thtitle|Touhou |Kanjuden|ruby=Ultramarine Orb Tale| ~ Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom|jp=東方紺珠伝　～ Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom}}&lt;ref&gt;The {{nihongo|Ultramarine Orb|紺珠|Kanju}} is a gem said to belong to [[wikipedia:Zhang Yue (Tang dynasty)|Zhang Yue]], a prime minister of China's [[wikipedia:Tang dynasty|Tang dynasty]]. When he forgot something, he would hold the gem in his hand, and be able to remember everything.&lt;/ref&gt; is the fifteenth official installment of the ''[[Touhou Project]]''. It was announced by ZUN on his personal blog on April 22, 2015, at 20:57 JST.&lt;ref name=announce&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kourindou.exblog.jp/22976576/|title=東方Project　第15弾です。|author=ZUN|date=April 22, 2015|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt; A playable demo was released in May 10, 2015, at [[Reitaisai|Reitaisai 12]].

==Gameplay==
{{Main|/Gameplay|l1=Gameplay|/Gameplay/Strategy|l2=Strategy|/Spell Cards|l3=Spell Cards}}
There are four playable characters: [[Reimu Hakurei]], [[Marisa Kirisame]], [[Sanae Kochiya]], and [[Reisen Udongein Inaba]]. Before release, ZUN noted big changes to the gameplay, which would be "very different" (though still retaining core shoot 'em up fundamentals). He also made mention of the challenge and difficulty in implementing these changes, especially in time for the demo's release. &lt;ref name=announce/&gt;

''Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom'' allows a selection between game modes: "Legacy Mode", which functions similarly to previous ''[[Touhou Project]]'' titles, and "Pointdevice Mode", a gameplay mode that removes lives and continues from the game but adds chapter checkpoints. When the player is hit in Pointdevice Mode, the game reverts back to the state at the beginning of the current chapter with only a small penalty to power. Additionally, after choosing difficulty and character from the menu, Pointdevice Mode grants the option to resume the previous game session.

Grazing is notably changed from previous titles, slowing the fall of point items so long as the player continues to graze. Prolonged grazing of bullets grants an additional 5 graze points. Graze becomes very important as players may be awarded a life fragment (in Legacy Mode) or a bomb fragment (in Pointdevice Mode) at the end of each chapter depending on how many graze points were earned and how many enemies were defeated.

==Concept==
''Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom'''s PointDevice Mode takes inspiration from games such as ''[[wikipedia:I Wanna Be The Guy|I Wanna Be The Guy]],''&lt;ref&gt;[[Strange Creators of Outer World/Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom interview with ZUN|Strange Creators of the Outer World]]- The Challenge of "Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom"&lt;/ref&gt; where the player can respawn from checkpoints each time the player dies. Since so many games copied ''I Wanna Be The Guy'', they were starting to become a genre of their own, and so ZUN wanted to try out something similar. He also noted that the reason he came up with the concept of the [[Ultramarine Orb Elixir]] was because he wondered why those types of games never gave a reason for as to why the player character was allowed to respawn at the beginning after each death.

==Story==
{{Main|/Story|l1=Story|/Translation|l2=Translation|/Characters|l3=Characters}}
Someone is causing havoc in the [[Lunar Capital]], and evidently, Lunarians have come to purify Gensokyo to make it suitable for them to live there (as they oppose "[[impurity]]"). With the help of the [[Ultramarine Orb Elixir]] (or not), the girls must now set out to stop this invasion and find the perpetrator behind this incident.

==Music==
{{Main|/Music|l1=Music}}

Interestingly, ZUN has been using fewer English subtitles in song names each game, but ''Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom'' is the first game in the series to not have an English subtitle for any song at all.

==Press==
''Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom'' was first announced on ZUN's blog on April 22, 2015. He confirmed playable characters and posted in-development screenshots, along with making vague mention of gameplay and story, the latter of which would remain a secret. Of the gameplay, he noted the difficulty of implementing it in time for the demo release at [[Reitaisai|Reitaisai 12]], which he would work on until then and would be released on CD-R.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Additional Information==
*The game's Japanese name ({{lang|ja|'''紺珠'''伝}}) mentions the Kanju ({{lang|ja|紺珠}}), and one of its characters refers to it being ultramarine in color ({{lang|ja|紺}}). [[Wikipedia:Ultramarine|Ultramarine]] is a blue pigment extracted from [[Wikipedia:Lapis lazuli|lapis lazuli]], possibly referring to [[Hecatia Lapislazuli]]'s surname, following the trend of the mainline games' names referencing their final bosses or other important characters.

{{thtitle|Touhou |Gensoukyou|ruby=Fantasy Land| ~ Lotus Land Story|jp=東方幻想郷　～ Lotus Land Story}} is the fourth game of the ''[[Touhou Project]]'', which was released at Comiket 54 in the summer of 1998. In this game, [[Marisa Kirisame]] returns as a playable character for the second time, and the powerful [[youkai]] [[Yuuka Kazami]] makes her first appearance.

==Gameplay==
{{Main|/Gameplay|l1=Gameplay|/Strategy|l2=Strategy}}
This game features two playable characters to choose from, with two different attack types each. [[Reimu Hakurei]] can pepper a wide area of the screen with weaker attacks, while [[Marisa Kirisame]] relies on her power to compensate for her narrower attack spread. The bombs also exhibit unique behavior and damage amounts depending upon the character chosen.

''Lotus Land Story'' is the first game in the ''[[Touhou Project]]'' to feature bombs that auto-collect items, graze counting, the ability to move more slowly by holding the shift key, and a non-trivial scoring system that involves the collection of special ''dream items'' that boost the player's ultimate scoring potential. The game's scoring system also marks the series' first instance of score bonuses for the elimination of bullets following the defeat of mid-bosses and bosses. Finally, ''Lotus Land Story'' introduces the counter-bomb system, allowing you to avoid a fatal hit by using a bomb at the moment you get hit, which also appears in all later games.

==Concept==
This is the first game to use the word {{nihongo|[[Gensokyo]]|幻想郷}}, although as a game title only and not as the name of the world of ''Touhou Project''. The only time it was mentioned again in another PC-98 game was in [[Mystic Square/Music#Stage 1 Boss - Sara's theme|a music comment for ''Mystic Square'']], likely as a reference to the music of ''Lotus Land Story''.

''Lotus Land Story'' returned to the gameplay style of ''[[Story of Eastern Wonderland]]'', again taking on the format of a stage-based bullet hell game. However, the number of bullets was greatly increased, and a second player character, [[Marisa Kirisame]], was added.

==Story==
{{Main|/Story|l1=Story|/Translation|l2=Translation|/Characters|l3=Characters}}
Following the events of the previous games, youkai soon begin to swarm the [[Hakurei Shrine]], prompting [[Reimu Hakurei]] and [[Marisa Kirisame]] to separately head for a lake in the mountains, which appears to be the source of a tremendous power surge. The two reach the gateway underneath the lake, which teleports them to a strange [[Fantasy World]], in which the mansion [[Mugenkan]] exists, where the mastermind supposedly is.

==Music==
{{Main|/Music|l1=Music}}
The main game included twenty-two tracks, including separate themes for Stage 1 depending on your player character. However, in ''[[Mystic Square]]'''s music room, as well as in ''[[Akyu's Untouched Score vol.1]]'', there were six more tracks listed that [[ZUN]] decided not to use in the game. Also included in Akyu's Untouched Score are slightly different versions of ''Decoration Battle'' and ''Inanimate Dream''.

==Press==
''Lotus Land Story'' was developed during 1998, and saw its official release at [[:Category:Comiket 54|Comiket 54]]. Apparently, ZUN only sold two to three hundred copies of the game. On September 19, 2002, all the five [[PC-98]] games have officially stopped being sold, a little after ''[[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]]'' was released.

The soundtrack was later included in the special music room of ''[[Mystic Square]]'', and then on ''[[Akyu's Untouched Score vol.1]]'', which was released at [[:Category:Reitaisai 3|Reitaisai 3]] on May 21, 2006.

==Additional Information==
*The game's Japanese name ({{lang|ja|'''幻'''想郷}}) contains the character for "fantasy/illusion" ({{lang|ja|幻}}) in the name of [[Mugenkan]] ({{lang|ja|夢'''幻'''館}}), [[Yuuka Kazami]]'s mansion in the game, following the trend of mainline game names referencing their final bosses or other important characters. Also, while tangentially related to the plot, [[Gengetsu]]'s name ({{lang|ja|'''幻'''月}}) also contains the same kanji.

{{thtitle|Touhou |Fuujinroku|ruby=Wind God Chronicles| ~ Mountain of Faith|jp=東方風神録　～ Mountain of Faith}}&lt;ref&gt;An alternative romanization of Fuujinroku is "Hujinroku", which appears in the credits sequence.&lt;/ref&gt; is the tenth official game in the ''[[Touhou Project]]''. It is considered the first game of the "2nd Windows Generation", using a new engine.

==Gameplay==
:{{Main|/Gameplay|l1=Gameplay|/Strategy|l2=Strategy|/Spell Cards|l3=Spell Cards}}

In terms of gameplay, ''Mountain of Faith'' is a kind of "soft reboot". The engine, and much of the game's design and pacing, have been substantially overhauled. Playable characters are reduced to Reimu and Marisa once again, with both conventional weaponry as well as interesting new types. This and the immediate next game, ''[[Subterranean Animism]]'', also feature a much simpler idea of player Spell Cards. While proper Spell Cards would return in ''[[Undefined Fantastic Object]]'', that game still retains much of the design and pacing of these two games, and make a sort of trilogy in the same way that ''[[the Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]]'', ''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]'', and ''[[Imperishable Night]]'' did.

''Mountain of Faith'' features two playable characters, each with three weapon types, but no personalized [[spell card|spell card bombs]]. Collecting power items results in an increase in "option" satellites around the character (for a total of four), which behave differently according to the character and weapon type. Each characters' options also fire bullets, and either shift position or freeze in place in focus-fire mode.

The scoring system is based on the Faith meter, which has a refillable gauge and a numeric value (minimum 50,000). As long as the gauge is not empty, the player's Faith value doesn't decrease, but the gauge slowly depletes unless the player is defeating enemies or collecting point items. Point items also partially refill the gauge, and Faith items increase the Faith value. The Faith value directly affects the point value of point items and spell card bonuses.

==Name and Concept==
[[ZUN]]'s intent behind ''Mountain of Faith'' was to create a game that felt like a breath of fresh air in the Touhou Project's setting while still being familiar to its fans. It marks somewhat of a turning point in the Project's worldbuilding, with gods being as much a part of it as youkai from ''MoF'' onward. As it had the image of a fresh start, the Japanese part of the game's title - {{nihongo|''Touhou Fuujinroku''|東方風神録|}} - is a callback to that of ''[[the Story of Eastern Wonderland]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'s&lt;/nowiki&gt;, which is {{nihongo|''Touhou Fuumaroku''|東方封魔録|}}.&lt;ref name="SCoOW_MoF"&gt;''[[Strange Creators of Outer World]]'': [[Strange Creators of Outer World/Introduction of Previous Works/Mountain of Faith/Mountain of Faith Interview with ZUN|''Mountain of Faith'' Interview with ZUN]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The story in the game is tied up with the [[Wikipedia:Suwa, Nagano|Suwa]] mythology, which ZUN knows well. He used some of his own ideas in the story and let it tell in the game. Though, it is mostly seen in the later part of the game. Not all parts of the later part originate from the actual story and real locations. The [[Moriya Shrine]], for example, is not derived from the Suwa Shrine as it would take too much research for ZUN to create it.

A year before its release, he answered in an interview that he started again from scratch for this game. This is to prevent the game from getting too complex by using the same system over and over again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |year=2007|month=July|title=原作ZUN氏インタビュー|trans_title=Original Interview with Mr. [[ZUN]]|language=Japanese|journal=Magazine|issue=July issue|pages=|publisher=[[ComicREX]]|accessdate=15 February, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Story==
:{{Main|/Story|l1=Story|/Translation|l2=Translation|/Characters|l3=Characters}}
It is autumn in [[Gensokyo]]. A stranger comes to the [[Hakurei Shrine]] and says that the shrine should close for good. [[Reimu Hakurei]] won't let it happen so she or [[Marisa Kirisame]] goes to investigate the situation.

The heroine goes to the [[Youkai Mountain]] where she meets three [[god]]s and eventually [[Nitori Kawashiro]], who says the [[kappa]] are troubled by a new god on the mountain. As she advances further, the heroine meets [[Aya Shameimaru]], who was told to investigate the intruder. Aya is beaten and the heroine moves to the [[Moriya Shrine]]. [[Sanae Kochiya]] says that the new god, later shown to be [[Kanako Yasaka]], is trying to collect faith. After Sanae is defeated, Kanako appears and explains her motives. She eventually makes peace with the kappa and [[tengu]], who, in return, accept Kanako as the new god of the mountain, supplying her with faith.

In the Extra [[stage]], the heroines meet the other god of the Moriya Shrine, [[Suwako Moriya]], who is the shrine's true god. Suwako demands that they play with her in a danmaku battle, just like they've played with Sanae and Kanako.

==Music==
:{{Main|/Music|l1=Music}}
The game soundtrack of ''Mountain of Faith'' features 18 tracks, which all could be heard in the music room. When composing the themes, [[ZUN]] tried to add a Japanese feeling to the themes and he says the songs are particularly nostalgic, just like the game itself. The title screen music is an arranged version of {{nihongo|"Theme of Eastern Story"|テーマ・オブ・イースタンストーリー}} from ''[[Akyu's Untouched Score vol.5]]''.

It is the first time a {{nihongo|"Player's Score"|プレイヤーズスコア}} theme (which shares a motif found in {{lang|ja|神さびた古戦場}}　～ Suwa Foughten Field, Kanako's theme) has been used in the ''[[Touhou Project]]''. ZUN stated that he thought it would be too lonely if it was a silent at those moments, but somehow managed to make it even more lonely. The theme reappeared in ''[[Subterranean Animism]]'', ''[[Undefined Fantastic Object]]'', and an arranged version was used in ''[[Fairy Wars]]'', ''[[Ten Desires]]'' and ''[[Double Dealing Character]]''. This theme, however, cannot be played via the music room.

A few tracks were reused or arranged in later games and CD's. For ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]'', [[Sanae Kochiya]]'s theme {{nihongo|"Faith is for the Transient People"|信仰は儚き人間の為に}} and the Extra stage theme {{nihongo|"Tomorrow Will Be Special, Yesterday Was Not"|明日ハレの日、ケの昨日}} were both arranged by [[U2 Akiyama]] as Sanae's theme and [[Suwako Moriya]]'s theme respectively. The [[Touhou Hisoutensoku OST|original soundtrack]] for ''Touhou Hisoutenoku'' had both tracks. "Tomorrow Will Be Special, Yesterday Was Not" is also featured in ZUN's 5.5 Music Collection album ''[[Unknown Flower, Mesmerizing Journey]]'' in a slightly different version. ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'' had an arrangement of [[Nitori Kawashiro]]'s theme {{nihongo|"Akutagawa Ryuunosuke's "Kappa" ~ Candid Friend"|芥川龍之介の河童　～ Candid Friend}}, again by U2.

[[Aya Shameimaru|Aya]]'s theme {{nihongo|"Youkai Mountain ~ Mysterious Mountain"|妖怪の山　～ Mysterious Mountain}} appeared in ''[[Double Spoiler]]'' as the fifth photo theme and with only a few modifications, and was again re-used in ''[[Impossible Spell Card]]''.

{{thtitle|Touhou |Kaikidan|ruby=Bizarre Romantic Story| ~ Mystic Square|jp=東方怪綺談　～ Mystic Square}} is the fifth game in the ''[[Touhou Project]]'', and is the last game for the Japanese [[PC-98]], released in 1998. It is the first game in which [[Alice Margatroid]] appears and features four selectable characters - [[Reimu Hakurei]], [[Marisa Kirisame]], [[Mima]], and [[Yuuka Kazami]].

==Gameplay==
{{Main|/Gameplay|l1=Gameplay|/Strategy|l2=Strategy}}
''Mystic Square'' allows the player to select from among four unique protagonists, each hailing from one of the 2 prior [[danmaku]] [[shooting game|shooting games]] in the series. Series mainstays [[Reimu Hakurei]] and [[Marisa Kirisame]] are joined by former enemies [[Mima]] and [[Yuuka Kazami]] for a journey reaching to the depths of the Makai. ''Mystic Square'' also marks the first appearance of [[Alice Margatroid]] as an opponent, who later stages a comeback in ''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]''.

Although limited by the PC-98 hardware, ''Mystic Square'' is the most refined of the PC-98 Touhou titles, and features gameplay quite similar to [[Windows]] Touhou games. It employs a variant of ''[[Lotus Land Story]]'''s Dream Bonus system, rewarding the player for taking risks (i.e. collecting point items from the top of the field area). Its rank system, however, is more lenient than ''Lotus Land Story''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s.

==Concept==
The final Touhou [[PC-98]] game developed by [[ZUN]], ''Mystic Square'' followed its predecessor ''[[Lotus Land Story]]'' as a bullet hell-styled game. This iteration adds two more characters to the cast, but eliminates a choice of shot types for any individual character.

As the final PC-98 Touhou game, ''Mystic Square''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s gameplay bears the most resemblance to that of the [[Windows]] games.

===Name===
The game's title is a reference to a [https://web.archive.org/web/20150712205832/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystic_square mystic square], a specific type of magic square, which is an ''n x n'' grid with numbers 1 through n&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; arranged to give the grid special properties; the fact that Sara's theme is called "Magic Square" proves this.

==Story==
{{Main|/Story|l1=Story|/Translation|l2=Translation|/Characters|l3=Characters}}
Following the events of ''[[Lotus Land Story]]'', a massive quantity of demons beings to pour out of a cave, once again buried in the mountains. Seeking the source of this invasion, [[Reimu Hakurei]] and the other playable characters, [[Marisa Kirisame]], [[Mima]], and [[Yuuka Kazami]] must travel to [[Makai]] and journey to the fortress [[Pandemonium]] in order to confront the one behind the problem, [[Shinki]].

==Music==
{{Main|/Music|l1=Music}}
The soundtrack of ''Mystic Square'' includes 23 songs. Unlike previous games, which usually had unused songs revealed in soundtracks or ''Mystic Square''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s own music room afterwards or in Akyu's Untouched Score, this game didn't have any more music made for it.

==Press==
''Mystic Square'' was developed and released in 1998 at [[:Category:Comiket 55|Comiket 55]]. It was the last [[PC-98]] Touhou game, and eventually on September 19, 2002, all the five [[PC-98]] games have officially stopped being sold, a little after ''[[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]]'' was released.

Mystic Square's soundtrack was included on ''[[Akyu's Untouched Score vol.2]]'' at [[:Category:Comiket 71|Comiket 71]] in the winter of 2006.

{{thtitle|Touhou |Youyoumu|ruby=Ghostly Dream&lt;ref&gt;Literally 妖 (spiritual, supernatural, ghostly, etc.), 々 (marker for repeating the previous kanji) 夢 (dream). As ZUN mentions in the [[Perfect_Cherry_Blossom/Story/Demo_Afterword|demo afterword]], the pronunciation ''youyou'' contains a double meaning in reference to a line from a poem by [[wikipedia:Sei_Shōnagon|Sei Shônagon]]-- "as the light gradually (ようよう ''youyou'') creeps over the hills"-- so the title can also be taken to mean "gradually-moving dream".&lt;/ref&gt;| ~ Perfect Cherry Blossom|jp=東方妖々夢　～ Perfect Cherry Blossom}} is a vertical-scrolling shooter, and is the seventh official game in the ''[[Touhou Project]]''.

==Gameplay==
&lt;!-- Please keep this short. Add any extra information to the PCB gameplay article, unless it is very important. --&gt;
{{Main| /Gameplay|l1=Gameplay| /Strategy|l2=Strategy| /Spell Cards|l3=Spell Cards}}

''Perfect Cherry Blossom'' features three playable characters to choose from, and each character has two different sets of skills. [[Reimu Hakurei]] is relatively balanced in all areas. [[Marisa Kirisame]] moves faster, and uses more powerful attacks with less range. [[Sakuya Izayoi]] moves slower, and uses weaker attacks that can hit just about everything on the screen.

A major addition to ''Perfect Cherry Blossom'' is the "Cherry" scoring system. Shooting enemies increases your Cherry Points, bombing or dying decreases your Cherry Points, and reaching 50,000 Cherry Points gives you a temporary shield. Cherry Points eventually lead to a higher Cherry Gauge, which increases the points you receive from Point Items.

Other important changes are the appearance of your character's hitbox while you are focused, the properties of your attacks depending on whether you are focused or unfocused, and a helpful cursor along the bottom margin during a boss battle that shows the location of the boss.

This game is also unique in that it includes a "Phantasm Stage" that can be played only after clearing the Extra Stage. [[ZUN]] stated that the Extra Stage in this game was meant to be an "easy mode" version; perhaps Phantasm Stage was the original Extra Stage during development.&lt;ref name="replies"&gt;[[ZUN's reply to messages on the former Gensou Bulletin Board 3]] ― "In ''Youyoumu'', is Phantasm the Hard version of Extra?" "It is the opposite. As you can see by Ran imitating Yukari's attacks, Extra is the Easy version of it. ^^;"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name and Concept==
Following on the heels of ''[[the Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]]'', ''Perfect Cherry Blossom'' was created with the same goals in mind - high speed danmaku, patterned after somewhat abstract concepts. The theme this time around revolves around the [[Netherworld]], and the extra stages also deal a little bit with the [[Great Hakurei Border]] and the concept of a "spiriting away", though these are not discussed in very much detail, as the dialogue remains very light.

The name "youyoumu" implies some sort of mysterious, ghostly dream. {{lang|ja|妖々}}, taken to mean "ghostly", is possibly referring to the overall theme of the Netherworld and its inhabitants, including [[Youmu Konpaku]] and [[Yuyuko Saigyouji]], the first of which contains the kanji {{lang|ja|妖}} in her name. It can also be a reference to the [[Saigyou Ayakashi]], which also contains the character. "Perfect Cherry Blossom" is referring to Yuyuko's end goal to force the [[Saigyou Ayakashi]] to fully bloom by collecting the essence of springtime. Additionally, the word ''Ghastly'' is misspelled as ''Ghastry'' on the jewel case in what would be the Japanese pronunciation.

==Story==
{{Main|/Story|l1=Story|/Translation|l2=Translation|/Characters|l3=Characters}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Dead bodies are buried under the cherry trees! You have to believe it. Otherwise, you couldn't possibly explain the beauty of the cherry blossoms. I was restless, lately, because I couldn't believe in this beauty. But I have now finally understood: dead bodies are buried under the cherry trees! You have to believe it."&lt;br/&gt;-- [[Wikipedia:Motojirō Kajii|Motojirō Kajii]], opening of "Under the Cherry Trees"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Winter drags on past its expiration date in [[Gensokyo]], eventually prompting the three main characters – Reimu Hakurei, Marisa Kirisame, and Sakuya Izayoi – to investigate the cause. Their travels lead them into the Netherworld, where they discover that certain people are attempting to gather the essence of spring for themselves, for some unknown cause.

==Music==
{{Main|/Music|l1=Music}}
''Perfect Cherry Blossom'' has 20 tracks in total, and is one of the largest soundtracks in the ''[[Touhou Project]]''. ZUN states in the afterword that he wanted to create music that was "intense, emotional, and a little exotic". Rather than adding an oriental spin to otherwise western-sounding tunes, he instead started with an oriental feel as the base and tried to work in a western tone.

ZUN has re-arranged some of the songs on various [[music CDs]], such as ''Eastern Ghostly Dream'' and ''Necro-Fantasy'' on ''[[Ghostly Field Club]]'', ''Doll Judgement'' on ''[[Changeability of Strange Dream]]'', and ''Necrofantasia'' on ''[[Magical Astronomy]]''. The fighting games have also featured various themes for characters originating in this game.

ZUN included an unused track in ''Ghostly Field Club'' titled ''Flower of Past Days ~ Fairy of Flower'', possibly meant for Stage 4. ZUN was originally going to re-arrange [[Yuyuko Saigyouji]]'s theme ''Bloom Nobly, Ink-Black Cherry Blossom ~ Border of Life'' for her theme in ''[[Ten Desires]]'', but since she was only a Stage 1 boss, he ended up creating an original piece: ''Ghost Lead''.

The music remains extremely popular among fans, with many tunes being re-arranged on fan-made CDs.

==Press==
A demo version of ''Perfect Cherry Blossom'' was released on December 30th in 2002, at the 63rd Comiket. The game later had another demo with only the MIDI soundtrack released on the internet on January 26th 2003. The full version was later released at the 64th Comiket, on August 17th 2003, and it first hit shelves of various doujin stores on September 7.

A week after the game's official release, a 1.00a patch was released that fixed various bugs. On October 24, 2003, the final 1.00b patch was released with more bugfixes.

At the first [[Reitaisai]] on April 18, 2004, a score attack event was held where competitors would aim for the highest score on the Phantasm Stage. The stage and dialogue differed slightly from the original, and ZUN composed a new song called ''Spiritual Domination ~ Speed Fox!'' for it. This song would later be included in [[sound sepher]]'s first fan-made arrange album, ''[[Cradle -東方幻樂祀典-]]'', released at the following Comiket.

==Reception==
The characters in ''Perfect Cherry Blossom'' continue to be some of the most popular ones in the [[Touhou Project]].

Its unique Phantasm stage, not present in any other game in the series, particularly appeals to skillful [[danmaku]] fans. The Extra stage was shown on the British review show ''[[Wikipedia:Charlie Brooker's Gameswipe|Gameswipe]]'' as an example of a [[shoot 'em up]]. British comedian and satirist [[Wikipedia:Charlie Brooker|Charlie Brooker]] described the game as "a firework display being sick", and as something "masochistic maniacs actively enjoy dipping into".

{{thtitle|Touhou |Yumejikuu|ruby=Dream Spacetime| ~ The Phantasmagoria of Dim.Dream|jp=東方夢時空　～ The Phantasmagoria of Dim.Dream}} is the third game in the ''[[Touhou Project]]'', which was released for the Japanese [[PC-98]] in 1997. It is a unique game where two players indirectly battle one another by charging and releasing charge attacks and bombs upon the other player. This style of gameplay has also been featured in the ninth Touhou series game, ''[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]''. It is also the first Touhou game to feature joypad support.

==Gameplay==
{{Main|/Gameplay|l1=Gameplay|/Gameplay/Strategy|l2=Strategy|/Spell Cards|l3=Spell Cards}}
This game is a vertical [[danmaku]] [[shooting game]], where two characters engage in danmaku gameplay within individual and separate play areas (aka. [[Wikipedia:Split-screen|split-screen]]). Upon meeting certain conditions, players are able to unleash a variety of character-specific Spell Attacks upon their opponents in an attempt to whittle down their remaining health points.

In Story Mode, the player will face nine opponents, each more capable than the previous. ''Phantasmagoria of Dim.Dream'' also features a Match Play Mode where the player may face off against AI opponents or compete against other players, as well as watch AI vs. AI matches.

==Concept==
At the time of Comiket 52, when ''[[Highly Responsive to Prayers]]'' and ''[[Story of Eastern Wonderland]]'' were first being sold, ZUN stated in the manual of ''Story of Eastern Wonderland'' that the third game was about 48% complete. However, the title for the game at the time was {{nihongo|"Touhou Yumejikan"|東方夢時館||lit. "eastern dream time mansion"}}, and was originally supposed to be a horizontally-scrolling shooting game, similar to ''[[Wikipedia:Gradius (video game)|Gradius]]''. No further mention of this idea is made in the files included with this game, however. Interesting to note, [[Wikipedia:ja:夢幻館|Yumejikan]] was the name of an editorial company that published a manga magazine titled "AppleMystery" (アップルミステリー) in the early 90s. [[Wikipedia:Izumi Takemoto|Izumi Takemoto]] was a prominent member of Yumejikan. Given the other obvious references to Takemoto's works in the game, the name might have very well been yet another nod to Takemoto. Coincidentally, Yumejikan has reformed under the name "Mugenkan" (夢幻館 lit. Dream Mansion) in the 2000s.

ZUN does suggest that people familiar with ''[[wikipedia:Twinkle Star Sprites|Twinkle Star Sprites]]'' would have an easy time getting into ''Phantasmagoria of Dim.Dream'', because the gameplay is very similar (though this game has more bullets).

==Story==
{{Main|/Story|l1=Story|/Translation|l2=Translation|/Characters|l3=Characters}}
While enjoying a quiet morning walk, the local [[shrine maiden]] [[Reimu Hakurei]] stumbles across some curious ruins a short distance from the [[Hakurei Shrine]]'s gateway. As only one person is allowed into the ruins - and will be well-rewarded for doing so - seven characters engage in a big battle.

When the winner enters the ruins, however, they find [[Chiyuri Kitashirakawa]] and [[Yumemi Okazaki]], residents of another world who have come to [[Gensokyo]] in their [[Probability Space Hypervessel]]. Their motives turn out to be less than acceptable for the heroine.

==Music==
{{Main|/Music|l1=Music}}
''Phantasmagoria of Dim.Dream'' originally contained 21 different tracks. Many of them were designed for one of the player characters specifically, due to the nature of the game. It also has the first song dedicated to Reimu, ''Eastern Mystic Love Consultation''. Later on, however, three more unused tracks were revealed and included on ''[[Akyu's Untouched Score vol.4]]''. All three songs were unused because according to [[ZUN]], they didn't fit any character in particular. The music was then compiled into ''Akyu's Untouched Score vol.4'', which was released at [[:Category:Comiket 73|Comiket 73]] at the end of 2007, ten years after the game was first sold.

ZUN also rearranged ''Reincarnation'', Mima's theme, and posted it on his old music page. A version of this arrangement re-recorded with another synthesizer would later be included in his first CD, ''[[Dolls in Pseudo Paradise]]''.

The staff roll theme, "Maple Dream...", was also arranged into "Eternal Dream ~ Mystical Maple" for [[Imperishable Night]], and then into "Mystical Maple ~ Eternal Dream" for [[Changeability of Strange Dream]].

==Press==
The game was under development for most of the latter part of 1997, and was released officially at Comiket 53 on December 29, 1997.

On September 19, 2002, shortly after ''[[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]]'' was released, all five [[PC-98]] games officially stopped being sold.

{{thtitle|Touhou |Kaeizuka|ruby=Flower Reflecting Mound| ~ Phantasmagoria of Flower View|jp=東方花映塚　～ Phantasmagoria of Flower View}} is the ninth official game in the ''[[Touhou Project]]''. It returns to the same two-player split-screen style of ''danmaku'' seen in [[Phantasmagoria of Dim. Dream]], and is the only Windows-era game to use this style of gameplay. ''Phantasmagoria of Flower View'' was released in 2005, at Comiket 68, and was released digitally via Steam in 2022.

==Gameplay==
{{Main|/Gameplay|l1=Gameplay|/Strategy|l2=Strategy|/Netplay|l3=Netplay|/Spell Cards|l4=Spell Cards}}

Phantasmagoria of Flower View is a split-screen vertical-scrolling [[danmaku]] [[shooting game]] where two characters must shoot and dodge bullet patterns while unleashing attacks and character-specific spell cards onto the other player. Similar gameplay is present in an earlier entry, ''[[Phantasmagoria of Dim.Dream]]''. When a player loses all of their hit points, they are defeated.

The game features a Story Mode which pits the player against a nine opponents, with each opponent becoming progressively more skilled. A Versus Mode is also included, consisting of a single match against either an AI or human opponent. The player can also choose to watch two AI opponents face off. Using a [[/Netplay|netplay patch]] enables multiplayer through LAN or over the Internet.

==Concept==
''Phantasmagoria of Flower View'' was designed to be a sequel to ''[[Phantasmagoria of Dim.Dream]]'' in terms of gameplay and, by extension, ''[[wikipedia:Twinkle Star Sprites|Twinkle Star Sprites]]''. Twinkle Star Sprites' gameplay where two players simultaneously engage in shmup gameplay while sending attacks to their opponent was the main inspiration for Phantasmagoria of Dim.Dream's gameplay.

==Story==
{{Main|/Story|l1=Story|/Translation|l2=Translation|/Characters|l3=Characters}}
This game takes place in the mystical land of [[Gensokyo]]. Spring has arrived, but something is wrong. Flowers are blooming and the fairies are becoming active as usual, but the amount of flowers and fairies is unnatural; even non-spring flowers are blooming. Playing as one of 16 characters, the player must must battle their way through 9 stages to reach [[/Translation/Glossary|Muenzuka]] and uncover the truth behind the abnormal spring.

==Music==
{{Main|/Music|l1=Music}}

''Phantasmagoria of Flower View'' features 19 separate music tracks. A number of character-specific themes are reused from previous games. [[Youmu Konpaku]]'s theme, "Eastern Ghostly Dream ~ Ancient Temple", [[Reisen Udongein Inaba]]'s theme, "Lunatic Eyes ~ Invisible Full Moon", and the [[Prismriver Sisters]]' theme, "Phantom Band ~ Phantom Ensemble" have new arranges for this game. In addition, [[Cirno]]'s theme, "Tomboyish Girl in Love" and [[Mystia Lorelei]]'s theme, "Deaf to All but the Song" have arranges under the titles "Adventure of the Lovestruck Tomboy" and "Deaf to All but the Song ~ Flower Mix" respectively. 

"Wind God Girl", a song that was originally released in the ''[[Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red]]'' artbook, was included in this game in a shorter form; [[ZUN]] considered the original cut of the track to be too long for the game. 

"Higan Retour ~ Riverside View" and "White Flag of Usa Shrine" were rearranged for the music CD ''[[Retrospective 53 minutes]]''. "Higan Retour ~ Riverside View" has another arrange in ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]''.

An extended version of [[Eiki Shiki, Yamaxanadu|Eiki Shiki]]'s theme, "Eastern Judgement in the Sixtieth Year ~ Fate of Sixty Years", was featured on the [[Seasonal Dream Vision (CD)|music CD]] released with ''[[Seasonal Dream Vision]]'', and was also rearranged for the ''[[Neo-traditionalism of Japan]]'' music CD.

==Press==
Phantasmagoria of Flower View was originally announced on April 1, 2005. A trial was released at Reitaisai 2 in May 2005, and the web version of the trial was released in June. The full game was released at Comiket 68.

On April 8, 2022, Mediascape announced via Twitter that Phantasmagoria of Flower View was released on Steam on April 25, 2022. The game makes usage of Steam's "Remote Play Together" feature for online multiplayer.

{{thtitle|Touhou| Hisouten |ruby=Scarlet Perception Heaven&lt;ref&gt;A pun, both in appearance and pronunciation, on "Heaven of neither perception nor non-perception" (in JP: 非想非非想天 ''hisou hihisou ten''), one term for the Buddhist realm of Bhavaagra.&lt;/ref&gt;|~ Scarlet Weather Rhapsody|jp=東方緋想天 ～ Scarlet Weather Rhapsody}} is the 10.5th installment of the Touhou franchise and a follow-up to ''[[Immaterial and Missing Power]]'', and is again a collaboration between [[ZUN]] and [[Twilight Frontier]]. It chronologically takes place about 1 year after ''[[Mountain of Faith]]'' and some time before ''[[Subterranean Animism]]''; it was developed and released a few months before the latter.

''Scarlet Weather Rhapsody'' debuted at [[Reitaisai]] 4, with a playable demo available to patrons. Another demo was released at C72, and an updated version was released online on April 29, 2008.  The full version was released at Reitaisai 5 on May 25, 2008.

==Gameplay==
{{Main|/Gameplay|l1=Gameplay|/Spell Cards|l2=Spell Cards}}

Like ''[[Immaterial and Missing Power]]'', this game is a fighting game featuring a variety of ''[[Touhou Project]]'' characters. It appears to be similar in many ways to its predecessor, with many similar sprites and attacks. However, the inclusion of a new weather system that can affect the tides of battle, a 20 card deck system, and the implementation of flight marks a vast difference in gameplay between ''Immaterial and Missing Power'' and its successor.

==Name and Concept==
{{stub|section}}
''Scarlet Weather Rhapsody'' is the second collaboration between [[ZUN]]'s [[Team Shanghai Alice]] and [[Twilight Frontier]]. The events of the game take place after ''[[Mountain of Faith]]''.

==Story==
{{Main|/Story|l1=Story|/Translation|l2=Translation|/Characters|l3=Characters|/Stages|l4=Stages}}
A bizarre phenomenon is occurring in Gensokyo. In the middle of summer, untimely rain and hail fall in the Forest of Magic, snow blankets Hakugyokurou, the Scarlet Devil Mansion is enveloped in a cloudy, dense haze, and the Hakurei Shrine is leveled by a sudden earthquake. Throughout the game, Reimu and the other protagonists set out to investigate the source of the strange occurrences.

[[Tenshi Hinanawi]] is a [[celestial]]. Finding her newfound life in Heaven boring and monotonous, she enviously saw the [[youkai]] of Gensokyo stirring many incidents from above. Wielding the power to control the earth and the divine Sword of Hisou, the jaded celestial decides to instigate a catastrophe of her own.

==Music==
{{main|Scarlet Weather Rhapsody/Music|l1=Music}}
''Scarlet Weather Rhapsody'' has a total of 31 tracks in the game for many events and all the characters. The soundtrack was mostly arranged by [[U2 Akiyama]], and only [[Iku Nagae]]'s, [[Tenshi Hinanawi]]'s and Tenshi's last spell theme were made by [[ZUN]].

The themes in relation to the characters are arrangements from their respective games. Not from their respective games however, both [[Reimu Hakurei]] and [[Marisa Kirisame]]'s themes were arranged from ''[[Lotus Land Story]]'', [[Yukari Yakumo]]'s theme was arranged from ''[[Immaterial and Missing Power]]'' and [[Sakuya Izayoi]] and [[Aya Shameimaru]]'s themes were arranged from ''[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]''. [[Alice Margatroid]] is the only character to have her theme arranged from her stage theme used over her actual boss theme from ''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]''.

The pre-battle themes and location themes all share the same motif from "Eastern Heaven of Scarlet Perception" ({{lang|ja|東方緋想天}}), the staff roll theme. Tenshi's last spell is arranged from her normal theme, "Catastrophe in Bhavaagra ~ Wonderful Heaven" ({{lang|ja|有頂天変　～}} Wonderful Heaven).

The [[SWR OST|soundtrack]] containing all the songs was later released at Comiket 74 on August 16, 2008.

{{nihongo|'''{{lang|ja|東方妖々夢　～}} Perfect Cherry Blossom'''||Touhou Youyoumu|"Bewitching Eastern Dream"}}, known as '''PCB''' in English speaking community, is a vertical-scrolling shooter, and is the seventh official game in the [[Touhou]] series.

==Gameplay==
&lt;!-- Please keep this short. Add any extra information to the PCB gameplay article, unless it is very important. --&gt;
{{Main| /Gameplay|l1=Gameplay| /Strategy|l2=Strategy| /Spell Cards|l3=Spell Cards}}

''Perfect Cherry Blossom'' features three playable characters to choose from with two different [[Spell Card]] types each. [[Reimu Hakurei]] can weave through the smallest gaps with ease, and her attacks deal low to decent damage, depending on which type you use. [[Marisa Kirisame]] relies on her speed and power to compensate for her thin attack area, but wields a considerable amount of power. [[Sakuya Izayoi]] has wider and more versatile attacks than Reimu, but can be hard to control.

A major addition to ''Perfect Cherry Blossom'' is the the "Cherry" scoring system. Almost every part of the game is linked with the "Cherry Meter": shooting enemies increases your Cherry points, bombing or dying decreases your Cherry points, reaching 50,000+ Cherry points gives you a temporary shield. The higher the Cherry Gauge, the more points you receive from Point Items.

Other important changes are the appearance of your character's hitbox while you are focused, the properties of your attacks depending on whether you are focused or unfocused, and a helpful cursor along the bottom margin during a boss battle that shows the location of the boss.

==Name and Concept==
''Perfect Cherry Blossom'', as its title's direct translation ''Bewitching Eastern Dream'' infers, is heavily inspired from Japanese culture. It contains references such as the cherry blossoms, the torii at the beginning of stage 2, and the architecture of the [[Netherworld]]. Other less evident references are present, such as the [[Saigyou Ayakashi]] and the last name of the game's main antagonist, [[Yuyuko Saigyouji]], both which most likely refers to the famous Japanese poet [[Wikipedia:Saigyō Hōshi|Saigyou]], who often sung his desire to die under a cherry tree. References are even present in the game's musical score, [[Youmu Konpaku]]'s theme song ''Hiroari Shoots A Strange Bird ~ Till When?'' is named after a story in which a warrior named Hiroari slays a youkai known as the [[Nue]]. The ''Staff Roll'' song is even based on the Japanese folklore song [[Wikipedia:Sakura (folk song)|Sakura, Sakura]].

== Story==
{{Main|/Story|l1=Story|/Translation|l2=Translation|/Characters|l3=Characters}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Dead bodies are buried under the cherry trees! You have to believe it. Otherwise, you couldn't possibly explain the beauty of the cherry blossoms. I was restless, lately, because I couldn't believe in this beauty. But I have now finally understood: dead bodies are buried under the cherry trees! You have to believe it." -- [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motojir%C5%8D_Kajii Motojirō Kajii], opening of "Under the Cherry Trees"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Music==
{{Main|/Music|l1=Music}}

''Perfect Cherry Blossom'' has 19 tracks excluding the ''Staff Roll'' song, all of them can be heard in the music room from the very first time you open the game.

==Press==
A demo version of ''Perfect Cherry Blossom'' was released on December 30th in 2002, at the 63rd Comiket. The game later had another demo with only the MIDI soundtrack was released on the internet on January 26th 2003, to be later released at the 64th Comiket, on August 17th 2003.

{{thtitle|Touhou |Bunkachou|ruby=Word Flower Album| ~ Shoot the Bullet|jp=東方文花帖　～ Shoot the Bullet}} is a [[danmaku]] vertical-scrolling photography game and the 9.5th official installment of the ''[[Touhou Project]]'', released between ''[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]'' and ''[[Mountain of Faith]]''. It was released as an accompanying game to ''[[Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red]]''. It was also released to [https://store.steampowered.com/app/1420650/Touhou_Bunkachou__Shoot_the_Bullet/ Steam] in the summer of 2021.

==Gameplay==
{{Main|/Gameplay|l1=Gameplay|/Gameplay/Strategy|l2=Strategy|/Spell Cards|l3=Spell Cards}}

''Shoot the Bullet'' is an unconventional danmaku game based around the use of a chargeable bullet-cancelling camera. The player dodges bullets but is unable to directly damage the enemy. Instead, they use [[Aya Shameimaru|Aya]]'s camera to take a varying amount of pictures of the boss. Aya's camera is capable of eliminating all bullets within the viewfinder when a shot is taken, regardless of if the boss is in frame. When the boss is featured in a photo, it is given a score based on several criteria, including the amount and type of bullets captured. The bosses included in this game are returning bosses from games ''[[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]]'' to ''[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]''.

==Name and Concept==
The concept of ''Shoot the Bullet'' existed since ''[[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]]''. [[ZUN]] experimented with the idea previously, but the results didn't satisfy him, shelving the concept. The game required a character that takes photos. Thus, ''[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]'' introduced Aya Shameimaru, a photographing [[tengu]]. While ''Shoot the Bullet'' was in development, ''Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red'' was released. This book contains various interviews which Aya conducts with other characters. The photography game was intended to be a minigame included in the book's accompanying ''[[Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red (CD)|CD]]'', but it was ultimately released on its own.

Originally, ZUN wanted to include new stages via updates. &lt;ref name="ver1.01a"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kourindou.exblog.jp/2429760/|title=東方文花帖ver1.01a|date=January 9, 2006|author=[[ZUN]]|language=ja|accessdate=August 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he later announced that there would not be content updates, as he wanted to move on to newer projects. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kourindou.exblog.jp/4354569/|title=オクトーバーリザレクション|author=[[ZUN]]|date=October 10, 2006|language=ja|accessdate=August 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the March 14, 2010, a sequel to ''Shoot the Bullet'', titled ''[[Double Spoiler]]'', was released. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kourindou.exblog.jp/12243476/|title=東方Project 第12.5弾|author=[[ZUN]]|date=March 3, 2010|language=ja|accessdate=August 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Story==
{{Main|/Translation|l1=Translation}}

[[Aya Shameimaru]] sets out to photograph bosses from previous Touhou games. However, it is never revealed why she takes these photos. At one point it is pointed out that "''No one knows the purpose of the photos, except Aya''", and the only reason she does not shoot the opponents is "''not to be nice, but because she doesn't want her bullets in the picture.''"

==Music==
{{Main|/Music|l1=Music}}

The game soundtrack of ''Shoot the Bullet'' features six tracks: one title/menu screen theme, and five photographing themes. Akin to previous games, the title theme contains the motif heard in "Theme of Eastern Story" from ''[[Akyu's Untouched Score vol.5]]''. The fifth theme, "Wind God Girl" ({{lang|ja|風神少女}}), was also featured on the ''[[Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red (CD)|Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red CD]]'' and in ''[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]''. "Wind God Girl" received an arrangement ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]''. The soundtrack organizes the photo themes in the order that the player will encounter them in the game.

An arrangement of "Retrospective Kyoto" ({{lang|ja|レトロスペクティブ京都}}) is included in the "ZUN's Music Collection" CD ''[[Retrospective 53 minutes]]''. In the following CD, ''[[Magical Astronomy]]'', "Sleepless Night of the Eastern Country" ({{lang|ja|東の国の眠らない夜}}), is featured.

==Press==
ZUN announced ''Shoot the Bullet'' on his blog ''[[Invisible Games and Japanese]]'' on November 13, 2005, alongside some screenshots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kourindou.exblog.jp/1835374/|title=文花帖シュート・ザ・ブリット|language=ja|author=[[ZUN]]|date=November 13, 2005|accessdate=August 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These screenshots were supplemented in later blog posts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kourindou.exblog.jp/1977840/|title=本当に冬コミは早い|language=ja|author=[[ZUN]]|date=November 25, 2005|accessdate=August 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kourindou.exblog.jp/2022807/|title=デザインの真実|language=ja|author=[[ZUN]]|date=November 29, 2005|accessdate=August 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was released at [[:Category:Comiket 69|Comiket 69]] on the December 30, 2005.

{{thtitle|Touhou |Fuumaroku|ruby=Demon-Sealing Record| ~ the Story of Eastern Wonderland|jp=東方封魔録　～ the Story of Eastern Wonderland}}&lt;ref&gt;The game itself doesn't have a solid subtitle, except for the phrase ''The Story of "HUMA" in Eastern Wonderland''. The subtitle "the Story of Eastern Wonderland" was later given to it on [[ZUN]]'s archives site as well as ''[[Akyu's Untouched Score vol.3]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; is the second game in the ''[[Touhou Project]]''. It is also the first game in the [[Danmaku|curtain-fire]] shooting genre, and was released for the [[PC-98]] series of computers in 1997. The game features [[Marisa Kirisame]] and [[Mima]] as enemies.

The resident [[shrine maiden]] [[Reimu Hakurei]] returns from a "training" session in the mountains only to find the [[Hakurei Shrine]] overrun by a legion of [[Ghost (Species)|ghosts]] and [[youkai]]. Excited at the opportunity to test her fledgling abilities, she takes the powerful [[Yin-Yang Orb]]s and hurries off on the back of her turtle [[Genjii]] to seek out the source of the invasion.

==Gameplay==
{{Main|Story of Eastern Wonderland/Gameplay|l1=Gameplay|Story of Eastern Wonderland/Gameplay/Strategy|l2=Strategy}}
''The Story of Eastern Wonderland'' casts the player as the [[Shrine Maiden]] [[Reimu Hakurei]] and offers three distinct attack types to choose from: a wide-range type with weak attack power, a mid-range type with moderate attack power complete with auto-targeting capabilities, and a narrow-range type with high attack power but lowered movement speed. The bombs also exhibit unique behavior depending on the type chosen.

As the first [[danmaku]] [[shooting game]] in the ''[[Touhou Project]]'', ''the Story of Eastern Wonderland'' introduces many features that are now hallmarks of the series as a whole: relatively small [[hit box]]es, [[boss]] [[characters]] who are not much larger than the player character however are highly mobile, a power-up system, variable-worth point items, an unlockable Extra Stage, and a semi-complex scoring system. The game also marks the first appearance of [[Marisa Kirisame]], who would become a major character in the series, appearing as often as [[Reimu Hakurei]] herself.

==Concept==
The game itself was designed to stand alongside ''[[Highly Responsive to Prayers]]'' at [[:Category:Comiket 52|Comiket 52]]. [[ZUN]] boasts that it is a danmaku game with so many varieties of bullets that not even ''[[wikipedia:DoDonPachi|DoDonPachi]]'', a groundbreaking shooting game of the time, would compare. Much of the [[stage]] design was apparently influenced by ''Darius Gaiden'', an entry in a series that ZUN usually cites as one of his main inspirations.

Before the game was released at [[:Category:Comiket 52|Comiket 52]], ZUN was already working on ''[[Phantasmagoria of Dim.Dream]]''.

==Story==
{{Main|Story of Eastern Wonderland/Story|l1=Story|Story of Eastern Wonderland/Translation|l2=Translation|Story of Eastern Wonderland/Characters|l3=Characters}}
The story involves Reimu's investigation of monsters that appeared suddenly at the [[Hakurei Shrine]]. This time around, she takes two [[Yin-Yang Orb]]s, and her turtle servant [[Genjii]] in order to fly. She encounters [[Rika]] with her [[Flower-Tank]] and [[Meira]] who want to fight Reimu for personal reasons. She then travels through the [[World of Fantasies]], which is between [[Gensokyo]] and [[Makai]], and defeats the [[Five Magic Stones]] in order to reach [[Reimaden]], which is where she meets [[Marisa Kirisame]] and re-encounters [[Mima]]. Marisa appears to be the ghost's servant. Mima disappears after suffering a defeat by Reimu's hand, but the monsters and spirits around the shrine don't seem to have gone away.

During the extra stage, Rika attacks once more, this time with her new tank [[Evil Eye Σ]]. After defeating the engineer, Reimu returns to the shrine to find the monsters gone.

==Music==
{{Main|Story of Eastern Wonderland/Music|l1=Music}}
The original game included fifteen tracks, in the format most often seen by later games in the series: a theme for each stage, a theme for each [[boss]], a title screen theme, an ending theme, and a staff roll theme. All were included in the music room in the game, which included the names of the tracks as well, and the name of each track appears in the bottom right whenever it plays in-game; ZUN states that this was influenced by ''Metal Black'', a 1991 horizontally-scrolling shmup by Taito.

This is the only PC-98 game to include two vastly different versions of it's soundtrack, a FM version and a MIDI version, which can be selected in the option menu. The MIDI version, not limited by the very low polyphony of the FM sound boards for the PC-98, includes additional voices, melodies and phrases in many songs. The MIDI soundtrack requires an external sound module for playback, and it was intended  to be played on a Roland SC-88. Recordings of the MIDI versions made using a 100% compatible module can be found [https://www.shrinemaiden.org/forum/index.php/topic,18989.0.html here]. 

In the music room of ''[[Mystic Square]]'', [[ZUN]] includes three unused songs that didn't make it into the final version of the game - "Hakurei Shrine Grounds", "Sunfall" and "Demon-Sealing Finale". The fifteen main tracks and these three unused songs later appear in ''[[Akyu's Untouched Score vol.3]]''. Additionally, three songs had different internal names than those used in-game (noted on the main music page linked above).

==Press==
''the Story of Eastern Wonderland'' was released alongside ''Highly Responsive to Prayers'' at [[:Category:Comiket 52|Comiket 52]]. Since the first game had been complete since sometime in 1995, it is unknown how long ZUN worked on this one for.

''[[Akyu's Untouched Score vol.3]]'' was released later at [[:Category:Comiket 71|Comiket 71]] at the end of 2006, which included all eighteen tracks.

On September 19, 2002, all the five [[PC-98]] games have officially stopped being sold, a little after ''[[the Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]]'' was released.

{{thtitle|Touhou |Chireiden|ruby=Earth Spirit Palace| ~ Subterranean Animism|jp=東方地霊殿　～ Subterranean Animism}} is the eleventh official game in the ''[[Touhou Project]]''. The trial version was released at Reitaisai 5, and the full version debuted at Comiket 74.

==Gameplay==
{{Main|/Gameplay|l1=Gameplay|/Strategy|l2=Strategy|/Spell Cards|l3=Spell Cards}}
''Subterranean Animism'' features two playable characters ([[Reimu Hakurei]] and [[Marisa Kirisame]]), each with three weapon types representing a [[youkai]] assisting them from above ground. Collecting power items adds up to four "option" satellites around the character (or eight for the Marisa/Alice combination), which behave differently according to the character and weapon type. Power can be used to unleash a bomb, each with different behaviors, and some cause special gameplay effects to occur.

The scoring system is based on [[graze|grazing]], coupled with the collection of items dropped by enemies. &lt;!--Overall, the system resembles some of the core elements of ''[[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]]'' fused together with the Tension Bonus System from [[Wikipedia:Shikigami No Shiro II#Tension Bonus System|Shikigami no Shiro]] series.--&gt; As such, the player is urged to actively graze at every possible opportunity in order to increase the point item value. Grazing large amounts of bullets in little time is rewarded by the temporary effect of autocollecting all the freefalling items at their maximum value (identical to the [[point of collection]] effect, but without regard to the character's location on the screen), letting the player concentrate on avoiding bullets.

==Concept==
ZUN has stated that the entire story was a result of his decision to use a partner system in this game, just like ''[[Imperishable Night]]''. The partners for [[Reimu Hakurei]] and [[Marisa Kirisame]] in ''Imperishable Night'' both show up again as the first choice.

A difference from other games is that you can still get good endings when finishing the game on easy mode.  However, the extra stage only gets enabled after a [[Glossary#0-9|1cc]] on normal mode.

==Story==
{{Main|/Story|l1=Story|/Translation|l2=Translation|/Characters|l3=Characters}}
A geyser suddenly erupts out of nowhere. [[Reimu Hakurei]] and [[Marisa Kirisame]] take advantage of this by building a hot spring, even though a series of earth spirits emerge from the geyser. [[Patchouli Knowledge]], sensing danger from the incident, consults with [[Yukari Yakumo]] regarding the matter. Yukari agrees to send Reimu into the [[Underworld]] to investigate with a device that lets them communicate underground.

After passing the [[tsuchigumo]] [[Yamame Kurodani]] and the jealous bridge princess [[Parsee Mizuhashi]], the heroine reaches the [[Former Capital]], a place where the [[oni]] now live. [[Yuugi Hoshiguma]] challenges the heroine on a friendly battle, and then says the heroine should go to the [[Palace of the Earth Spirits]]. Here, the heroine met [[Satori Komeiji]], the owner of both [[Rin Kaenbyou]] (Orin) and [[Utsuho Reiuji]] (Okuu). Rin wanted the heroine to come down and help her stop her friend after Utsuho had become too powerful. Utsuho is eventually stopped by the heroine.

Afterwards, the heroine visits the [[Moriya Shrine]] to talk with [[Kanako Yasaka]] and [[Suwako Moriya]]. The goddesses are not there, but she does meet Satori's sister, [[Koishi Komeiji]], who wanted to go to the [[Moriya Shrine]] to ask the gods to empower her pets. In the end, they have a duel because Koishi wanted to see if the person who defeated her sister was really that strong.

==Music==
{{Main|/Music|l1=Music}}
Just like ''[[Mountain of Faith]]'', ''Subterranean Animism'' had 18 tracks, but only 17 can be heard in the music room. The 18th track, {{nihongo|"Player's Score"|プレイヤーズスコア}}, is copied over from ''Mountain of Faith''.

The title screen is just like any other title screen, an arrangement of {{nihongo|"[[Theme of Eastern Story]]"|テーマ・オブ・イースタンストーリー}} from ''[[Akyu's Untouched Score vol.5]]''. A recurring theme in the earlier stages of the game is that it is "cave-like", with lots of echos.

A couple of songs from this game have been arranged for other games and music CDs. [[Utsuho Reiuji]]'s theme, {{nihongo|"Solar Sect of Mystic Wisdom ~ Nuclear Fusion"|霊知の太陽信仰　～ Nuclear Fusion}} was arranged by [[U2 Akiyama]] for ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]''. {{nihongo|"Hartmann's Youkai Girl"|ハルトマンの妖怪少女}}, [[Koishi Komeiji]]'s theme, was arranged by ZUN for ''[[Trojan Green Asteroid]]'' and was again rearranged in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'' by U2.

==Additional Information==
===Trivia===
*The game's Japanese name ({{lang|ja|東方'''地霊'''殿}}) is the name of the Komeiji sisters' mansion, and contains the character for "ground/earth" ({{lang|ja|地}}) in [[Satori Komeiji|Satori]] and [[Koishi Komeiji]]'s family name ({{lang|ja|古明'''地'''}}) and the one for "spirit" ({{lang|ja|霊}}) in [[Utsuho Reiuji]]'s surname ({{lang|ja|'''霊'''烏路}}), following the trend of the mainline games' names referencing their final bosses or other important characters.
* While you're playing, if you look at the right, you can see [[Reimu Hakurei]] written in yellow and [[Marisa Kirisame]] in green.
* Most of the characters that the protagonist meets think she is talking to herself at first, because the protagonist's partner is not visible.

===False positives on Steam Version===
On June 6, 2020, a [https://steamcommunity.com/app/1100150/discussions/0/2295094308086499292/ post] was made in the [https://steamcommunity.com/app/1100150/discussions/ Subterranean Animism Discussion Board] on Steam about the game containing malware called [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DarkHotel DarkHotel], which was mainly used for Hotel Wi-Fis for phishing and keylogging.

According to [https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/e42c8df5ba2d704fb6bd5c50d9fb35c49ebf3122dab75b19b7ed17b6bc84166d/detection VirusTotal], 30 out of 70 known Anti-Virus/Anti-Malware programs detected the game having the virus. On December 18, 2020, the distribution for the game was [https://steamcommunity.com/app/1100150/allnews/ halted].

On December 23, 2020, Subterranean Animism was available for distribution on Steam again. However, to date, the virus is still detected on the game.

However, this is a false positive, the secure hash algorithm for the steam version of Subterranean Animism is: &gt;e42c8df5ba2d704fb6bd5c50d9fb35c49ebf3122dab75b19b7ed17b6bc84166d due to how steam encrypts files, it encrypted the EXE file in a manner where some of the encrypted strings in the .EXE files resulted in what looked like the Darkhotel trojan.

This is the SHA of the non-steam version: &gt;2978b17f6184d100d249d4311348dd30c5c32ec75c014b667a525b797d3d8813 as you can see, they are different due to the aforementioned steam encryption, and the SHA of the steam and non-steam version have completely different results on virus scans.

A more thorough explanation is below.

{{thtitle|Touhou |Shinreibyou|ruby=Divine Spirit Mausoleum| ~ Ten Desires|jp=東方神霊廟　～ Ten Desires}} is the thirteenth official game of the ''[[Touhou Project]]''. A trial version of the game was released on the web in April, and at [[:Category:Reitaisai 8|Reitaisai 8]] in May of 2011. The full game was released at [[:Category:Comiket 80|Comiket 80]] on August 13, 2011. &lt;ref name="comiket_release"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://twitter.com/#!/korindo/status/95919622527795200|title=Comiket Release|quote=定期的に夏は何が出るのか、神霊廟はいつ完成するのかと聞かれるので言っておきます。そりゃもう夏コミに神霊廟の完成版を出すつもりです、それ以外に何が出るというのかとｗ|author=ZUN|date=26 July 2011|language=ja |accessdate=27 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
{{Main|/Gameplay|l1=Gameplay|/Gameplay/Strategy|l2=Strategy|/Spell Cards|l3=Spell Cards}}

''Ten Desires'' is unusual in that it represents a similar kind of "soft reboot" that ''Mountain of Faith'' did, but has never been recognized as such. While the changes are not as extreme as ''Mountain of Faith'', many of the gameplay and engine traits of ''[[Double Dealing Character]]'' come from this game, not so much ''Undefined Fantastic Object''. In particular, the game's pacing and stage design have been changed significantly, and later games mostly bear this design.

The major additions to the basic danmaku gameplay in Ten Desires include the [[Divine spirit]]s and the Trance gauge. Divine Spirits are released when enemies are killed, bosses are damaged, and at certain scripted events. There are 4 varieties of spirits: blue, gray, purple, and green. Blue spirits increase the value of point items collected at the top of the screen, and most importantly, fill up the trance gauge a little bit. Gray spirits behave like the yellow-outlined point items in ''[[Mountain of Faith]]'', granting the maximum possible amount of points no matter where on the screen they are collected. Gray spirits also fill the trance gauge more than blue spirits do.

Lives and bombs are still gained piece by piece. Purple spirits add 1 life piece and green spirits add 1 bomb piece. Initially, the player requires 8 life pieces to gain an extra life, but this value increases by 2 or 3 for every life gained this way (8, then 10, then 12, then 15, and so on). 8 bomb pieces grants the player an additional bomb, and this amount never changes. Certain enemies drop purple and green spirits, and bosses drop 1 purple spirit and 1 green spirit after every [[spell card]] (with the exception of their final spell card).

The Trance gauge consists of 0 to 3 flames that are built up by collecting blue and gray Divine Spirits. The player begins the game with 1 flame filled, and can collect up to a max stock of 3. The player can enter Trance either by getting hit with at least 1 flame filled, or by manually activating the state when all 3 flames are filled by pressing the '''C''' button. If the player enters Trance by getting hit, they will lose a life after the Trance timer runs out. While in Trance, the player's shot is much stronger, the player is invulnerable, and divine spirits are worth more. After exiting Trance, the Trance meter will be empty.

In Ten Desires, practice mode has a extra gamemode known as Overdrive. Overdrive is a mode that is harder than Lunatic mode by adding more bullets and increasing speed. Overdrive is also certain spell exclusive including in certain spells in bossfights (See ''[[Ten Desires/Spell Cards/Overdrive]]''). This game is the only one that includes such mode. However, it can be seen in the sprite sheet on other newer games.
Unlike the previous games, each stage does not have to be finished in order to unlock it for Practice Mode, only attempted; this has remained this way since.

==Concept==
After the main Touhou theme of [[Shinto]] and the ''[[Undefined Fantastic Object]]'' theme of [[Buddhism]], ''Ten Desires'' focuses on [[Taoism]]. [[ZUN]] personally didn't know anything about Taoism before creating this game, so some of the work went into studying.

Gameplay-wise, ZUN claims that it's somewhere in between ''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]'' and ''[[Undefined Fantastic Object]]'', but he wanted to give the game a different style from previous entries in the series. He also states that he wanted to have dialogue occurring during the final battle, but possibly due to system limitations settled on throw-away lines instead. He did the same thing in ''[[Fairy Wars]]''. ZUN has kept difficulty down this time and simplified the game mechanics in order to suit a wider audience. &lt;ref name="zun_announce"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kourindou.exblog.jp/14332117/|title=東方Project第13弾　東方神霊廟　～ Ten Desires.|language=ja|author=[[ZUN]]|work=Invisible Games and Japanese|date=28 February 2011|publisher=[[Team Shanghai Alice]]|trans-title=Touhou Project no.13: Touhou Shinreibyou ~ Ten Desires|accessdate=19 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ZUN has stated that he wanted this game to bridge the gap between the older games (''[[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]]'', ''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]'', and ''[[Imperishable Night]]'') and the newer games (''[[Mountain of Faith]]'', ''[[Subterranean Animism]]'', and ''[[Undefined Fantastic Object]]''). The events in the game directly link everything in the newer games.

The extra stage, which story-wise is completely separate from the main game, was meant to be a little sequel bonus, as well as give to a feeling that it could be a possible link to the next game. [[Kasen Ibaraki]] and [[Byakuren Hijiri]] were other candidates for the boss. ZUN didn't actually decide what the extra stage was going to be until he decided upon the stage title, "Raise the Flag of Rebellion".

==Story==
{{Main|/Story|l1=Story|/Translation|l2=Translation|/Characters|l3=Characters}}
The Story of ''Ten Desires'' takes place after the events of ''[[Undefined Fantastic Object]]''. [[Divine spirit]]s show up in [[Gensokyo]], and our heroines are sent to investigate. They thought the actual culprit was [[Yuyuko Saigyouji]], but Yuyuko says she does not know much about the events and suggest the heroine to go to the [[Myouren Temple]]. After battling through various stages to the [[Hall of Dreams' Great Mausoleum]] they find that the divine spirits flew here to witness the resurrection of a [[Saint]], [[Toyosatomimi no Miko]].

==Music==
{{Main|/Music|l1=Music}}
A total of 17 tracks are featured in ''Ten Desires'': seven stage and boss themes and one for the title, ending and staff roll. An eighteenth track is the player score theme, which was taken from ''[[Fairy Wars]]''. "Desire Dream" ({{lang|ja|デザイアドリーム}}), the staff roll theme, is a slower and looser version of the stage 4 theme "Desire Drive" ({{lang|ja|デザイアドライブ}}).

Besides these normal versions of the tracks, all the stage and boss themes (except during the battle with [[Toyosatomimi no Miko]]) also have "spirit world" versions. The normal version focuses primarily on the melody and harmony and contains relatively few background voices compared to [[ZUN]]'s previous compositions. Upon entering trance mode, the music switches to the "spirit world" version. It's recorded using a lower sampling rate (22050 Hz), and focuses primarily on the rhythm and accompanying voices. Mixes have been created utilizing both soundtracks, which produces a different sound than when listening to either track on its own.

ZUN has said that his favorite song in the game is [[Mononobe no Futo]]'s theme, with the stage 4 theme coming in second. For [[Mamizou Futatsuiwa]]'s theme, ZUN had to work pretty hard in order to create a song that stood apart from the rest of the game (as the story does). He was happy with how the song turned out, though. He then later created an arrangement of Mamizou's theme for ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]'', renaming it "Futatsuiwa from Gensokyo".

==Press==
The game was announced by ZUN in his blog on 28th February 2011.&lt;ref name="zun_announce" /&gt; ZUN announced the list of playable characters: [[Reimu Hakurei]], [[Marisa Kirisame]], [[Sanae Kochiya]] and [[Youmu Konpaku]], making this the second main-entry Touhou game to feature four playable characters (the other being ''[[Mystic Square]]''), excluding the multiplayer games (''[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]'' and ''[[Phantasmagoria of Dim.Dream]]'').

Due to the cancellation of Reitaisai 8 because of the [[wikipedia:2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|Touhoku earthquake and tsunami]] and subsequent moving of the event to May 8, 2011, the demo release was postponed. The trial version was released for free download on the Internet on April 16, 2011. &lt;ref name="Web trial"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kourindou.exblog.jp/14614181/|title={{lang|ja|東方神霊廟　～}} Ten Desires. {{lang|ja|体験版}}|author=ZUN|date=16 April 2011|language=ja|accessdate=16 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proceeds from those who bought the demo at the postponed event were donated to charity.&lt;ref name="trial_announce"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tateito1.blog48.fc2.com/blog-entry-477.html|title={{lang|ja|どうせ二軒目ラジオたいした事言わないと思ってたら、神霊廟はWEB配布が先だった件について}}|author=Tateito1|date=25 March 2011|language=ja|accessdate=25 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The full game was released August 13, 2011 at [[:Category:Comiket 80|Comiket 80]]. A few days later, two patches were released in quick succession in order to fix bugs and a few small display issues.

ZUN had given an interview in [[Chara☆Mel Febri]] volume 9 which revealed more about the characters, music of the game and ''Ten Desires'' in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ichijinsha.co.jp/febri/2011/11/25/　お詫びと訂正/|title=Vol.09 掲載内容|date=25 November 2011|work=Chara☆Mel Febri vol. 9|publisher=[[Ichijinsha]]|page=44|language=ja|accessdate=19 December 2011|author=[[Chara☆Mel]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{thtitle|Touhou |Gouyoku Ibun|ruby=Strange Tale of Avarice| ~ {{ruby|Suibotsushita Chinshuu Jigoku|Submerged Hell of Sunken Sorrow}}|jp=東方剛欲異聞　～ 水没した沈愁地獄}} is the 17.5th installment of the ''[[Touhou Project]]'', created by [[Team Shanghai Alice]], with [[Twilight Frontier]]'s collaboration.

==Gameplay==
{{Main|/Gameplay|l1=Gameplay|/Spell Cards|l2=Spell Cards}}
The game is described as a "horizontal side-scrolling danmaku water action game" on the official website.

==Concept==

===Name===
''Touhou Gouyoku Ibun'' is the third game to have no English words in its original title, after ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]'' and ''[[Fairy Wars]]''.

その湧き出る黒い水を凶と見るもの、吉と見るもの、 神聖なものと見るもの、邪悪なものと見るもの、 天災と見るもの、経済的暁光だと見るもの、 様々な憶測が飛び交い、一部ではお祭り騒ぎにもなった。&lt;br&gt;

Some saw the gushing water as misfortune, some as good fortune; some saw it as holy, while others as evil; some saw it as a natural disaster, some saw it as a business opportunity, various theories were tossed around. Some even started a festival and made a fuss.&lt;br&gt;
But not long after, an event occurred that put a horrific damper on their buoyant moods. From the springs that they drank from, the beautiful clear streams, the hot springs at rest spots... from every location it possibly could, the black water began to gush out.

==Music==
{{Main|/Music|l1=Music}}

Most of the music in ''Touhou Gouyoku Ibun'' was composed or arranged by [[ziki_7]], who previously arranged a track for the soundtrack of ''[[Urban Legend in Limbo]]''. The remaining two tracks, consisting of both of the final boss themes, were composed by [[ZUN]].

{{thtitle|Touhou |Hisoutensoku|ruby=Un[[wikipedia:Samjna|perceiving]] of Natural Law| ~ {{ruby|Choudokyuu Ginyoru no Nazo o Oe|Chase the Enigma of the Gargantuan Guignol}}|jp=東方非想天則　～ 超弩級ギニョルの謎を追え}} is the 12.3th installment of the ''[[Touhou Project]]'', created by [[Team Shanghai Alice]], with [[Twilight Frontier]]'s collaboration. It's a sequel to ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]'' with five new characters and three story modes, and which can also be linked to its predecessor to act as an expansion pack. Its events occur after those in ''[[Undefined Fantastic Object]]''; it was developed and released alongside that game.

==Gameplay==
{{Main|/Gameplay|l1=Gameplay|/Spell Cards|l2=Spell Cards}}

''Touhou Hisoutensoku'' retains the same spell cards, spirit orbs, and weather present in Scarlet Weather Rhapsody, but also introduces new playable characters, spell cards, and weathers. Many existing spell cards, weathers and graphics from Scarlet Weather Rhapsody have been altered and in addition to the new characters, existing characters all have new spell cards. Additionally, each playable character now has a system card (e.g. healing, weather change, bombs, etc.) associated with her that's usable by any character once unlocked.

==Concept==
''Touhou Hisoutensoku'' is the third fighting game in the ''[[Touhou Project]]'' and like its predecessors, ''[[Immaterial and Missing Power]]'' and ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]'', ''Touhou Hisoutensoku'' is a collaboration between [[ZUN]] and [[Twilight Frontier]]. Due to that collaboration, its art was drawn by [[Alphes]] and the music was composed by [[U2 Akiyama]], both from Twilight Frontier.

''Touhou Hisoutensoku'' introduces four new characters in the game. All four of them have previous appearances in earlier [[danmaku]] games. [[Hong Meiling]] reappears in a fighting game because she first appeared in ''Immaterial and Missing Power'', but had no appearance in ''Scarlet Weather Rhapsody''.

It was stated in different interviews that besides [[Cirno]], other early stage characters like [[Rumia]], [[Wriggle Nightbug]] and [[Nitori Kawashiro]], were originally slated to appear in the game, but were scrapped due to [[Twilight Frontier]] not feeling motivated. Likewise, [[Kaguya Houraisan]] and [[Fujiwara no Mokou]] were also considered as bosses, but they didn't end in the game either.&lt;ref&gt;[[Interview on Nae Radio (September 2009)]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Strange Creators of Outer World/Iruka Unabara x ZUN interview|Strange Creators of Outer World - Interview with Iruka Unabara and ZUN]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.shrinemaiden.org/forum/index.php?topic=18442.0&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, it was still decided to put in mostly weak characters, as they would humorously face off against the very powerful characters featured in ''Immaterial and Missing Power'' (most every mainstream character was featured there). [[Sanae Kochiya]] was added instead of these possibilities, and perhaps made as weak as she is on purpose.

===Name===
''Touhou Hisoutensoku'' is the first game to have no English words in its title (the second overall after ''[[Inaba of the Moon and Inaba of the Earth]]''). "Hisoutensoku" is a reference to its predecessor Hisouten (''Scarlet Weather Rhapsody''), and is also the name of a [[Hisoutensoku|giant doll]] within the game. It also refers to "Hisou-hihisou-ten" ("the sphere of neither perception nor non-perception"), which the title of its predecessor was also based off of.

==Story==
{{Main|/Story|l1=Story|/Translation|l2=Translation|/Characters|l3=Characters|/Stages|l4=Stages}}

A mysterious [[Hisoutensoku|giant]] is seen wandering around [[Gensokyo]]. It can suddenly appear and can just as suddenly vanish seemingly without a trace. Everyone who sees it becomes curious and wonders about the truth behind this strange sight. Sanae Kochiya, [[Cirno]], and Hong Meiling each have their own fears and dreams about the giant, and each sets out in pursuit of this roaming behemoth.

Exploring the [[Forest of Magic]], the [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]], and other locations in Gensokyo, the heroines face many challenges and obstacles in their pursuit of a mystery that's far deeper than it first appears.

==Music==
{{Main|/Music|l1=Music}}

''Touhou Hisoutensoku'' has 18 tracks, plus music imported from Scarlet Weather Rhapsody. Except for two tracks, all the music was composed by [[U2 Akiyama]]. Only the tracks ''Unknown X ~ Unfound Adventure'' ({{lang|ja|アンノウンＸ　～}} Unfound Adventure) and ''X and the Floating Objects in the Sky'' ({{lang|ja|空に浮かぶ物体Ｘ}}), two last boss themes, were composed by ZUN himself.

All of the character themes are arrangements of themes from the previous games. For the reintroduced characters a new theme was composed. For some characters, their theme in ''Touhou Hisoutensoku'' is a stage theme from their previous game. For instance, Hong Meiling and [[Patchouli Knowledge]] their theme in ''Touhou Hisoutensoku'' were both the stage 3 and stage 4 theme of [[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]] respectively. Reimu's theme is from ''[[Seihou Project]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s ''[[Shuusou Gyoku]]'' and Alice's theme is from ''[[Mystic Square]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Extra stage.

After the release of the game, the [[Touhou Hisoutensoku OST|Touhou Hisoutensoku ORIGINAL SOUND TRACK]] ({{lang|ja|核熱造神ヒソウテンソク 東方非想天則}} ORIGINAL SOUND TRACK) was released containing 21 tracks from Touhou Hisoutensoku and comments from [[ZUN]] and [[U2 Akiyama]]. Additionally, U2 Akiyama arranged ''Unknown X ~ Unfound Adventure'' for the CD.

A hidden track not seen in the Music Room of ''Touhou Hisoutensoku'' could be heard when you play as Reimu and are in the third round in a normal fight. When the spell card ''Fantasy Nature'' is unleashed, an arrangement of ''Eastern Mystical Love Consultation'' in the style of Hokuto no Ken (Fist of the North Star) can be heard. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hSWYyi5BjE|title=Video Example|accessdate=August 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{thtitle|Touhou |Kouryuudou|ruby=Rainbow Dragon Cave| ~ Unconnected Marketeers|jp=東方虹龍洞　～ Unconnected Marketeers}} is the eighteenth official installment of the ''[[Touhou Project]]''. It was announced by [[ZUN]] on the ''Touhou Project'' news blog [[Touhou Yomoyama News]], February 2021.&lt;ref name=announce&gt;{{cite web|url=https://touhou-project.news/news/3368/|title={{lang|jp|東方Project 第18弾 東方虹龍洞　〜 Unconnected Marketeers}}|author=ZUN|date=February 27, 2021|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt; A playable demo was released on March 21st the same year, at [[Reitaisai|Reitaisai 18]], with the full version being released on May 4th on Steam, while the retail version was released on May 13th.

==Gameplay==
{{Main|/Gameplay|l1=Gameplay|/Gameplay/Strategy|l2=Strategy|/Spell Cards|l3=Spell Cards|/Ability Cards|l4=Ability Cards|/Achievements|l5=Achievements}}
There are four main characters: [[Reimu Hakurei]], [[Marisa Kirisame]], [[Sakuya Izayoi]] and [[Sanae Kochiya]].

The game features 56 '''ability cards''' that can either be equipped before starting a playthrough (with some exceptions), or bought at a shop menu after each stage. While only a few are initially available to be equipped in advance, others can be unlocked via successive playthroughs.
[[File:TH18Card.png|thumb|left|An example of the Ability Cards]]
There are four subcategories of ability cards:
* '''Active cards''' can be used at will with the C key (and switched between with the D key, if several are equipped at once). Most active cards have cooldowns which prevent them from being reused until enough time has passed.
* '''Equipment cards''' give the player extra options which fire additional shots or erase enemy bullets they come in contact with.
* '''Passive cards''' give the player miscellaneous gameplay perks, such as increased shot or spell power or the ability to gain resources under certain circumstances.
* '''Item cards''' serve to increase the player's money, power, or resources when purchased or collected from enemies that drop them. Item cards cannot be equipped by default.

==Concept==
Production of the game started around the end of 2020. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mildom.com/10922924|title=東方ステーション　#27　東方虹龍洞特集 |trans-title=Touhou Station #27: Touhou Kouryuudou Edition|people=[[ZUN]]|type=Livestream|date=2021-07-17|website=Mildon|access-date=2021-07-17|language=ja|quote=「実際に手を動かしてるのは年末、でもその前からずっとアイデアは練ってるよ」「スケッチとかは書かない。覚えてなかったのは忘れる。小手先のテクニックに凝ってしまう気がする。ずっと頭の中でループさせておく」}}&lt;/ref&gt; This game is described as a poppy, rainbow-colored shooting game with a refreshing atmosphere. With a new feature of Ability cards, the game has a similar style to ''[[Impossible Spell Card]]''.

==Story==
{{Main|/Story|l1=Story|/Translation|l2=Translation|/Characters|l3=Characters}}
The story revolves around the circulation of mysterious cards, which seem to contain the secrets of various humans and youkai.

==Music==
{{Main|/Music|l1=Music}}

==Press==
''Unconnected Marketeers'' was first announced on [[Touhou Yomoyama News]] on February 27, 2021, along with information about the characters and story, and several in-development screenshots. It officially released on May 4th, 2021 on Steam, a departure from its usual physical release at the summer [[Comiket]] event, due to the international COVID-19 crisis.&lt;ref name=comiket-cancelled&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.siliconera.com/comiket-99-postponed-and-pushed-back-to-winter-2021/|title=Comiket 99 Postponed and Pushed Back to Winter 2021|author=Kazuma Hashimoto (SiliconEra)|date=March 8, 2021|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the first ever mainline ''Touhou Project'' game, including the PC-98 games, not to be released at a Comiket event.

{{thtitle|Touhou |Seirensen|ruby=Star Lotus Ship&lt;ref&gt;Double meaning in the title: "Seirensen" is also the pronunciation of "聖輦船" ("Palanquin Ship"), the ship that serves a major role in the game's story.&lt;/ref&gt;| ~ Undefined Fantastic Object|jp=東方星蓮船　～ Undefined Fantastic Object}} is the twelfth official game of the ''[[Touhou Project]]''. A trial version of the game was released at [[Reitaisai]] 6 in March of 2009. The full game was released at [[Comiket]] 76 in August of 2009 and hit stores on September 11, 2009. It was developed and released alongside ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]''.

==Gameplay==
{{Main|/Gameplay|l1=Gameplay|/Gameplay/Strategy|l2=Strategy|/Spell Cards|l3=Spell Cards}}
''Undefined Fantastic Object'' features three playable characters ([[Reimu Hakurei|Reimu]], [[Marisa Kirisame|Marisa]] and [[Sanae Kochiya|Sanae]]), each with two weapon types. Unlike ''[[Mountain of Faith]]'' and ''[[Subterranean Animism]]'', the bomb system from earlier games such as ''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]'' and ''[[Imperishable Night]]'' has been reintroduced.

''Undefined Fantastic Object'''s main gimmick lies in the [[Unidentified Flying Object|colored UFOs]]. Certain enemies will release a UFO upon destruction, which the player can collect to obtain more bombs, life pieces, or point bonuses. Scoring generally involves timing UFO outbreaks well and utilizing point-based UFOs over the others.

==Concept==
Unlike previous games, which have focused mainly on giving the player a [[Shinto]] feeling, ZUN designed this one with [[Buddhism]] in mind from the very start. There are numerous references to [[Bishamonten]] throughout, as can be seen from [[Shou Toramaru]] and [[Nazrin]]'s background stories and [[Ichirin Kumoi]]'s clothing design.&lt;ref name="interview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otIrJdoaITI|title=Interview with Chara☆Mel|accessdate=9 March 2011|author=Chara☆Mel|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from coming from a different religious angle, one of the major points of the game was to pay homage to ''[[Wikipedia:Space Invaders|Space Invaders]]'', one of the first commercially successful shoot 'em up games. [[ZUN]] worked for [[Wikipedia:Taito Corporation|Taito Corporation]], the company whom originally developed the game, until around 2008, making ''Undefined Fantastic Object'' the first ''Touhou'' game ZUN made since his departure from the company, and 2008 also happened to mark the 30th anniversary of Space Invaders. This influence was part of what went into the idea of UFOs being the main gimmick. It is also clearly shown in [[Stage]] 6, where the [[fairy]] [[stage enemies]] move in a back-and-forth pattern very reminiscent of the classic arcade game.&lt;ref name="interview" /&gt;

There are also numerous subtle references to the [[PC-98]] games; for example, the main character travels to [[Makai]] after Stage 4, and one of [[Byakuren Hijiri|Byakuren]]'s spell cards references one of [[Shinki]]'s attacks in both pattern and name. Besides referencing older ''Touhou'' games, a few spell cards also borrow their names from other Taito games such as ''[[Wikipedia:Bubble Symphony|Bubble Symphony]]'' ''[[Wikipedia:Bubble Memories|Bubble Memories]]'', and one which references ''[[Wikipedia:Radiant Silvergun|Radiant Silvergun]]'', a shoot-'em-up developed by [[Wikipedia:Treasure (company)|Treasure]].

==Story==
{{Main|/Story|l1=Story|/Translation|l2=Translation|/Characters|l3=Characters}}
The story of ''Undefined Fantastic Object'' is about a strange flying object that appears in the skies of Gensokyo during the early springtime. The player character will, for whatever reason their shot type description says, launch off into the sky to unravel its mysteries, plunder its treasure, and generally get rid of youkai.

Upon reaching the Stage 4 [[boss]], [[Minamitsu Murasa]], the story begins to unravel. The objective of most of the enemies in the game is to free a human named [[Byakuren Hijiri]] from a sealed sleep of hundreds of years. Interestingly enough, every character besides [[Kogasa Tatara]] has an important role in the plot. Each with their own reasons, the enemies attempt to collect these UFOs - actually fragments of the "floating vault", Tobikura - the player has been collecting, but the player eventually unseals and faces Byakuren herself out of curiosity.

After the events of the main story, it is known that Byakuren and her followers erect a Buddhist temple in [[Gensokyo]]. However, in order to figure out what the UFO objects really were, the player later encounters [[Nue Houjuu]], who reveals that she was the one aiding and obstructing both the player and enemy factions during the main story. The reason the fragments of Tobikura had been scattered was because she had placed [[Seed of Unknown Form|Seeds of Unknown Form]] in them, and the reason they appeared to be UFOs was essentially because nothing else should be floating through the sky like that.

==Music==
{{Main|/Music|l1=Music}}
''Undefined Fantastic Object'' has 17 different tracks in it excluding the ''Player Score'' song, which can all be unlocked in the sound test by hearing them at least once in-game. Of all the different songs, [[ZUN]] specially noted the Stage 1 theme "At the End of Spring" ({{lang|ja|春の湊に}}), the final boss theme "Emotional Skyscraper ~ Cosmic Mind" ({{lang|ja|感情の摩天楼　～}} Cosmic Mind), and the extra stage theme "UFO Romance in the Night Sky" ({{lang|ja|夜空のユーフォーロマンス}}) as particularly important. &lt;ref name="interview" /&gt; The staff roll theme "Returning Home From the Sky ~ Sky Dream" ({{lang|ja|空の帰り道　～}} Sky Dream) is an arranged version of "Emotional Skyscraper ~ Cosmic Mind".

According to ZUN, the stage 1 theme is always the first composed, so he put a lot of time into it in order to extensively test the game system; the introduction of ''At the End of Spring'' happens to include pieces of a song he wrote (and possibly never used) during his time at university. He also claims he sometimes thinks he worked way too hard on ''Emotional Skyscraper ~ Cosmic Mind'', implying it may sound like he's trying to be cool. He says he had a fun time composing ''UFO Romance in the Night Sky'', as well, because by that time the main game has been finished and he could "do something different". &lt;ref name="interview" /&gt;

==Press==
''Undefined Fantastic Object'' was originally announced on February 26, 2009, along with a few in-progress screenshots and a simple explanation of the game's story. &lt;ref name="announce"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kourindou.exblog.jp/9703480/|title=記念すべき東方Project第１２弾　東方星蓮船|author=ZUN|publisher=kourindou.exblog.jp|language=ja|accessdate=9 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A trial was later released at [[Reitaisai 6]] on March 8. A downloadable trial version, containing the finished versions of stages one through three, was released to the public on July 19, prior to the game's final release on August 15 at [[Comiket 76]].

Shortly after the full release, on August 27, a patch was released to fix a scoring [[glitch]] and to slightly change the color of one UFO in order to make the game more accessible to colorblind players. An English-language patch for the full version was released on September 8, 2009 at Gensokyo.org&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gensokyo.org/archives/1032|title=UFO English Patch v1.0 Released!|publisher=gensokyo.org|accessdate=9 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;, three days before the game was released in doujin stores across Japan.

In the February issue (volume 11) of the magazine [[Chara☆Mel]], which has in the past serialized the ''[[Cage in Lunatic Runagate]]'' short stories, there was an interview with [[ZUN]] in the form of an attached DVD. During the interview, ZUN details the ideas and concepts that went into the creation of ''Undefined Fantastic Object'', as well as character design specifics and his thoughts on the music.&lt;ref name="interview" /&gt; 

===Virus on Steam Version===
On June 5, 2020, a post was made in the ''Undefined Fantastic Object'' Discussion Board on Steam about the game containing malware called [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DarkHotel DarkHotel], which was mainly used for Hotel Wi-Fis for phishing and keylogging.&lt;ref&gt;https://steamcommunity.com/app/1100160/discussions/0/2292842508233570396/&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 18, 2020, the distribution for the game was halted, though it later returned on January 21, 2021.&lt;ref&gt;https://steamcommunity.com/app/1100160/allnews/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Additional Information==
*The game's Japanese name ({{lang|ja|'''星蓮'''船}}) contains the character for "lotus" ({{lang|ja|蓮}}) in [[Byakuren Hijiri]]'s given name ({{lang|ja|白'''蓮'''}}) and the character for "star" that makes [[Shou Toramaru]]'s given name ({{lang|ja|星}}). Byakuren's surname, Hijiri ({{lang|ja|聖}}) is formed by one of the radicals in {{lang|ja|星}} and both can be pronounced "sei", following the trend of mainline games' names referencing their final bosses or other important characters.

{{thtitle|Touhou |Shinpiroku|ruby=Deep Secret Record| ~ Urban Legend in Limbo|jp=東方深秘録　～ Urban Legend in Limbo}} is the 14.5th official installment of the ''[[Touhou Project]]'', released on May 10, 2015. A trial version of the game was released on December 29, 2014, showing [[Reimu Hakurei]], [[Marisa Kirisame]] and [[Kasen Ibaraki]] as playable characters. It is the fifth fighting game collaboration between [[Team Shanghai Alice]] and [[Twilight Frontier]].

A PlayStation 4 version was released after a year since its initial release, as part of [[Play, Doujin!]]. The PlayStation 4 version features [[Reisen Udongein Inaba]] as an exclusive character with her own story following the events after [[Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom]]. This marks the first official Touhou game to be released on consoles.

==Gameplay==
{{Main|/Gameplay|l1=Gameplay|/Spell Cards|l2=Spell Cards}}

==Concept==
The game features a similar style and gameplay to the previous fighter ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]''. One exception is the use of [[Moe Harukawa]], artist of ''[[Forbidden Scrollery]]'', as the game's portrait artist. She replaces longtime artist [[alphes]], who previously served as the artist on all of Touhou's fighting games. With this, a recurring theme in the game is using [[wikipedia:Manga|manga]]-style graphics, where each introduction to an opponent shows them drawn in a manga-style way.

===Name===
Before its first announcement with [[Twilight Frontier]], there were only English words in its title. An "[[Wikipedia:Urban legend|urban legend]]" refers to a modern folklore story, usually false, but believed by many regardless. "[[Wikipedia:Limbo|Limbo]]" in [[Wikipedia:Catholic theology|Catholic theology]] is an idea that there exists a separate, less "damning" afterlife in earth for those who died in the friendship of God but still in original sin, or due to a serious matter that the deceased left pending during life, which left to the soul of said person unable to enter the heaven. The concept is controversial and is not an official doctrine of Catholicism. The word itself can also be more generally used to mean up-in-the-air or unfinished, as in the phrase "in limbo."

==Story==
{{Main|/Story|l1=Story|/Translation|l2=Translation|/Characters|l3=Characters|/Stages|l4=Stages}}
Strange rumors are circulating in the [[Human Village]].

''"A dog with a human's face was rummaging in the compost pile."''&lt;br /&gt;
''"Somebody saw an old woman selling humans' feet."''

These pointless rumors have exploded, and driven the children into fear.
Unlike the [[youkai]] whose natural purpose is to attack humans, these rumors are both unsettling and impossible to discern the truth underneath.
Since there were no real victims, the adults have come to think of them as merely children's silly talks.

Of course, the girls are not afraid.
They know these to be the outside world's "[[Urban_Legend|urban legends]]" (made-up stories).

Urban legends have an interesting property.
As the circulating rumors change, the anomalies will change correspondingly.

[[Reimu Hakurei|Reimu]] and company have assumed the rumors that fit them, and treat the anomalies as their playthings.
As long as one can control the rumors without being afraid, the manifested anomalies can be rendered harmless.
More than that, they can be turned into powers of one's own.
The girls thought of controlling the urban legends by themselves as a necessary measure for keeping people from harm.

This had indeed been true. Until one night...

==Music==
{{Main|/Music|l1=Music}}

There is a total of 30 tracks in the game. Unlike the previous fighters that had [[U2 Akiyama]] and [[ZUN]] for the music, this time other composers from different doujin groups come and made an official contribution, mainly to re-arrange characters' themes from previous Touhou games. One notable use of instrument amongst these arrangers is the guitar. To add to this, U2 (with [[JUN]] providing the violin) also provided music, mainly original themes, and ZUN created two new themes; one called "Battlefield of the Flower Threshold" as [[Kasen Ibaraki]]'s theme and "Last Occultism ~ Esotericist of the Present World" as [[Sumireko Usami]]'s. Notably, [[Reimu Hakurei]]'s theme is an arrangement of "Dichromatic Lotus Butterfly ~ Red and White" from ''[[Dolls in Pseudo Paradise]]'', itself coming from ''[[Shuusou Gyoku]]''. 

Unlike other fighters as well, the main scenarios don't use character themes; instead, there are new themes that are fixed specifically for these scenarios (listed under "Story Mode Battle Theme" in the link).

The [[ULiL OST|Music album]] containing all the songs was later released at Comiket 88 on August 14, 2015.

Later on the [[ULiL OST 2|2nd Music album]] was released on December 8, 2016. It is a follow-up to the [[Urban Legend in Limbo OST]], released as a bonus CD with the first pressing edition of the PlayStation 4 version of the game.
==Press==
The game was announced by [[ZUN]] on November 16th, 2014, at Digital Game Expo 2014 alongside ''[[Danmaku Amanojaku Gold Rush]]''. Cards were handed out featuring [[Marisa Kirisame]] on a cover with references to Japanese urban myths in the background with art by [[Moe Harukawa]], along with the text "Get your hands on the Occult Ball!"

On December 22nd, 2014, ZUN [https://twitter.com/korindo/status/547263752240787456 tweeted] the proper announcement of the game, and linked to [[Twilight Frontier]]'s new [http://www.tasofro.net/touhou145/index.html website] for Touhou 14.5, thus also announcing the newest [[Team Shanghai Alice]] and Tasofro collaboration.

A trial version was released on December 29, 2014 during the [[Comiket 87]].

On April 11th, 2015, Tasofro announced that the game will be released on May 10th, 2015, at [[Reitaisai 12]], and revealed [[Fujiwara no Mokou]] and [[Shinmyoumaru Sukuna]] as playable characters.

On February 6, 2016 during the Nikenme Radio stream, ZUN, alongside with Unabara Iruka, confirmed a PlayStation 4 release of the game with additional content.

On May 9, 2016, a trailer for the PlayStation 4 version is released with the confirmation of the new returning character, [[Reisen Udongein Inaba]], with her story being said to continue after the events of Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom.

On September 2, 2016, more information about the PlayStation 4 port was given. It is revealed that Reisen's theme is to be remixed by BeatMARIO. A release date of December 8, 2016 is confirmed for Japan and first print copies will include a new soundtrack for the game. HORI announced alongside the release of Urban Legend in Limbo themed Real Arcade PRO arcade sticks with the Reimu themed version being exclusively available in Amazon Japan while the Marisa themed version will be exclusive in HORI's online store at the price of ¥16,980 each.

{{thtitle||Hifuu|ruby=Secret Sealing| Nightmare Diary ~ Violet Detector |jp=秘封ナイトメアダイアリー　〜 Violet Detector}}  is a [[danmaku]] vertical-scrolling photography game and the "16.5th" official installment of the ''[[Touhou Project]]'', featuring [[Sumireko Usami]] as the playable character and main protagonist. The game is a follow-up to ''[[Double Spoiler]]'' and ''[[Shoot the Bullet]]'', which are similar in both gameplay and concept. It was released on August 10, 2018, at [[Comiket 94]].

==Gameplay==
{{Main|/Gameplay|l1=Gameplay|Violet Detector/Gameplay/Strategy|l2=Strategy|/Spell Cards|l3=Spell Cards}}
''Violet Detector'', like its predecessors ''Shoot the Bullet'', ''Double Spoiler'' and ''Impossible Spell Card'', is a collection of many individual danmaku patterns that the player can choose from at their leisure. In addition to the usual mechanic of taking photographs that clear enemy bullets, Sumireko has several psychic superpowers at her disposal, such as teleportation. The game features all of the characters who debuted in ''[[Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom]]'' and ''[[Hidden Star in Four Seasons]]'', plus Reimu, Marisa, and most of the final and EX bosses from previous games.

==Name and Concept==
{{Stub|section}}

==Story==
{{Main|/Translation|l1=Translation|/Characters|l2=Characters}}
[[Sumireko Usami]], psychic teenager and frequent visitor to Gensokyo, finds herself trapped in a nightmare wherein Gensokyo's residents are relentlessly attacking her with danmaku. A frustrated Sumireko decides to make the best of the situation by photographing the danmaku patterns to share on social media, and after doing so, finds that she's been freed from the dream. Three long weeks of danmaku nightmares follow...

==Music==
{{Main|/Music|l1=Music}}
The soundtrack of ''Violet Detector'' features a total of eight tracks. Four of these are taken from previous games or music albums, and are all used during dialogue within a given scene. The other themes, aside from the title screen, play during any other scene.

==Press==
[[ZUN]] announced the game on [https://kourindou.exblog.jp/27419239 his blog] and [https://twitter.com/korindo/status/1019839836448931840 Twitter account] on July 19, 2018.

{{thtitle|Touhou |Kikeijuu|ruby=[[Oni]]-Shaped Beast| ~ Wily Beast and Weakest Creature|jp=東方鬼形獣　～ Wily Beast and Weakest Creature}} is the seventeenth official installment of the ''[[Touhou Project]]''. It was announced by ZUN on his personal blog on April 17, 2019, at 14:02 JST.&lt;ref name=announce&gt;{{cite web|url=https://kourindou.exblog.jp/28205045/|title={{lang|ja|東方Project 第17弾です}}|author=ZUN|date=April 17, 2019|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt; A playable demo was released on May 5, 2019, at [[Reitaisai|Reitaisai 16]]. The full version was released August 12, 2019, at [[Comiket|Comiket 96]]. 

==Gameplay==
{{Main|/Gameplay|l1=Gameplay|/Gameplay/Strategy|l2=Strategy|/Spell Cards|l3=Spell Cards|/Achievements|l4=Achievements}}
There are three main characters: [[Reimu Hakurei]], [[Marisa Kirisame]], and [[Youmu Konpaku]]. The player can equip one of three animal spirits, namely "Wolf", "Otter" and "Eagle". "Wolf" powers up the player's focused shot, "Otter" powers up the player's bombs, and "Eagle" powers up the player's unfocused shot.&lt;ref name=announce /&gt;

Upon defeating certain enemies and in-between each Spell Card, items called '''Spirit Items''' will appear on screen and bounce around for a very long time, similar to [[Undefined Fantastic Object]]'s UFOs. &lt;br&gt;There are three ''Beast Spirits'' items (one for ''Wolf'', ''Otter'' and ''Eagle'') which periodically cycle in the aforementioned order. 

Upon collecting five ''Spirit Items'', the player enters '''Roaring Mode'''. Similarly to [[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]'s Supernatural Border mode, ''Roaring Mode'' can end by timeout, calling off or by being hit, which negates the hit. While ending ''Roaring Mode'' by timeout creates new ''Beast Items'', ending it through any other method triggers a ''Spirit Strike'' which deletes nearby bullets. All standard non-basic drops (lives, bombs, high-value power &amp; high-value points) now also feed into this system.

Triggering ''Roaring Mode'' with three or more of the same ''Beast Spirits'' will give the player special bonuses. 
* For three or more ''Wolf Spirits'', the player's focused shot will be improved (and shot even whilst unfocused). 
* For three or more ''Otter Spirits'', the player will receive an orbiting bullet shield. 
* For three of more ''Eagle Spirits'', the player's unfocused shot will be improved (and shot even whilst focused). 
Triggering such a '''Berserk Roaring Mode''' which matches your Shot Type and/or with more than three ''Beast Items'' will elongate its duration.

This game sees the return of Spell Practice and marks the addition of "Achievements" to the mainline franchise. These reward completing each scenario, difficulty, 1ccs and no-miss runs. &lt;br&gt;There are also secret achievements to be found.

==Concept==
In the game's preliminary description, ZUN describes it as "a shooting game that's darker than usual, full of animal elements, and just a bit aggressive."&lt;ref name=announce /&gt;

==Story==
{{Main|/Story|l1=Story|/Translation|l2=Translation|/Characters|l3=Characters}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Beast spirits began to invade from Hell en masse.''

''"They're trying to take over the surface world with brute force and sheer numbers.''&lt;br&gt;
''I beg of you! Venture into Hell with me, and put a stop to their plans!"''
''So she was told, by a beast spirit that was cooperative with humans...''&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Reimu, Marisa and Youmu encounter several animal spirits from [[Hell]], who claim that their fellow animal spirits are plotting to take over the surface world. The three heroines team up with the spirits, and venture into Hell to take out this new potential threat.

==Music==
{{Main|/Music|l1=Music}}
Wily Beast and Weakest Creature has 17 different tracks in it excluding the Player Score song, which can all be unlocked in the sound test by hearing them at least once in-game. The Stage 6 theme "Electric Heritage" is an arranged version of "Entrust the World to Idols ~ Idolatrize World", and the staff roll theme "Returning Home from the Underground" is, as is stated in the comment, an arranged version of the Stage 4 theme "Unlocated Hell". Several songs from this soundtrack aim to "''portray a Touhou-esque view''" of the afterlife, as seen in the description of "The Lamentations Known Only by Jizo" and "Everlasting Red Spider Lily".

ZUN sees "The Lamentations Known Only by Jizo" as the first instance of a Stage 1 theme being not "''bright''" and "''cheery''", but rather feeling more melancholy. "Unlocated Hell" marks another self-admitted failure of an attempt at heavy metal (see [[Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil/Music|Sakuya's theme]]). Many of the later songs do include the now classic ZUN-electric guitar. On the note of "electric", "Electric Heritage" is one of the first songs of the Touhou Project to have a distinct "cyber" feeling. 

In the description of "The Shining Law of the Strong Eating the Weak", ZUN notes that he'd like to start "refining his [musical] sensibility" with his children in later games.

==Press==
''Wily Beast and Weakest Creature'' was first announced on ZUN's blog on April 17, 2019, along with information about the characters and story, and several in-development screenshots. 

He noted that the game would be "darker than usual" and even "a bit aggressive"&lt;ref name=announce /&gt;. The trial CD was released on May 5th, 2019, during Reitaisai 16&lt;ref name=trial&gt;{{cite web|url=https://kourindou.exblog.jp/28279622/|title={{lang|ja|明日は例大祭です}}|author=ZUN|date=May 4, 2019|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt;. On May 20th, he announced the trial of ''Wily Beast and Weakest Creature'' would also be available on Steam&lt;ref name=steamtrial&gt;{{cite web|url=https://kourindou.exblog.jp/28323776/|title={{lang|ja|東方鬼形獣の体験版を公開しました}}|author=ZUN|date=May 20, 2019|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which is, according to Team Shanghai Alice's legal representative Fumio Oyamada, the result of a conversation with Toby Fox.&lt;ref name=stationstream&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFEbWqs_Hh4&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=6396|title={{lang|ja|東方ステーション #18　～例大祭特集～}}|author=ステーション東方|date=May 10, 2019|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game was released on August 12th, 2019, during Comiket 96, along with a bug patch&lt;ref name=release&gt;{{cite web|url=https://kourindou.exblog.jp/28512725/|title={{lang|ja|夏コミ情報と重要なお知らせ }}|author=ZUN|date=August 10, 2019|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The Steam version of the full release was available September 10th, 2019.&lt;ref name=steam&gt;{{cite web|url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1079160/__Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature/|title={{lang|en|東方鬼形獣 〜 Wily Beast and Weakest Creature. on Steam}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the afterword, ZUN sees ''Wily Beast and Weakest Creature'' as possibly the easiest game in the series.
