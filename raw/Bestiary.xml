      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1057">{{nihongo|'''Amanojaku'''|天邪鬼}} are [[oni]]-like creatures from the Japanese folklore. Amanojaku aren't oni, but just a particularly twisted type of youkai who is able to provoke a person and instigate him to do evil deeds. They're the spirits of contradiction and perversity.

==Amanojaku in Touhou Project==
Amanojaku like [[Seija Kijin]] are said to think and act contrarily. It is unknown if this is a trait to all amanojaku, but Seija will like what others hate, and if she makes someone happy, she will be sad, and so on. This causes her to be disliked, but of course, being disliked only makes her happy. Even when she lost her allies as a result of her actions in ''[[Impossible Spell Card]]'', she didn't mind. Her nature is exemplified by her ability to flip anything upside-down.

Anthropologically, angels are depicted to be "pure contingent spirits". They are supposed to be God's paraphernalia and depicted to be the immaterial voice of god. Their role is to support and guide [[human]]s and fulfil God's tasks.

Although many different religions have different beliefs about angels.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6822">Animals ({{lang|ja|動物}}, ''Doubutsu''; {{lang|ja|獣}}, ''Kemono''.) are any organism either classified as an invertebrate or a vertebrate.

While youkai based on animals like [[tengu]] or [[kappa]] would be animals themselves they are not classified as such because they are supernatural rather than logical and scientific. Animals are often considered to be anything that move, however creatures like [[karakasa obake]] and [[ghost]]s are hard to classify as the first is born from an inanimate object while the latter is dead in the form of some kind of energy.

==Types of Animals==
===Invertebrate===
'''Invertebrates''' are animals that lack a backbone. They consist of animals belonging to groups like mollusks, crustaceans, arachnids and insects. This group includes almost all the animal species in the world except for the group known as vertebrates. Invertebrates first appeared around 665 million years ago.

===Fish===
'''Fish''' are the oldest group of vertebrates. While many fish are bound to water some have amphibian like adaptations. Fish consist of animals such as [[oarfish]], [[namazu|catfish]] and carp. Fish are the most diverse vertebrate on Earth. Fish first appeared around 510 million years ago.

===Amphibian===
'''Amphibians''' are a group of vertebrates consisting of animals such as frogs, [[toad]]s and salamanders. Amphibians first appeared around 397 million years ago.

===Reptile===
'''Reptiles''' are a group of vertebrates consisting of animals such as lizards, [[turtle]]s, and the famous dinosaurs. Reptiles first appeared around 320-310 million years ago.

===Mammal===
'''Mammals''' are a group of vertebrates that descend from a branch of reptiles known as synapsids. Mammals range from small creatures such as [[mouse|mice]] to larger creatures such as [[tiger]]s. Among mammals, [[human]]s are among the most successful. Mammals first appeared around 220 million years ago.

===Bird===
'''Birds''' are the youngest group of vertebrates thought to have evolved from a branch of reptiles known as the dinosaurs, [[Wikipedia:Maniraptora|maniraptorans]] in specific. Birds are the most diverse among the terrestrial vertebrates mainly consisting of animals that are capable of flight like the [[crow]]s and [[Sea Eagle|sea eagle]]s, while flightless birds like dodos and penguins are either endangered or simply extinct. Birds first appeared around 160 million years ago. Most recent classifications of birds have become more difficult as some scientist place birds in the ''Reptilia'' class while others place in its' own class ''Aves''.

==Animals in Touhou==
The native fauna of Gensokyo likely mirrors that of Japan. Animals such as the [[oarfish]] (With the exception of youkai variants) are not likely to live in Gensokyo but can be found in the oceans of the [[outside world]]. Aside from regular animals, [[cryptid]]s also live in Gensokyo; aside from being mythological and may possess strange powers, they act just like any animal (In terms of intelligence). It is unknown if cryptids can become youkai [[beast]]s as well.

The more commonly used term doubutsu ({{lang|ja|動物}}) was used by [[Rin Kaenbyou]] in-game to identify animals.&lt;ref name="bou_n_1"&gt;[[Subterranean Animism]]: [[Subterranean Animism/Story/Reimu and Aya's Scenario|Reimu and Aya's Scenario Stage 5]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bou_n_2"&gt;[[Subterranean Animism]]: [[Subterranean Animism/Story/Marisa and Nitori's Scenario|Marisa and Nitori's Scenario Stage 5]]&lt;/ref&gt; Her classification are more accurate than [[Hieda no Akyuu]] who only seems to group mammals as animals, while Rin also includes birds. Many who are native to [[Gensokyo]] use a rather crude form of the word, kemono ({{lang|ja|獣}}) which often defines them as beastly creatures.&lt;ref name="bou_n_3"&gt;[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]: [[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Beast|Beast]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bou_n_4"&gt;[[Oriental Sacred Place]]: [[Oriental Sacred Place#OSP Chapter Sixteen|Chapter 16]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are exceptions like the tofu store who wrote in ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'', and [[Aya Shameimaru]] in ''[[Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red]]'' who used the term doubutsu to identify [[Ran Yakumo]], unlike the other residents who commonly refer to her as a kemono.&lt;ref name="bou_n_5"&gt;[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]: [[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Ran Yakumo|Ran Yakumo]] &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bou_n_6"&gt;[[Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red]]: [[Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red/Yukari|Yukari]] &lt;/ref&gt;

While the latter is used in modern times commonly in popular culture, it is not often used for documents involving species or classifications but both terms are valid. It is often used to describe large animals otherwise known as megafauna that strike fear to the average human.

===Nekomata===
According to Japanese folklore, a cat (neko) that has lived for a long time can become a kind of [[youkai]] called a '''nekomata''' ({{lang|ja|猫叉}}). It was believed that after a cat reached ten years of age, its tail would slowly split into two tails, and, along the way, it would develop magic powers, primarily those of necromancy and shamanism. Nekomata also have an ability to shape shift into a [[human]] form and are generally hostile to humans.

There is also one kind of Nekomata that lived in ''Nabeshimahan'' ({{lang|ja|鍋島藩}}), which lived long enough to split its tail six times, resulting in seven tails. It is the most powerful nekomata in Japan.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1495">{{nihongo|'''Baku'''|獏 or 貘}} are a kind of Japanese [[youkai]] that devour dreams and nightmares. They have a long history in Japanese folklore and art. The Japanese term baku has two current meanings, referring to both the traditional dream-devouring creature and to the zoological tapir. In recent years, there have been changes in how the baku is depicted, and it is sometimes described as a [[chimera]]-like creature, with the body of a bear, an elephant's trunk, rhinoceros eyes, an ox tail, and tiger paws. They are generally considered benevolent creatures, but since they can also eat pleasant dreams besides nightmares, there's a dark side to them.

==Baku in Touhou==
In Touhou, baku are residents and rulers of the world of dreams, and their job is to maintain order in such a world. They are able of creating, changing and eating (erasing) the dreams of every creature at will. Their [[humanoid]] appearance seems to partially follow the original description, as [[Doremy Sweet]], the only known representative of this species, displays an ox tail.

Perhaps because of their abilities, [[Reisen Udongein Inaba]] considers them the most dangerous kind of [[youkai]] in the world of dreams.&lt;ref&gt;[[Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom]] - Reisen Scenario, Stage 3 &lt;/ref&gt;

At this time, no character has been seen or appeared to be a true bat, however some characters are capable of turning into bats. The first appearance of a bat transformation is [[Elis]], [[Flandre]] and [[Remilia Scarlet]] can also turn into bats. [[Kurumi]], on the other hand, is seen with bat wings on her back just like Remilia, but it is unknown if she can fully turn into a bat. Moreover, because of the unknown species of [[Elis]] it is not sure that only vampires can transform into bats as well as the real capacities of such a transformation are unknown.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3465">'''Beast youkai''' ({{lang|ja|妖獣}}, ''Youjuu''; {{lang|ja|魔獣}}, ''Majuu'') are [[animal]]s that have become [[youkai]]. 

==Beast Youkai in Touhou==
'''Beast youkai''' are animals with "too much power and wisdom" (as defined in ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Beast|Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'') and may act as leaders to their non-youkai counterparts or live alongside them. (In the case of [[Tewi Inaba]] or [[Aya Shameimaru]], they are very protective of their kind despite the latter treating them as a tool)&lt;ref&gt;[[Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red]]: [[Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red/Chen|Chen]]&lt;/ref&gt; Some are considered to be a threat to [[human]]s as they may have a taste for human flesh. Youkai variants of humans like [[magician]]s can also pose an average level of threat to regular humans as they steal things from livestock to children. While beast youkai are intelligent enough to communicate with humans, they appear to still be primitive in nature; youkai [[crow]]s like [[tengu]] however, are more advanced compared to the humans of Gensokyo. &lt;ref&gt;[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]: [[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Tengu|Tengu]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hieda no Akyuu]]'s classifications of beast youkai refer only to the mammal youkai. Youkai like [[Wriggle Nightbug]] and [[Mystia Lorelei]] are not seen as such to Akyuu likely because of the older way of thinking that only mammals are animals while humans are not mammals but an unique existence.

According to [[Kasen Ibaraki]] in ''[[Oriental Sacred Place]]'' chapter 16, once an animal has become a youkai, it is unable to return to normal.

;General Characteristics
According to ''Perfect Memento'', some beast youkai can use sorcery, but they are generally physically-oriented. They can have various characteristics such as great strength and speed, or enhanced senses. Their existence is also less spiritual than that of normal youkai, and because of this they are more resistent to spiritual attacks, but it is also harder for them to restore if their bodies are destroyed.
The number of tails of a youkai beast can indicate the amount of power they posses, and more tails generally means more youkai power.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1751">{{nihongo|'''Buddhas'''|仏|hotoke}} are the reincarnation of spirits of people who have attained full enlightenment. While they are often grouped up with [[god]]s, they are very different in many ways. They are different than gods like the [[Yaoyorozu no Kami]] in that buddhas are pacifistic and are there to guide other people into enlightenment while the gods ally with humans seeking worship and can act aggressive when given the situation. While the buddha is a reincarnation of an enlightened person, a god can be born biologically, evolved from a living creature who attained some form of divinity, or simply having an unknown origin.

==Buddhas in Touhou==
Buddhas are mentioned by [[Byakuren Hijiri]] in ''[[Undefined Fantastic Object]]''. While she states that [[youkai]], [[god]]s and buddhas as the same, she appears to leave buddhas out in later comparisons to youkai. In [[Sanae Kochiya]]'s senario B, Byakuren tells Sanae that a god such as herself could understand her ideals, and in scenario A, tells her that she is shallow for blindly following [[Kanako Yasaka]]'s orders. This indicates that while Byakuren will follow the teaching of the Buddha and relies of their guidance; she makes the distinction between that and the teachings of a god.

While mentioned, none have been confirmed to have appeared as of yet. In ''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'' chapter 9, Marisa and Reimu are listing off some of Reimu's recent opponents and mention one being a buddha, which appears to be a reference to Byakuren. Reimu decides she probably counts as a buddha, but is a bit unsure.

Cats and their youkai counterparts can be found in [[Former Hell]] under the ownership of [[Satori Komeji]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4953">{{Nihongo|'''Celestials'''|天人|tennin|literally "sky person", "heaven person" or "[[wikipedia:Deva (Buddhism)|deva]]"}} are former [[human]]s, a type of [[hermit]] that live in [[Heaven]].

==Lifestyle and General Characteristics==
Celestials can be divided in two classes: those who gained immortality and ascended to [[Heaven]], and those who attained enlightenment and entered Nirvana after death; the latter lack physical bodies and must possess others to re-enter the world. An earthly [[hermit]] can undergo training to qualify for promotion to celestial, but most celestials are transformed from normal humans on a case-by-case basis.

Unlike [[human]]s who have daily hard lives on earth, celestials live in a carefree manner enjoying music, fishing, and playing games, without any need for work. They usually descend to earth to say absurd things that trouble normal humans and then return to heaven. Since celestials have such dream-like lives, many people naturally would want to become one. However, because a celestial must be free of worldly desires, one of the requirements is ''not'' to want to be a celestial, making most people unsuited for this position.&lt;ref&gt;[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Celestials|Perfect Memento in Strict Sense - Celestials]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike that of a normal [[hermit]], a celestial's flesh is toxic to [[youkai]], meaning they are almost never attacked by youkai. A celestial can also fly, tame even the most ferocious beasts simply by holding out a hand, and ride the clouds in a frightening, godlike manner.

According to [[Komachi Onozuka]], celestials are not truly immortal. Instead, they continually extend their lifespans by defeating the [[shinigami]] that regularly come for them.&lt;ref name="SWRKomachi"&gt;[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]] - Komachi's scenario&lt;/ref&gt;. In this regards, celestials fear the "five appointed weakeners". One of these weakeners are shinigami, who have the ability to wither the celestials' flower crowns.&lt;ref name="SWRKomachi"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In Buddhism, a deva shows five signs of weakness before their imminent death. These signs are what [[Youmu Konpaku]]'s spell card [[Perfect_Cherry_Blossom/Spell_Cards/Stage_5#Spell_Card_085|Deva Realm Sword "Five Signs of the Dying Deva"]] refers to. In the [[Grimoire of Marisa]], they are listed as follow: constant uneasiness, withering of flower crown, perspiration of the armpits, blemishing of the clothes, and odorous body.&lt;/ref&gt; Komachi explains to [[Kasen Ibaraki]] that shinigami being sent to end lives is a widespread lie, and that the killer is actually a [[kishin]]&lt;ref&gt; Chapter 12 of [[Wild and Horned Hermit]]&lt;/ref&gt;, but it's unknown how this relates to the celestials' general fear of the five weakeners. It's known, however, that Tenshi has fought off other shinigami before Komachi. &lt;ref name="SWRKomachi"/&gt;

As shown in the case of Tenshi, who was made to leave Heaven when she consumed the elixir that was prepared for a banquet (an elixir that she mistook for bad-tasting dumplings),&lt;ref&gt;[[Antinomy of Common Flowers/Story/Tenshi's Scenario|Antinomy of Common Flowers - Tenshi's Scenario]]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="WaHH46"&gt; [[Wild and Horned Hermit]] Chapter 46 &lt;/ref&gt; it seems that a celestial can be banished from Heaven if there is reason to do so.

==Celestials' Items==
;Veils
Celestials are known to be granted veils by the lord of [[Heaven]], and legends say a celestial maiden whose veil is stolen must remain on Earth and marry the thief. In recent times some have started "losing" their veils on purpose and waiting for a man to pick it up, staying with him if he's attractive and taking it back if he isn't.&lt;ref&gt;[[Symposium of Post-mysticism/Kakashi Spirit News 3|Symposium of Post-mysticism, Kakashi Spirit News 3: The Legend of Husband-Hunting Veils]]&lt;/ref&gt; This has caused humans to become wary, and nowadays someone who finds a veil is more likely to sell it to a collector. According to [[Eirin Yagokoro]] the [[Lunarian]]s also have veils, but those are noticeably different since they have no mass, are filled with moonlight, and allow travel between the Earth and the [[Moon]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Cage in Lunatic Runagate/First Chapter|Cage in Lunatic Runegate Chapter 1]]&lt;/ref&gt;
;Elixir
According to [[Kasen Ibaraki]], what Tenshi Hinanawi consumed prior to her banishment from Heaven is a celestials' elixir that makes it possible for anyone eating it to become a [[hermit]]. Allegedly, it also makes someone's flesh harder than steel, and lets them cast "all sorts of spells".&lt;ref name="WaHH46"/&gt;

In modern use, chimera can refer to any similar "jigsaw puzzle" creature with body parts from multiple sources.

==Chimera in Touhou==
Chimeras are usually created artificially by combining two or more animals into one, but natural-born specimens are not unknown. In either case, most chimeras have a dramatically shortened lifespan.&lt;ref name="bou_n_1"&gt;''[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]]'': [[Symposium of Post-mysticism/Nue Houjuu|Nue]]&lt;/ref&gt;

While the youkai known as [[Nue]] is depicted as a chimera-like creature, there is no documentation of what Nue actually looked like. There is no relation between the chimera and the youkai Nue.&lt;ref name="bou_n_1"&gt;''[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]]'': [[Symposium of Post-mysticism/Nue Houjuu|Nue]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Outside World]] a winged feline chimera exists on the abandoned [[TORIFUNE]] space station; this is presumably a natural chimera born from one of the normal animals kept there.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Trojan Green Asteroid]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2303">[[File:FS Chupacabra.png|thumb|right|[[Tupai]] the Chupacabra in ''Forbidden Scrollery'']]

A ''chupacabra'' or ''chupacabras'' is a [[cryptid]] native to the American continents, particularly from the southwestern United States to Latin America. It has reportedly been sighted as far north as Maine and as far south as Chile and even in Russia or The Phillipines. It was first widely reported in Puerto Rico in the mid-'90s. 

Chupacabras can be literally translated as "goat-sucker", from chupar ("to suck") and cabra ("goat"). They are known for puportedly piercing and draining their victims, mostly livestock, of their blood. However, many reported attacks are assumed to be due to canines afflicted with mange.

They are typically described as being small, about three to four feet, and lizard-like with spines down its back. They may otherwise be known as more canine-like. They typically have fangs and claws which are used to pierce the victim.

==Chupacabras in Touhou==
[[Tupai]], a chupacabra, is the pet of the [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]], mistakenly named after treeshrews, otherwise known as tupai. It escapes the Scarlet Devil Mansion prior to ''[[Forbidden Scrollery]]'' chapter 6. After drinking its fill of sake around the [[Human Village]], arousing the suspicions of humans, it is captured by [[Hieda no Akyuu]] in chapter 7 after setting up a trap. Akyuu and [[Marisa Kirisame]] don't know what to make of it, but [[Mamizou Futatsuiwa]] drops by and lets them know just what it is. While searching for it [[Sakuya Izayoi]] describes it as being "sharper than a goblin".

It is fast, with good jumping ability, with fangs and sharp claws on its hands and feet. It is so fast that Sakuya needs to stop time to capture it again after [[Reimu Hakurei]] breaks Mamizou's seal on a jar used to hold it. Typically kept in a cage, it was adopted as part of [[Remilia Scarlet]]'s interest in expensive items and imports from the [[Outside World]]. She believes it to be cute, while the rest of the mansion residents see it as a convenient way to occupy Remilia and [[Flandre Scarlet]].

==Crabs in Touhou==
Assuming that [[Gensokyo]] lacks any bodies of saltwater, freshwater crabs are among some of its native fauna. While there are youkai crabs in Japanese mythology, it is unknown if there are any in Gensokyo.

{{nihongo|'''Crows'''|カラス|karasu}}, also {{nihongo||鴉|karasu}}, refers to any animal within the genus ''Corvus'' in the family ''Corvidae''. This genus includes true crows, ravens, rooks, and jackdaws. Of the three birds within this genus not called a crow, the raven resembles and is misidentified as a crow. Crows are also considered one of the smartest animals on earth due to their learning capabilities and ability to make tools. In the ''[[Touhou Project]]'', crows can be found within [[Youkai Mountain]] near [[Tengu]] territory, and [[raven]]s can be found in [[Former Hell]].

==Types of Crows==
===Raven===
{{Main|Raven}}
Although technically a raven is a crow, not all crows are ravens due to distinct features that make them different.

==The Crow's Appearances==
===PC-98===
[[File:Th02Crow.png|frame|Sprite of crows in ''[[Story of Eastern Wonderland]]'']]
;Story of Eastern Wonderland
Crows appeared as a general enemy on [[stage]] 2 and the the Extra stage of ''[[Story of Eastern Wonderland]]''. Despite their [[bat]]-like appearance, they were officially referred to as {{nihongo|"crows"|からす}} in the [[Story of Eastern Wonderland/Translation/Other|strategy guide]]. They'll come scrolling down towards [[Reimu Hakurei]] and [[Genji]], shooting small white [[danmaku]]. They are trivial to deal with, but if playing on Lunatic, they'll shoot danmaku as return fire if defeated. They also re-appear on stage 4, coloured in blue.

===Windows===
;''Mountain of Faith''
Crows as a stage enemy first appeared on stage 4 of ''[[Mountain of Faith]]''. After defeating [[Momiji Inubashiri]], a large group of crows will fly over the screen. Before encountering [[Aya Shameimaru]], they'll come in large groups, shooting yellow [[danmaku]] at the player.

;''Scarlet Weather Rhapsody''
[[File:Th105Crow.png|frame|Crows in ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]'']]
Crows re-appear in ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]'' as Aya's familiar. They only appear in the [[spell card]] ''Pelting in the Night'', where once triggered, a calls of murderous crows will attack the opponent. The attack delay is lengthy, allowing easy co-ordination. Since they are just normal crows, they flee when the opponent attacks them.

In Japan, they're more commonly called UMA, similar to how UFO is used.

There is no real difference than a regular animal other than being out of place (habitat limitations) but some may possess some unique traits. They would function and look no different than any other living creature that is known to exist today and if they are ever found to exist then they would be placed within their correct species, genus, etc. Some are animals that used to live before but have gone extinct. Few cryptids were found to exist after scientific study and finds.

==Cryptids in Touhou==
In the [[Touhou Project]], cryptids are animals that are still rare and unknown to many in [[Gensokyo]]. [[Kasen Ibaraki]]'s ability over animals allows her to even control these legendary/unknown beasts.

It is unknown if cryptids like regular animals can become [[youkai]] [[beast]]s as well. While the extinct [[wolf#yamainu|yamainu]] commonly known as the Japanese wolf would be considered cryptids if alive in the [[outside world]], it appears as a common animal that never went extinct in [[Gensokyo]]. In the case that the yamainu is a cryptid, then the [[okuri-inu]] is the only known cryptid to turn into a youkai beast. However becuase the yamainu actually existed, it would not be a mythological animal.

A {{nihongo|'''Cyborg'''|サイボーグ|saibōgu}} is a living organism that has been augmented by the installation of artificial components.  Organisms that become cyborgs do not go under genetic change as with organism that become [[youkai]], such as a cyborg {{nihongo|[[human]]|人造人間|jinzōningen}} will retain all their genes of a human. Organisms that are recreated as machines or go under a 100% transformation are not cyborgs due to all biological parts being removed and are then considered [[robot]]s.

"Giant") was a mythical giant [[youkai]] in [[wikipedia:Japanese mythology|Japanese mythology]]. It is said that he was so big, he was able to create innumerable lakes and ponds with his footprints. In one legend, the Daidarabotchi wanted to compare which was heavier; [[wikipedia:Mount Fuji|Mount Fuji]] or [[wikipedia:Mount Tsukuba|Mount Tsukuba]]. He weighed them on a great scale, and when he was finished with them he dropped the latter and its peak split in two.

==Daidarabotchi in Touhou==
In the [[Touhou Project]], [[Cirno]] thought she saw a Daidarabotchi in ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]'' and thought if she can defeat it, she doesn't have to be afraid of anything again. It turned out to be [[Hisoutensoku]], and Cirno ended up fighting [[Alice Margatroid]] with the [[Goliath Doll]], who is a giant [[Doll]]. It is unknown whether there are any Daidarabotchi in [[Gensokyo]] or not.

{{nihongo|'''Demon'''|魔物|''mamono''|lit. "demonic thing" or "sorcerous thing"}} is a term commonly used to refer to malevolent supernatural beings in religious folklore and literature. In their typical pop culture depictions demons are strongly associated with magic, can be created or controlled, have the power to possess others, and may be fallen [[angel]]s.

==Demons in Touhou==
Demons originate from [[Makai]] (the Demon World), and as such most of their appearances are in the [[PC-98]] [[canon]]. Since Makai was created by [[Shinki]], it can be presumed that all the residents were also created by her. While demons may exist in the [[Windows]] games, no beings have been clearly identified as such.

==The Demon's Appearances==
===PC-98===
;''Mystic Square''
[[File:Th05EarlyDemons.png|frame|left|Sprite of demons from stage 1 and 3]]
Since ''[[Mystic Square]]'' had [[Makai]] as the main theme of the game, demons were among the common general enemy that appeared throughout the game. In relation to the story, [[Shinki]] allowed a tourist agency in Makai to organise trips for the demons to the human world of [[Gensokyo]], which caused problems in Gensokyo, along with having them running around the [[Hakurei Shrine]].

They first appeared on stage 1 then again on stage 3, only having blonde hair and a blue dress. They later re-appeared on stages 5 and 6, but having different coloured dresses such as blue, green and red, along with having their arms streching out similar to that of [[Rumia]]. These later demon appear more stronger and shoot more complex [[danmaku]]. The [[Wheel Demon]] appeared to use the same red sprite as the stages 5 and 6 enemies.

On stage 4 and the Extra stage, there were [[humanoid]]s with blond hair and a white dress that had wings; because of these wings and the fact they appeared in Makai, it can't be definite whether they are demons or [[fairy|fairies]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1987">'''Devil'''s ({{lang|ja|悪魔}} ''akuma'') are supernatural creatures often considered to be the same as or different from [[demon]]s. This is all dependent on the culture or myths that these creatures are being based on. They appear in various religions as an evil entity against mankind and their [[god|deity]]. Devils are commonly portrayed with horns and wings.

==Sub-species==
===Vampire===
:''Main article: [[Vampire]]''

==Devils in Touhou==
Devils are a species of [[youkai]]. The [[vampire]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Imperishable Night|''Imperishable Night'']]:  [[Remilia_Scarlet#Official_Profiles|Remilia Scarlet - キャラ設定.txt]] "Devils, including vampires, are hated with a passion by both humans and youkai, because their kind tend to be self-centered and selfish." &lt;/ref&gt; is a sub-species of devil that originates from outside of [[Gensokyo]]. Devils like the vampire appear to be Western in descent rather than the Eastern creatures like the youkai of Japanese folklore. According to ZUN, [[Magician]]s can also be considered a kind of devil.&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/ZUN%27s_former_blog_%22Touhou_Shofu%22_6 ZUN's former blog Touhou Shofu 6] "悪魔は吸血鬼や魔法使いなどと同じ物で強大な種族ですが" (Devils are a large species that can include vampires and magicians among other similar things)&lt;/ref&gt; Devils also seem to be related to the world of [[Makai]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Perfect Cherry Blossom|''Perfect Cherry Blossom'']]: [[Perfect_Cherry_Blossom/Story/Sakuya's_Extra|Sakuya's Extra Stage Scenario]] "Hell is not as scary as Makai.

A {{nihongo|'''divine spirit'''|神霊|shinrei}} is the spirit of a human who achieved godhood, either during their life or after their death. These are the spirits that live in Shinto shrines and are worshipped. Like gods, they are powered by faith, but have no relation to the [[Yaoyorozu no Kami]].

Apparently, they are able to speak aloud, but in an extremely soft manner. [[Shrine maiden|Shrine maidens]] are able to communicate their words to others using certain techniques.

==Sub-Species==
===Yokurei/Zokurei===
{{nihongo|'''Greedy Spirits'''|欲霊|Yokurei}}/{{nihongo|'''Vulgar Spirits'''|俗霊|Zokurei}} are low class vengeful spirits born from desires. They were mistaken as regular divine spirits during the events in ''[[Ten Desires]]''. [[Youmu Konpaku]] called them Yokurei while [[Mononobe no Futo]] and later [[Sanae Kochiya]] called them Zokurei.

==Divine Spirit's Appearance==
{{Main|Ten Desires/Gameplay#Spirits|l1=Ten Desires: Gameplay (Spirits)}}
[[File:Th11EvilSpirits.png|frame|left|Sprite of divine spirits in ''[[Ten Desires]]'']]
Divine spirits appear in ''[[Ten Desires]]'' as both part of scoring and as a general [[stage enemy]]. The divine spirits in this game are not truly divine spirits. Rather, they are the greedy spirits of little divine spirits. They are fleeting existences that come and go, born from prayers, of a spirit in the stages just before becoming a [[god]].

In gameplay, divine spirits will drop onto the screen when the player defeats an enemy. There are four coloured spirits that each have their own value: blue adds +10 to the player's point item value (+100 while in a trance state), grey acts as a point item, green adds +1 to the player's bomb meter and purple adds +1 to the player's extend meter. These will appear depending on how you deal with a boss or enemy and they'll only last on the screen for 10 seconds. They also fill the trance gauge slightly.

As general enemies, despite their similarities on their sprites, they are not to be confused with the [[evil spirit]]s in ''[[Subterranean Animism]]''. Since [[Youmu Konpaku]] was only interested on getting rid of unwanted spirits, these spirits aren't residents of the [[Netherworld]], thus proving that they're indeed divine spirits. For why there were divine spirits even going to the [[Netherworld]] on Stage 1 is unknown. On stage 6, they come in queues with a [[Sunflower Fairy]] in front, where if the fairy is defeated, then all spirits in that line are auto-defeated.

There was also one blue-coloured divine spirit that appeared as a midboss on stage 1. This appeared to summon red divine spirits appear around this spirit. However, this hasn't been confirmed. It's actually the first divine spirit to appear in the game as an enemy.

===Sagacious Spirit===
Not much is known about {{nihongo|'''Sagacious Spirits'''|仙霊|Senrei}} other than that they are difficult to distinguish from a regular divine spirit&lt;ref&gt; [[Strange Creators of Outer World/Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom interview with ZUN|Strange Creators of Outer World - Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom interview with ZUN]]&lt;/ref&gt;. However, one can speculate based on the 仙 kanju that they are essentially [[hermit]]s. The only character under this sub-species is [[Junko]], who lives in a [[senkai]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Strange Creators of Outer World/Who's Who of Humans &amp; Youkai in Gensokyo|Strange Creators of Outer World: Who's Who of Humans &amp; Youkai]] - [[Strange Creators of Outer World/Who's Who of Humans &amp; Youkai in Gensokyo/Junko|Junko]]&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2393">A {{nihongo|'''Doll'''|人形|ningyō}} is an artificial object most often of small size and with [[human]] or humanoid appearances.

==Dolls in Touhou==
In the ''[[Touhou Project]]'', although normally inanimate in the [[Outside World|outside world]], [[Gensokyo]] dolls seem significantly more mobile. This is usually (though not always, as in the case of [[Medicine Melancholy]]) due to being magically controlled by a puppeteer, such as [[Alice Margatroid]]. The dolls that Alice uses seem unlimited in number, as she regularly sacrifices them in explosive attacks and never seems to run out. It's no wonder certain dolls feel like victims.

In order to perfect a completely autonomous doll, Alice does experiments, and the link to that with the "soul" is detailed. In ''[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]'', [[Eirin Yagokoro]] explained that for a doll to manipulate itself is for a soul to reside in it. Additionally, it is said that dolls that can shed tears and can grow hair are dolls that have acquired a bodily flesh, and by acquiring both the bodily flesh and the soul they are able to move around freely. All of this related to the doll's soul and heart has all been publicly portrayed in many expressions that other characters have said. For example, [[Yukari Yakumo]] commented, "a heart dwelling within a [[human]]-shaped object. How is that different from a [[youkai]], I wonder?" and [[Cirno]] commented, "you keep your dolls close to your heart! You won't find any gaps in a fairy like that!" and [[Reimu Hakurei]] also commented, "thought of holding services for dolls? You know, there are lots of things possessing the stuff that's been made into human form". In actuality, it is unclear if and how Alice puts a soul into the dolls.

When a doll becomes a [[youkai]], like its' inanimate counterpart, they have no life span making them immortal in the sense that they won't naturally die from old age.&lt;ref&gt;[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View/Story/Komachi's Script|''Phantasmagoria of Flower View'': VS Mode]]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7330">A '''Dragon''' ({{lang|ja|竜}} ''ryū'') is usually defined as a large reptilian creature possessing various abilities. They are considered a type of god in much of Asian folklore and monsters in Western folklore.

==Dragons in Touhou==
The [[Dragon (God)|Dragon]] is the highest god in [[Gensokyo]]. It is a being capable of vast amounts of destruction - making thunderstorms occur, destroying mountains and blotting out the sky with a mere roar. However, it is also a deity of creation, responsible for things as fundamental as rainfall or the growth of vegetation. It only reveals itself when Gensokyo is in great peril, and was last seen shortly after the creation of the [[Great Hakurei Barrier]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Dragon|Perfect Memento in Strict Sense - Dragons]]&lt;/ref&gt; The dragon once brought dissonance into the world, from which everything was created and organized into the "ten powers".&lt;ref&gt;[[Curiosities of Lotus Asia/Chapter 19|Curiosities of Lotus Asia - Chapter 19]]&lt;/ref&gt; Other dragons exist as well, though little is known about them.

[[File:FS Dragon God Statue.png|100px|thumb|right|A depiction of the statue from ''Forbidden Scrollery'', chapter 44]]
===The Statue of the Dragon God===
A statue dedicated to the Dragon currently stands in the [[Human Village]]. Its eyes are capable of telling the weather with 70% accuracy, as well as warning of incidents. This is presumably functionality added by the [[kappa]] who chiseled the statue. In ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]'', the color scheme of the weathers seems to partially reflect this. 
* The color for Sunny ([[Reimu Hakurei]]'s weather) is white, 
* The color for Cloudy ([[Sakuya Izayoi]]'s weather) is grey,
* The color for Sprinkle/Drizzle ([[Suika Ibuki]]/[[Marisa Kirisame]]'s weather) is blue.
These are all mentioned in the ''Perfect Memento in Strict Sense'' article. It's also said that the eyes turn red when an incident is about to occur. ''Scarlet Weather Rhapsody'' appears to follow this, as well:
* [[Remilia Scarlet]]'s weather, "Heavy Fog", is red, as she is the culprit behind the Vampire Incident and Scarlet Mist Incident. 
* [[Yukari Yakumo]]'s weather, "Sunshower", is likewise red. She manipulated the border of the [[Netherworld]] to allow [[Yuyuko Saigyouji]] to steal spring in ''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]''.
* [[Tenshi Hinanawi]]'s weather, "Aurora" is red as well. She caused the entire incident in ''Scarlet Weather Rhapsody'', in addition to the destruction of the [[Hakurei Shrine]]. 
In ''[[Forbidden Scrollery]]'', [[Hieda no Akyuu]] claims that "purple" is a more pale version of red and a warning of a typhoon soon to come.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Forbidden Scrollery]] Chapter 44&lt;/ref&gt;

==Birth of dragons==
Various accounts of dragons coming into existence have been given in the series. There's most likely no uniform rule applying to every dragon.

* [[Rinnosuke Morichika]] claims that they are born at sea due to their connection to it, the rain and the heavens. For a dragon to appear, all three must be present. Since Gensokyo doesn't have a sea, an illusory one is used.&lt;ref&gt;[[Curiosities of Lotus Asia/Chapter 15|Curiosities of Lotus Asia - Chapter 15]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Kasen Ibaraki]] mentions that dragons can be born from a {{nihongo|Dragon Stone|龍石|''ryuuseki''}}, a type of {{nihongo|[[Weather Stone]]s|天気石|''tenkiishi''}}. They sometimes appear during a change of seasons with an animal living inside, somewhat similar to an egg.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'' - Chapter 17&lt;/ref&gt; Koutei hatched from a Dragon Stone.
* In the 24th chapter of ''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'', it is said that storm-calling dragons may be born and raised from lizards responsible for the {{nihongo|[[wikipedia:ball lightning|ball lightning]]|球電}} phenomenon. It is also noted that Western and Eastern dragons are thought of as being entirely different creatures, albeit they might have more in common than believed.

==Western Dragons==
{{nihongo|'''Western dragons'''|西洋のドラゴン|''seiyō no doragon''}} are briefly mentioned in chapter 24 of ''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'', but as not a single one of them has ever been shown, not much about them is known. As noted above, western and eastern dragons are thought of as being entirely different creatures even if they share some traits. Moreover, while eastern dragons are called {{nihongo|龍|''ryū''}}, the western species' name is {{nihongo|ドラゴン|''doragon''}}, the english word for "dragon" written in katakana.

==Examples of dragons==

Whether these dragons have any connection to the revered Dragon God is unknown.

===[[Minor Characters#Koutei|Koutei]]===
Koutei is a young Eastern-style dragon that Kasen is able to control with her abilities. First appearing in ''Wild and Horned Hermit''&lt;nowiki&gt;'s&lt;/nowiki&gt; 5th chapter, it abducts Reimu under Kasen's orders. 

===Suiryuu===
Suiryuu is an entity seemingly revered and feared by the [[kappa]]. It was initially thought to be behind the huge spout of water which temporarily destroyed the [[Genbu Ravine]] during the attempted capture of [[Seiga Kaku]] by [[Minor Characters#Suiki|Suiki]] in ''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'' chapter 12&lt;/ref&gt; There also exist [[Ice Scale]]s which are thought to be the crystallization of this dragon's power. They can only be found during winter and won't melt, even in summer, so they're used by [[Magician]]s to power year-round ice magic.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Forbidden Scrollery]]'' chapter 14&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[Minor Characters#Tenryuu|Tenryuu]]===
Tenryuu is a dragon living in the skies, seemingly identified with the Big Dipper and called the King of Constellations. This dragon is said to be moving in order to devour the North Star, causing an event that will make Heaven and Earth tremble to occur. After hearing the kappa's explanation, Kasen Ibaraki commented that "dragons will become rulers of everything under Heaven as the Heaven-born dragon dances through the sky".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'' - Chapter 25&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[Minor Characters#Evil Dragon|Evil Dragon]]===
In ''[[Forbidden Scrollery]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'s&lt;/nowiki&gt; 9th chapter, the Evil Dragon was accidentally let loose on Gensokyo by [[Kosuzu Motoori]] and Marisa Kirisame from the Night Parade Picture Scroll, though its power had waned. Its form is merely that of a winged, black snake, and it has yet to mature into a true dragon. It appears to reside in the sky. Contrary to its name, it has a genial personality, and was grateful to Kosuzu and Marisa for its release, giving them presents in exchange.

===[[Yachie Kicchou]]===
Yachie is a Jidiao who is the leader of the Kiketsu Family.

==Trivia==
* [[Hong Meiling]] uses dragon imagery. Her name, Hong ({{lang|ja|紅}}), has the same reading as [[wikipedia:Hong_(rainbow-dragon)|Hong]] ({{lang|ja|虹}}), a type of dragon. She also utilizes rainbow-colored danmaku, has the word "dragon" in some attack names, and the kanji on her hat, {{lang|ja|龍|}}, also means dragon. However, there is no known association beyond this.

'''Enenra''' ({{lang|ja|煙々羅}} ''en'enra'', lit. "lightweight fabric smoke") is a Japanese [[youkai]] that is described as a spirit composed of smoke which resides in bonfires or rises out of houses, taking the form of a human. It is also said that an enenra can only be seen by the pure-hearted.

It appears in [[wikipedia:Toriyama Sekien|Toriyama Sekien]]'s ''[[wikipedia:Gazu Hyakki Yagyō|Gazu Hyakki Yagyou]]'' series, in ''[[wikipedia:Konjaku_Hyakki_Shūi|Konjaku Hyakki Shuui]]''.

==Enenra in Touhou==
In ''[[Forbidden Scrollery]]'', after a "word-eating worm" eats one of [[Hieda no Akyuu]]'s scrolls, Akyuu and [[Kosuzu Motoori]] unseal an enenra from the Hieda manuscript of ''Gazu Hyakki Yagyou'' in order to smoke it out. 

However, the enenra escapes and goes around [[Gensokyo]] possessing households, being transferred through sight. When [[Reimu Hakurei]] and [[Marisa Kirisame]] go to Kosuzu for answers, she lies and says the enenra escaped after the word-eating worm ate the page it was located on, but tells them how to defeat it. Physical attacks don't work, but by burning items youkai don't like in a targeted house, it caused a sacred smoke and finally allowed them to reseal the youkai after a days long chase.

A {{nihongo|'''fairy'''|妖精|yousei}} is a small, simple, [[humanoid]] creature of magic that represents some aspect of nature. Many of them are also simple-minded. They tend to have short lives, but they will regenerate immediately after dying. In the games themselves, the fairies are by far the most common general [[Stage enemies|stage enemy]] in the ''[[Touhou Project]]''. The way they shoot [[danmaku]] all depends on what difficulty the player chooses and what [[stage]] they appear in. They can come in different kinds of colored dresses and hair, and can appear bigger than usual at times, such as the [[Sunflower Fairy]].

==Fairies in Touhou==
A fairy may have abilities relating to the four seasons, weather, emotions, longevity, decay, fertility, or other aspects of nature. The power exercised by a single fairy is usually harmless and small scale, so they're more suited to playing around rather than causing major happenings. Fortunately, most fairies are easily amused by pulling pranks on unsuspecting humans. However, since fairies tend to gather in areas frequented by humans and youkai, a large group of fairies may indicate the presence of a powerful youkai.

===Appearance===
In the case for [[Cirno]]'s game sprites and for the fairies who showed up in ''[[Touhou Sangetsusei]]'', there were many who took the form of [[humanoid]] children with wings, usually mayfly- or butterfly-like, though more unusual cases exist (such as [[Cirno]]'s triple icicle wings). It is thus common to perceive all fairies to look that way. However, as an exception, the [[Fairy Maid]]s from the [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]] looked more like adults.&lt;ref&gt;[[Strange and Bright Nature Deity]]: Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it does not seem like all fairies look like young girls. For those who showed up in ''Touhou Sangetsusei'', in terms of design, they actually looked more like little girls than young girls. This is due to the design of [[Makoto Hirasaka]].

Their wings might not be solid; in most depictions, they appear to float over the fairy's clothes, unconnected to their body, and some fairies have shown the ability to hide them&lt;ref&gt;[[Strange and Bright Nature Deity]]: Chapter 19&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Occurrence (birth)===
Fairies spring forth from nature, and as long as that nature is preserved, they're indestructible. On the other hand, if that nature is lost, the fairies who spring forth from that disappear forever. Among the powers of [[Gensokyo]], they exist in considerable numbers, and guessing from sayings in the manga, they are fewer than [[spirit]]s, but are probably around the same number as [[phantom]]s and far greater than the number of [[human]]s. As this is merely numbers, it is not related to their strength.

It's not clear what kinds of fairies spring forth from what kinds of nature, but taking [[Lily White]] as an example who is the "fairy of spring", it can be conceived that the nature is the season of spring. Other than in spring, it is a mystery what Lily does and where she is. Some logical possibilities include the idea that she would sleep due to losing energy or due to being ill-suited to the conditions that she disappears due to coming forth only when the condition is met, or that she turns into another kind of fairy. However, in ''[[Silent Sinner in Blue]]'', since she made an appearance at the party at the [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]], which opened in winter, the possibility that she disappears or becomes debilitated outside of spring is quite low.

To [[Cirno]], the [[Three Fairies of Light]] said, "for your season, when spring arrives, you would then become out of season," and so Cirno provoked that winter ought to fight, thus indicating a high possibility that when the nature from which the fairy sprung forth becomes weak, the fairy would become weaker accordingly, and that the fairies are aware of this themselves. However, when it is not winter, since Cirno does not seem to become extremely weakened, this might just be a mistake due to the Three Fairies of Light. In the first place, since it has not been seen that Cirno becomes stimulated upon the arrival of winter the same way as for Lily White of spring, and since it seems like she does not really like winter all that much due to its boredom, she might not actually be a fairy who springs forth from winter.

Since they spring forth from nature, they do not leave children, as it would be unnecessary in the first place. However, with the introduction of [[lampad]]s with [[Clownpiece]], there are now also a species of fairies that can be said to be born from other beings, and [[ZUN]] also confirmed the idea of lampads in the ''[[Strange Creators of Outer World]]'' interview.

===Size and height mystery===
[[File:FS Three Fairies of Light.jpg|thumb|left|150px|The [[Three Fairies of Light]] in ''[[Forbidden Scrollery]]'', where [[Sunny Milk]] is shown considerably smaller than [[Marisa Kirisame]]]]
Their height is uniformly small, where they can fit in the palm of a hand, up to the size of a child below ten years of age; there is hardly any fairy outside of this scope.&lt;ref name="PMiSSFairy"&gt;[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]: [[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Fairy|Fairy]]&lt;/ref&gt; This was said in ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'', which is not reliable due to requests from the [[youkai]] to change how strong they seem, but due to the number of fairies and their range from the [[Human Village]], it's likely that there'd be no reason to write lies in relation to fairies. However, since it was written that there are merely "hardly any" fairies outside of the scope, that still leaves open the possibility of exceptions.

In reality, girls of 9 years of age have the average height of around 130cm, so a fairies size goes from being in palm of a hand to around 130cm. As for whether there would be an exception to being bigger than this, it is a mystery since there is much conflicting information regarding their size. Since they a characteristic of become stronger or weaker depending on their surroundings, they might possibly also change their size due to their surroundings as well, although that's just speculation.

In chapter 8 of ''[[Strange and Bright Nature Deity]]'', [[Sakuya Izayoi]] intended to capture [[Lily White]] in a bottle. If this is not a misunderstanding, then Lily White would be extremely small. However, it is somewhat of a question as for whether this actually did happen since there were not many scenes in the manga where her size could be compared to surrounding objects, so it is a mystery if Lily White really is tiny. However, she was seen at normal size in chapter 9 of ''[[Silent Sinner in Blue]]'', ''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]'' and ''[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]''.

In the manga, the [[Three Fairies of Light]] were shorter than [[Marisa Kirisame]]. Marisa's size is "fairly short", while [[Cirno]]'s size is "short", where other characters in the same category are [[Remilia Scarlet]], [[Lyrica Prismriver]], [[Chen]], [[Rumia]] and [[Flandre Scarlet]].&lt;ref name="ZUN'sEmail"&gt;[[ZUN/ZUN's E-mails|ZUN's E-mails]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Accordingly in the scenes where Cirno and the three fairies played or performed pranks together, where there is not much of a difference in height to be seen between them, they are probably around the same height as the aforementioned characters as well. Also in ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]'', when comparing Cirno against Remilia, their heights are very similar.

However, in Shanghai Alice Correspondence Three Fairies Version Volume 2, concerning the three fairies' place of residence, it stated, "in each of their rooms, it is about one mat spacious, and on the level of 1 meter tall, and a place that is definitely not spacious enough for adult [[human]]s to enter." As such, it can be understood to be considerably narrow. Interpreted as it is, their height would be less than 100cm, but since in the manga, they reach the ceiling to the extent that others usually do, they're conceivably of a height even shorter than this. However, even if they live in such a small space, it was said that they lived in a large tree, but if their residence is this small, then it becomes impossible to see it as so giant of a tree, thus complicating the issue of their size and residence. There was one time when Cirno went into the three fairies' residence, but it was extremely confined. However, since the size of the room became clear; there are interpretations that they might become smaller upon entering their residence. The world's largest tree is a giant sequoia that's around 11.1m in diameter and it'd probably be difficult to create several rooms 1 mat wide and 1 meter tall.

There's a sense that it'd be impossible consider it a place to live for [[human]]s, and for fairies to live there would be a plus to the tree, as it's been confirmed that living there has an effect of promoting its growth, but even considering this, it still seems inconceivable that no damage would be dealt to the tree by physically removing a great amount of space from the middle of the tree, as in the case for flowers, there'd be the possibility of inflicting fatal damage even for fairies at a tiny size. However, one thing to be noted is that when the three fairies change residence, they diligently move all their belongings, but it doesn't seem like they do large-scale work even if the tree was split in two by lightning&lt;ref&gt;Strange and Bright Nature Deity - Chapter number needed&lt;/ref&gt;. This leads to several logical conclusions, such as the possibility that their place of residence is like another dimension, and thus the size of the tree could be smaller than their residence, or that the fairies become smaller when they enter. Of course, they may actually truly be that small.

===Life span, going out of commission===
Since they exist only in the bounds that the nature they spring from be preserved, they're [[immortal]] in some sense. It's unknown if they have everlasting youth, but there hasn't been a depiction where any have been depicted to have aged appearance-wise. In the afterword for ''[[Strange and Bright Nature Deity]]'' Vol. 1, it stated, "minors are prohibited from drinking sake, but since fairies are long-lived, in order not to misunderstand..." and if this is to be followed, then the Three Fairies of Light would be at least 20 years of age (NB: the drinking age in Japan is 20). In ''[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]'', [[Cirno]] said, "It's the festival that happens once every sixty years!" and if Cirno did experience the previous cycle's incident, then Cirno would've lived for at least 60 years.

However, fairies aren't undying, as it's been made clear that there's a condition that's like death, mentioned in ''Strange in Bright Nature Deity'' as {{nihongo|"going out of commission"|一回休み}}, and the fact that [[Komachi Onozuka]] states fairies have got no life span, being similar to [[phantom]]s.&lt;ref name="PoFVKomachi"&gt;[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]: [[Phantasmagoria of Flower View/Story/Komachi's Script|Komachi's Script]]&lt;/ref&gt; The reasons for death aren't different at all from that of a [[human]], and for example, at New Year's Eve, there was a conversation at the [[Hakurei Shrine]] where [[Star Sapphire]] said, "I heard the humans have a custom where they'll get drunk and fall asleep and freeze to death in the snow," to which [[Sunny Milk]] responded, "Haha, how peaceful. We'd only be dead until sunrise, though."&lt;ref&gt;[[Strange and Bright Nature Deity]]: Chapter 15&lt;/ref&gt; Since this was said on New Year's Eve, in the understanding of the [[Three Fairies of Light]], it seems like they'd recover in a night, but also it seems like this speed would be different depending on the circumstances.

In ''[[Subterranean Animism]]'', the [[Zombie Fairy|Zombie Fairies]] were merely pretending to be zombies, but in the game itself, they became half-transparent and stopped, and recovered a few seconds later.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Grimoire of Marisa]]: [[The Grimoire of Marisa/Orin's Spell Cards|Orin's spell cards]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Double Spoiler]]: [[Double Spoiler/Spell Cards/Level 8|Level 8 spell cards]]&lt;/ref&gt; However it is conceived, they recovered instantly. A possibility is that this is convenient for gameplay, or that they might just be fairies that recovered extremely fast.

Even when speaking of a "finished off" state, since it's an incident occurring within the [[spell card]] rules, it can be conceived that they don't die at all, and that to "go out of commission" is something different from death. This somewhat resembles the debate as for whether [[Fujiwara no Mokou]] actually dies when she uses "resurrection" (die and immediately recover) or if it is simply a performance in spell card battles. It's been said that in battles under the spell card rules, death does occur due to accidents, but this is probably not something that would occur frequently.

Fairies live pretty much everywhere, be it in [[Gensokyo]], the [[Underworld]], [[Makai]] and even in [[Hell]] or on the [[Moon]]&lt;ref name="LoLKReisen"&gt;''[[Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom]]'': [[Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom/Story/Reisen's Scenario|Reisen's Scenario]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CPProfile&gt;[[Clownpiece]]'s Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom profile&lt;/ref&gt;. Since they receive the influence of the surrounding nature in their environment, they have delicate differences in strength and appearance. The [[Three Fairies of Light]] had a residence in the [[Forest of Magic]], and later moved into a tree near the [[Hakurei Shrine]]. [[Cirno]] also has a residence close to the [[Misty Lake]] that is somewhat like an igloo.&lt;ref&gt;Strange and Bright Nature Deity Vol. 2 Special&lt;/ref&gt;

Other fairies also have similar dwellings, but it may take up a great amount of space considering their numbers. As [[Marisa Kirisame]] said, "they mostly cleverly hide themselves in nature, like inside flowers or in the soil"&lt;ref&gt;Oriental Sacred Place, Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt;. Like in the case of the tree used as residence by the Three Fairies of Light, which has apparently visible features like windows, it seems humans would generally not notice a fairy's dwelling, as to them it would look like an ordinary tree. [[Reimu Hakurei]] didn't notice their dwelling despite being near it several times.

As an exception, when Marisa was called over for incident resolution regarding the Three Fairies of Light, she was able to recognize their residence. However, she wasn't seen entering it. There were also cases when the fairies themselves invited others over, but it's unclear what can be confirmed about the kind of place they live in. For the tree that Reimu didn't notice as a dwelling, there was a time when [[Yukari Yakumo]] saw through that they lived there. In the same way, the Three Fairies of Light were able to discover Cirno's residence, and destroyed it, which lead to the events of ''[[Fairy Wars]]''.

The size of their residence is a mystery (refer to the "Size and height mystery section"). Since there was a scene in ''[[Touhou Sangetsusei]]'' where Reimu and the Three Fairies of Light faced each other through a window, since it at least can't be seen that the window and the Three Fairies became smaller, it may just be like another dimension. However, it can't be confirmed that a window was outside.

There are also fairies who live in human-made residences for humans to live in, such as the [[Fairy Maid]]s living in the [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]]. There was also the fairy of rainy season who lived in the attic of [[Kourindou]]. It's unknown if fairies live in the [[Human Village]], but concerning fairies, whose purpose of existence is to perform mischief to humans, it can be considered that there aren't many cases of those who live close to humans.

Perhaps to perform mischief, they frequently appear in the Human Village.&lt;ref name="PMiSSFairy" /&gt; That's the reason why they can be caught, for venting anger on them, which [[Hieda no Akyuu]] also recommended.

Prior to the events of [[Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom]], [[Junko]] and Hecatia Lapislazuli imported several fairies from [[Hell]] to the [[Moon]], but it's stated by [[Clownpiece]] that fairies already lived there even before.&lt;ref name="LoLKReisen" /&gt;''[[Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom]]'': [[Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom/Story/Reisen's Scenario|Reisen's Scenario]]&lt;/ref&gt;. This is supported by [[Clownpiece]]'s game profile stating that there are ''almost'' no fairies on the Moon, implying there must be at least some of them.&lt;ref name=CPProfile /&gt; According to [[Sanae Kochiya]], the presence of fairies, which are considered incarnations of nature, caused an atmosphere to be created, making it possible to breath and talk.&lt;ref name="LoLKSanae"&gt;''[[Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom]]'': [[Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom/Story/Sanae's Scenario|Sanae's Scenario]]&lt;/ref&gt; It's unknown if fairies still live here after the events of ''[[Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom]]''.

===Ecology===
According to ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'', fairies do not require food to stay alive, and there's only been cases of fairies eating food because they seemed delicious. However, they do have taste, and they like food that human children like. [[Luna Child]] is an exception for liking coffee. Coffee was too bitter for [[Cirno]] to drink. Also, they drink alcohol and do get drunk. It also commented that [[Fairy Maid]]s receive no wage, but are instead given food, tea and freedom. There are many depictions of Fairy Maids drinking tea.

There was a scene in ''[[Touhou Sangetsusei]]'' where a fairy changed clothing, and in all scenes so far, they change into clothes of the same design as before. There was also a scene where the [[Three Fairies of Light]] stole some maid clothing from the [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]].

===Activities===
Many fairies see playing mischief on [[human]]s as their purpose in life. In ''[[Touhou Sangetsusei]]'', they often steal and pick up ingredients and tools, like coffee. The [[Kourindou]] has also been a victim to this before. They appear to be disliked by humans.

[[Cirno]] is well-known for freezing frogs. Also, there was a scene where she played hide-and-seek with [[Daiyousei]]. They also went on a "trial of guts" at the [[Hakurei Shrine]] where the three fairies of light and [[youkai]] participated. Fairies often play with each other and other species. According to [[Sakuya Izayoi]], [[Fairy maid]]s are rarely of any use in the [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]], and are unsuited towards performing complex tasks, relating to how fairies are not very smart.

Since fairies maids do at least exist, it means they are at least able to do some tasks a maid can. They have been confirmed to wash clothes, cook and play musical instruments. Thus, despite not being smart, they can still perform a variety of tasks.

===Strength and Danger===
Fairies are weak. They often appear as generic, weak [[stage enemies]] alongside [[phantom]]s and [[flying yin-yang]], and often appear in game just for the sake of being defeated. Unlike spirits, though, most fairies can speak, according to one of [[ZUN]]'s e-mails. [[Daiyousei]] is an exception for having a greater amount of power among the fairies.

When the [[Three Fairies of Light]], who are considered stronger among the fairies, together fought [[Yukari Yakumo]], they were unable to inflict any damage and were called "very weak". In ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'', the fairies [[Cirno]] and [[Sunny Milk]] were evaluated with danger level "low". [[Hieda no Akyuu]] wrote that it is safe to even go and take revenge for their mischief by capturing them. However, Cirno and [[Lily White]] are comparatively strong, so they can be dangerous to the ordinary [[human]].

Sometimes they play "pranks that go too far", like making humans fall from cliffs, and that would be a dangerous aspect of them. Thus, Akyuu recommended to take caution in places where a fairy might be there.

Sunny Milk once said that Lily White was dangerous and one must not get close to her. According to Akyuu, Cirno is one of the stronger of the fairies, and since she is used to battle, Cirno has the upper hand even if she goes against all [[Three Fairies of Light]] at the same time, as shown in ''[[Fairy Wars]]''. Among the fairies, she also has a greater tendency to fight, which makes her more dangerous than normal fairies. According to [[Eiki Shiki, Yamaxanadu]], Cirno has quite a bit of power despite being a fairy.

In ''[[Touhou Sangetsusei]]'', the Three Fairies of Light have had their power levels remain constant throughout. Daiyousei was remarked to be "one with power among the fairies". Thus, to normal fairies, she has more power than the average one, but not enough to match Cirno's level. The fairies appear very powerful in ''[[Fairy Wars]]'', but it was in Cirno's perspective, and she is just capable to stand against [[Marisa Kirisame]], a powerful human.

[[Clownpiece]] is an exceptionally powerful fairy, the strongest that has appeared so far&lt;ref&gt;[[Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom/Music|Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom - Clownpiece's Boss Theme]]&lt;/ref&gt; and that even [[Hecatia Lapislazuli]] considers to be quite strong,&lt;ref&gt;[[Alternative Facts in Eastern Utopia/Article and Interview/Clownpiece and Hecatia Lapislazuli#Interview|Alternative Facts in Eastern Utopia - Hecatia's Interview]]&lt;/ref&gt;  who is capable of fighting against other strong characters such as [[Reimu Hakurei]] and Marisa.

===Intelligence===
Fairies are generally not clever. For example, in the manual for ''[[Fairy Wars]]'', it was remarked, "when the war ends, they will completely forget everything they said." They are about on the level of a child, but there is also variation. Here are examples of things that they can do:

:'''Talk'''
::[[Lily White]] has been depicted to speak more than "spring is here." In fact, all fairies are able to speak, according to one of [[ZUN]]'s e-mails. However, it has been remarked that they would not understand more difficult talk. ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'' mentioned that when one encounters a relatively more dangerous fairy like [[Cirno]], one could get away by confusing them with a riddle.
:'''Read &amp; Write'''
::[[Sunny Milk]] writes kanji in ''[[Touhou Sangetsusei]]''. Cirno writes everything in hiragana, but she sometimes makes mistakes. According to ''[[Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red]]'', Cirno reads the [[Bunbunmaru Newspaper]], meaning she is able to at least understand the kinds of opinion pieces written in them. Also, in [[Hisoutensoku]], she begs for [[Aya Shameimaru]] to write more about her, indicating that she takes at least somewhat of an interest in it. Luna Child also likes to read the Bunbunmaru Newspaper. When there's something she doesn't know, namely about family altars, she goes to do research by reading about it in books, and it appears that she understands it at least somewhat.
:'''Cook'''
::[[Fairy Maid]]s and [[Star Sapphire]] cook. The things Star cooked appear to require the usage of fire, pans, and knives. [[Sunny Milk]] and [[Luna Child]] ran a successful food stall, meaning they are also capable of a good level of cooking.
:'''Remember winter events during spring'''
::In the spring, Cirno remembered the [[Three Fairies of Light]] declaring war back in winter. However, she forgot about it until spring arrived. Luna said that the event where they destroyed Cirno's house was "something that happened way back," which could indicate bad memory or mean that they have a greater sense of time passing than that of a humans.
:'''Run a stall'''
::In ''[[Touhou Sangetsusei]]'', the Three Fairies of Light were seen running a stall at the [[Hakurei Shrine]]. Sunny was selling Oden; Luna was selling alcohol, fuuki miso, [[Wikipedia:yakitori|yakitori]] and pig legs; and Star was selling yoyotsuri, and they looked like they were a success, but nobody bought the out-of-season shaved ice (mizuaji) from Cirno. Cirno also didn't know why nobody bought it.
::Thus, fairies are at least able to understand how running a business works, and able to perform the tasks that are require to prepare and run it.

===Economic impact===
Since they don't require food, and live within nature, they generally have no need for money. Fairies steal things as a prank, but they've said that they never steal money. The three fairies have visited the [[Myouren Temple]] without needing to disguise themselves, indicating that despite their mischief, there is no overt hatred against them.

Despite not needing money to live, some fairies like Cirno or the Three Fairies of Light might decide to start businnesses such as food stalls, presumably to earn money. The latter were apparently quite successful in their intent.

==Fairies' appearance in Touhou series==
{{construction|section}}
===PC-98===
[[File:Th04Fairy.png|frame|Sprite of a fairy in ''[[Lotus Land Story]]'']]
The fairy's first appearance as a general enemy was in [[Stage]] 1 of ''[[Lotus Land Story]]''. They had blonde hair, a red dress and blue wings (although ZUN likely meant them to be transparent due to limitation in 16-color graphics). They only appeared once in a small group, scrolling down the screen not shooting bullets. However, if playing on lunatic, they'll shoot a few bullets. On stages 4 and 5, there appear to be [[humanoid]]-like enemies that appear, although it doesn't confirm that they're fairies due to not having wings; they're likely to be [[youkai]] though.

During the [[Makai]] route ending of ''[[Highly Responsive to Prayers]]'', the [[Yin-Yang Orb]] turned into what appears to be a fairy. On stage 4 and the Extra stage of ''[[Mystic Square]]'', there were humanoids enemies with blond hair and a white dress that had wings; because of these wings and the fact they appeared in [[Makai]], it can't be definite whether they are fairies or [[demon]]s. [[Hikariko]] may also be a fairy, who appears as the [[Boss|midboss]] of stage 4 and 3 of ''[[Lotus Land Story]]'' and ''Mystic Square'' respectively.

===Windows===
;''Embodiment of Scarlet Devil''
[[File:Th06Fairies.png|frame]]
They first appeared on stage 1, as well as on stage 2, coming down the screen in great numbers and in a line. On stage 3, they were mixed in with [[Fairy Maid]]s, where on stage 4 and onwards, only Fairy Maids were shown. The stage 2 midboss and [[boss]] of the game are also fairies, them being [[Daiyousei]] and [[Cirno]] respectively.

;''Perfect Cherry Blossom''
[[File:Th07Fairies.png|frame|left]]
The fairies once again appeared as general enemies in ''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]'' throughout the game. A new feature is that a number of fairies have a magic circle around them, which indicates that they're stronger fairies that'll shoot more [[danmaku]] and that they're non-trivial to defeat. On stage 4 and onward, there appears to be fairies that are re-used from the previous game, being identical to the [[Fairy Maid]]s, although they can be presumed not to be fairy maids due to not being a the [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]] and the fact [[Sakuya Izayoi]] can take them down, knowing that she wouldn't attack her own staff.

On stage 2, they'll first appear in transparent orbs, then after a while of waiting, they'll pop out and immediately shoot [[danmaku]]. On stages 5 and 6, they appear to have some kind of [[ghost]] theme amongst them because each fairies' entrance on the screen start with spiritual-like material flowing through the screen, then appearing as normal. When defeated, they'll return into their spiritual dwellings and move off the screen.

;''Imperishable Night''
[[File:Th08Fairies.png|frame]]
Fairies again make an appearance in ''[[Imperishable Night]]''. There are four different coloured fairies that appear over all: blonde hair with a blue dress (stage 1, 3, 4); blonde hair with a red dress; brown hair with a green dress (stage 2); and blue hair with a yellow dress. There are also another version of these fairies in exact appearance with an hat, where they're shown to be more stronger and non-trivial to take care of; they may also have a magic circle around them. Red dress ones appear on stages 2, 3 and 4, green ones appear on stages 1, 3 and 4; and yellow ones appear on stage 3.

On stage 5 onward, there are another version that has [[rabbit]] ears, along with wearing-hat versions. Whether these meant to be rabbits is unknown. Blue dress ones appear on stage 5. With hat versions, while blue are on Extra stage, red ones are on stage 5, 6 and Extra, green ones are on stage 5 and 6; and yellow ones are on stage 5.

;''Phantasmagoria of Flower View''
[[File:Th09Fairies.png|frame]]
Fairies are yet again the common enemy in ''[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]'', being the primary targets in the game. However, they don't shoot bullets, are extremely easy to destroy by shooting bullets and come in infinite numbers, making [[Reimu Hakurei]] wonder why there are so many fairies. There are four types of fairies; blue dressed with blonde hair holding a leaf, red dressed with silver hair holding what appears to be a white dandelion with somewhat bigger wings, green dressed with brown hair holding some sunflowers with fairly big wings, and white dressed with blue hair holding two big sunflowers with large wings. The latter is known as the [[Sunflower Fairy]] and this is their first appearance in the games, along with the former being standardized throughout the rest of the games. Additionally, a fairy named [[Cirno]] appeared as a playable character.

The fairies come in from the edges of the screen or from the top. Once a fairy is hit, it's defeated, leaving an explosive impact for objects around them (although this does not hurt the player). Shooting one of the fairies in a row usually causes a chain reaction along the entire row. There is one particular fairy that isn't non-trivial to deal with – that being [[Lily White]]. She'll randomly appear on the screen if a fight has gone on for a long time, appearing on both players' fields simultaneously. She will release a large number of large and white bullets before she leaves, which even ZUN says it's "annoying". An EX Attacks appears if she's defeated and she can re-appear.

On the stages for [[Reimu Hakurei]], [[Marisa Kirisame]], [[Reisen Udongein Inaba]] and [[Tewi Inaba]]'s, the fairies have rabbit ears, possibly making a reference to Reisen and Tewi, or being in the [[Bamboo Forest of the Lost]]. On [[Eiki Shiki, Yamaxanadu]]'s stage, the fairies (along with Lily White) are seen dressing like Eiki. [[ZUN]] has stated in a Livestream that the fairies and Lily are simply cosplaying as the [[yama]] herself.

;''Mountain of Faith''
[[File:Th10FairiesAlt.png|frame]]
Fairies again make an appearance in ''[[Mountain of Faith]]'', shooting [[danmaku]] at the player. The game re-uses the blue dressed, blonde hair fairies from the previous game, where they were given three extra colors; red dress with yellow hair, green dress with pink hair, and yellow dress with silver hair. There are also another version of these fairies in exact appearance, but they also with a grey hat with horns and that they wield a sword. These types first appeared on stage 3, and re-appeared on stage 4, 5, 6 and Extra.

On stage 4, the fairies will hide behind [[Youkai Mountain#The Waterfall of Nine Heavens|The Waterfall of Nine Heavens]] and pop out randomly, shooting [[danmaku]].

;''Subterranean Animism''
[[File:Th11FairiesDead.png|frame|Sprite of fairies acting dead]]
[[File:Th11Zombie Fairy.png|frame|left|Sprite of a [[Zombie Fairy]]]]
Fairies again make an appearance in ''[[Subterranean Animism]]'', shooting [[danmaku]] at the player and re-using sprites from the previous game. Fairies don't appear on stages 5 and 6, that being in the [[Remains of Blazing Hell]]. However, during [[Rin Kaenbyou]] [[boss]] fight, she'll summon fairies before her first [[spell card]] ''Cursed Sprite "Zombie Fairy"'', where if they're defeated, they'll give the appearance of being dead with a halo. When the spell card starts, they'll turn into [[Zombie Fairy|Zombie Fairies]]. They're not dead nor are they zombies, they're just acting as though they are. Rin will regularly use the Zombie Fairies during her boss fight.

It should be noted that only the red dress, blonde hair fairies are used in the game, where the other colored sprites of fairies weren't used.

;''Undefined Fantastic Object''
[[File:Th12GhostFairy.png|frame|left|Sprite of a ghost fairy]]
[[File:Th12MakaiFairy.png|frame|Sprite of [[Makai]] fairies]]
Fairies yet again re-appeared in ''[[Undefined Fantastic Object]]'', shooting [[danmaku]] at the player and re-using sprites from the previous game. On stages 5 and 6, the fairies have a unique colour that blends them in with [[Makai]]. One type is pure purple, while the other three types have a black dress, with each other three have pink hair, blue hair and blonde hair. The latter two have scarlet wings, while the former has purple wings.

On stage 6, the fairies travel down in a similar fashion to the Invaders of the [[wikipedia:Space Invaders|Space Invaders]] series, creating an obvious reference in gameplay. They'll shoot bullets downwards and move from left to right and back again, slowly coming downwards. Also, [[Nue Houjuu]] used these fairies during her stage 6 appearance. On stage 4, she used fairies that appear to be a [[ghost]] of some sort, wearing an [[wikipedia:Hitaikakushi|hitaikakushi]]. It's unknown if these relate to the [[Zombie Fairy|Zombie Fairies]].

;''Ten Desires'' / ''Double Dealing Characters''
As always, fairies again appeared on ''[[Ten Desires]]'' and ''[[Double Dealing Character]]'', shooting [[danmaku]] at the player and re-using sprites from the previous game. These re-use the larger fairies seen in ''FW'' and ''PoFV'' and no Makai-types appeared.

;''Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom‎''
Following the tradition, fairies appeared again as common [[stage enemies]] in ''[[Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom]]‎'', shooting [[danmaku]] at the player and re-using sprites from the previous game. On stages 3, 5 and the Extra Stage, only Makai-types appear. Stage 3 and the Extra takes place in the [[Dream World]], and although the fairies shouldn't able to access this place physically, [[ZUN]] does state in the music comments that these are "just things in each dream," but are still mischievous of them to spread barrages of [[danmaku]] despite being in a dream. They're primarily the only stage enemy on Stage 5 as the heroine flies over the [[Sea of Tranquility]] on the [[Moon]], and the [[boss]] of the stage who is a fairy from [[Hell]] is [[Clownpiece]]. They were seen on the Moon because, under [[Hecatia Lapislazuli]]'s orders, Clownpiece sent the fairies from Hell to Sea of Tranquility in order to threaten the [[Lunar Capital]]. They were all, however, defeated.

===Spin-offs===
;''Double Spoiler''
Despite the rare occurrence of enemies in ''[[Double Spoiler]]'', [[Zombie Fairy|zombie fairies]] make a re-appearance in the game, supporting [[Rin Kaenbyou]].

;''Fairy Wars''
[[File:Th128FairiesAlt.png|frame|Sprite of extra fairies in ''[[Fairy Wars]]'', ''[[Ten Desires]]'' and ''[[Double Dealing Character]]'']]
Fairies are the main focused theme and prime species in ''[[Fairy Wars]]'', where it's [[Cirno]] (the protagonist) versus the [[Three Mischievous Fairies]] (the antagonists), along with [[Daiyousei]] and [[Lily White]] being midbosses and the [[Sunflower Fairy|Sunflower Fairies]] with regular fairies being the only enemies to appear in the game. The three fairies destroyed Cirno's home at the [[Misty Lake]], so she takes revenge by declaring war on them. To get to them, Cirno must fight various fairies on her paths towards her target. She can use her new freezing ability to freeze [[danmaku]]. She cannot freeze fire bullets, which is a new bullet feature the fairy enemies use. As usual on the Extra stage, the fairies are brutal with their danmaku.

Sprites from previous games are used for the different types of fairies, including two that were last seen in ''[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]'' (Shown to the right). First type has silver hair while the next type has light brown hair. They both come in their own two pair; the first types having a blue dress and a red dress while the second types have a light brown dress and an aqua dress. These fairies are not trivial to deal with, but Cirno's ability can defeat them quicker. Also, the [[Makai]] sprites of the fairies are re-used from ''[[Undefined Fantastic Object]]''. From the looks are these fairies, it appears that [[ZUN]] tried to include as many fairies as possible that've appeared in the games, except for pre-PoFV ones.

===Literature===
;''Curiosities of Lotus Asia''
On Chapter 9 of ''[[Curiosities of Lotus Asia]]'', there were {{nihongo|"fairies of rainy season"|梅霖の妖精}}, who make rain fall around their surroundings. They settled down around [[Kourindou]] but ran away due to [[Reimu Hakurei]]'s threats. On Chapter 12, there was a {{nihongo|"fairy from the forest"|森の妖精}}, who does not seem to do such dangerous play as making icicles fall.

;''Touhou Sangetsusei''
The ''[[Touhou Sangetsusei]]'' series is centered around the [[Three Fairies of Light]] which shows their daily life in [[Gensokyo]]. [[Cirno]] also makes re-occurring appearances in the series, as well as [[Lily White]] and [[Daiyousei]] having a cameo appearance.

On Chapter 21 of ''[[Strange and Bright Nature Deity]]'', there was a {{nihongo|"fairy who lived in the Mongolian oak"|ミズナラの木に住んでいた妖精}}. This fairy lived in a Mongolian Oak behind the [[Hakurei Shrine]], but due to lightning, the fairy seemed to have gone out of commission.

;''Inaba of the Moon and Inaba of the Earth''
On Chapter 9, there were {{nihongo|"rain fairies"|雨の妖精}} who make rain fall. They are said to be active from the morning on hot days.

In ''[[Ten Desires]]'' during Sanae's extra stage, Sanae's idea on the youkai trump card was a gashadokuro (shortly disproven however). It is unknown whether there are any gashadokuro in [[Gensokyo]] or not.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2453">{{nihongo|'''Ghosts'''|亡霊|bourei}} are the souls of humans who have remained in the physical world. Although they are souls, they have body temperature and are fully corporeal.

==Ghosts and Phantoms==
{{nihongo|Ghosts|亡霊|bourei}} and {{nihongo|[[phantom]]s|幽霊|yuurei}} are more or less interchangeable in normal Japanese language, but are distinct entities in the Touhou series.

Phantoms are not limited to humans, but can come from any living or nonliving thing in which there dwells a particular kind of {{nihongo|spirit|気|ki}}, and due to their shapeless forms it's impossible to determine what kind of being they originally were.

Ghosts are the after-forms of humans who died and become phantoms and have lingering attachments that tie them to the world too strongly. Since, other than humans, there are no living things that die in this manner, there are no ghosts of beings other than humans. From the strength of that attachment, they preserve the form that they had while they were alive, as well as their body temperature, and since they are even able to touch living humans, one might not be able to tell that they are departed spirits if one is an outsider. They are not capable of passing through solid objects like phantoms are.

Generally, a ghost's weakpoint is its own dead body. For the type of ghost who became a ghost from not realising they were dead, seeing proof in the form of their own dead bodies would cause them to revert to a normal phantom. While ghosts who already know that they are dead do not share this weakness, it is common for them to hide their bodies to prevent them from being given a memorial service and achieving nirvana. The likelihood of this occuring has gone down, however, now that more bodies are being cremated.

Since the driving force for a ghost's existence is its attachment, it is common for them to exert a negative influence on the living humans around them just by their presence, which can eventually lead to death. This effect is particularly strong against the source of their attachment (eg. someone against whom the ghost has a grudge), but can affect anyone.

[[File:SSiBAmaterasu.png|thumb|One of the major [[Yaoyorozu no Kami|gods of Shinto]], [[wikipedia:Amaterasu|Amaterasu Oomikami]], appears in ''[[Silent Sinner in Blue]]'' Chapter 16.]]
The term '''god''' refers to concepts such as [[spirit]]s, natural forces and superhuman beings. In Japan's native [[Shinto]] religion, "god" is usually considered equivalent to the term {{nihongo||神|[[wikipedia:kami|kami]]}}. It should be noted, however, that kami include a broader spectrum of beings than those found in [[wikipedia:Monotheism|monotheistic religions]] (e.g. [[Christianity]], Judaism, Islam, Zoroastrianism, etc) or even some [[wikipedia:Polytheism|polytheistic]] ones. Shinto is at its roots an [[wikipedia:Animism|animist]] religion, meaning that any being (alive or dead), object or even phenomenon can be considered a god. Also, it should be noted that the 'G' in "god" should not be capitalized when referring to Shinto gods or any other gods from polytheistic religions.

Like many polytheistic religions (e.g. those of ancient Greece and Rome), Shinto gods live among humans and have direct impact on their daily lives. While their personalities are mostly similar to humans, they possess two aspects known as {{nihongo|''Ara'' and ''Nigi''|[[wikipedia:ja:荒魂・和魂|荒・和]]}}: when they are worshiped they will protect people and grant them {{nihongo|blessings|ご利益|gorieki}}, but when angry they will create disasters and {{nihongo|curses|[[wikipedia:ja:祟り|祟]]|tatari}}. In some cases the Ara and Nigi aspects of a god are so different in appearance and behaviour that they are named or worshipped separately. A {{nihongo|shrine|神社|jinja}} is a place for gods to occupy in order to interact with humans, which can vary in size from a small box or shelf (found in many homes) to an entire building and grounds.

==Types of Gods==
===Dragon===
:''Main article: [[Dragon (Species)|Dragon]]''
{{nihongo|'''Dragons'''|竜|ryuu}} are reptilian creatures viewed as gods in some cultures, and monsters in others.

===Yaoyorozu no Kami===
:''Main article: [[Yaoyorozu no Kami]]''
{{nihongo|'''Yaoyorozu no Kami'''|八百万の神||Lit. "Eight Million Gods"}} is the term in Shinto that is used to refer to gods in general. It also refers to the idea of "believing in Shinto faith".

While conventionally translated as "Eight Million Gods", it uses the older Japanese meaning of {{nihongo|"eight"|八|hachi, ya}} as "myriad"; i.e. the number of gods is actually uncountably large.

===Arahitogami===
:''Main article: [[Arahitogami]]''
{{nihongo|'''Arahitogami''' |現人神||"living god"}} are humans who become gods while still alive, thus being both at once.

===Kahaku===
{{nihongo|'''Kahaku'''|河伯||"river chief"}} are river gods from Chinese folklore. They should not be confused with the [[youkai]] known as the [[kappa]] from Japanese folklore.

===Yatagarasu===
:''Main article: [[Yatagarasu]]''
{{nihongo|'''Yatagarasu'''|八咫烏||"eight-span crow"}} is a divine three-legged [[crow]] that serves the Shinto sun goddess [[wikipedia:Amaterasu|Amaterasu]].

===Divine Spirits===
:''Main article: [[Divine spirit]]''
{{nihongo|'''Divine spirits'''|神霊|shinrei}} are the spirits of humans who ascended to godhood before or after their death.

==Gods in Touhou==
The majority of gods in the ''[[Touhou Project]]'' are drawn from or based on the Shinto religion. However, the Buddhist god [[Bishamonten]] exists, and [[Okina Matara]] is directly based on the Buddhist God [[wikipedia:en:Matara-jin |Matara-Jin]]. Possibly gods from other religions also exist; [[Seiga Kaku]] has made a dismissive reference to Jesus Christ,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Ten Desires]]'' Youmu route&lt;/ref&gt; though his divinity was not confirmed.

===The Shinto Gods in Touhou===
Shinto Gods in the [[Touhou Project]] are "born" from faith and derive their power from it. Note that being "born" can also refer to ascension to godhood, such as the case of [[Mizue no Uranoshimako]], a human who became a god after his death. As they are born from human belief they share some similarities to youkai, and some youkai have argued that the two are practically the same. However, they have many differences, and for the most part can be considered two different "species".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Silent Sinner in Blue]]'' Chapter 17. "You can't fight gods and youkai the same way."&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike youkai, gods are not generally born from fear; thus they do not do things like attacking humans by default, but instead seek out faith, typically in the form of worship.

Faith from either humans or youkai is valid, and is described by Kanako in Reimu's ''[[Mountain of Faith]]'' A ending as a reverence towards existence, a fear of retribution for one's actions, and the will to enrich one's life, spirit, and body, but it doesn't really have to be that serious. Worship and faith can be as simple as just celebrating with your god.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Mountain of Faith]]'' Kanako's profile. "Actually, to play together was what gods wished for." "This was exactly the kind of faith Kanako was wishing for."; Reimu A ending. "There's no difference between faith and the ability to share a nice drink together like this.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shinto gods may split their spirits and manifest where ever called on, enabling them to be in many places at once to serve their worshippers; this doesn't diminish the power of the god in any way, as each split part of the same god would have the same amount of power as the original.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Silent Sinner in Blue]]'', chapter 6&lt;/ref&gt; Certain individuals, such as [[Watatsuki no Yorihime]] and shrine maidens like [[Reimu Hakurei]] and [[Sanae Kochiya]] can directly call upon the gods to enter their bodies. Most gods interact with the physical world entirely in this manner. Some gods have physical bodies which allow them to act independently without being called upon, such as Kanako and Suwako (and likely [[Hina Kagiyama]], [[Minoriko Aki]], and [[Shizuha Aki]]), but this does not prevent them from splitting their spirit or being invoked in the normal ways.

The Shinto gods are well-acknowledged in Gensokyo and by the denizens of the [[Lunar Capital]] (according to Kanako, many of whom have actually been the original gods from relevant mythology, such as [[Sagume Kishin]], as well as [[Lord Tsukuyomi]] and his sister). However, in the [[outside world]], faith has instead been placed on various things such as friendship and news.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Mountain of Faith]]'' Reimu B Ending. In the outside world, people's faith in gods was weakened by the appearance of bad cults and religions.
However, all gods benefit from all faith in them.
Even though faith and entreatment are different things.
Humans, in their independence, lost the need for faith.
Actually, that's not true.
Even now, they have faith deep within their hearts.
People believe in the news, brands, companies, and friends.
The object of their faith has merely shifted closer.
If you're a god who wishes to regain faith from humans...
try setting your pride aside and being friendly with them.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, like youkai, it is difficult for some gods such as [[Kanako Yasaka]] and [[Suwako Moriya]] to survive in the outside world as their faith dies out. Presumably more well-known Shinto gods such as Amaterasu still have plenty of faith to go around in the outside world, as there is nothing to indicate their existence is under threat any time soon; in particular, the god Ame-no-Torifune even [[TORIFUNE|had a space station dedicated to him]].

Of note is that loss of faith for a god means a loss of their ability to manifest their power. For a god, losing all their power is equivalent to death&lt;ref&gt;''[[Mountain of Faith]]'' [[Sanae Kochiya]]'s profile. "When people lose faith in gods, the gods lose their power. They can't manifest their divine virtues. This is the same as death, for a god.&lt;/ref&gt; (with the exception of [[arahitogami]], who would continue to exist as normal humans).

===The Buddhist Gods in Touhou===
Much like how in real life Buddhist and Shinto gods were de facto seen as part of a single system due to the [[wikipedia:Honji_suijaku|honji suijaku]] dogma, the Buddhist gods in Touhou don't seem to function differently from their Shinto peers. 

[[Bishamonten]], being extremely busy, uses [[Shou Toramaru]] as an avatar ([[wikipedia:Gongen|gongen]]) for the temples that Shou works or worked in ([[Byakuren Hijiri]]'s previous temple and her current [[Myouren Temple]]).

[[Okina Matara]] is based on {{nihongo|[http://www.onmarkproductions.com/html/monkey-koushin-p3.html#shinraMYOUJIN Matara-jin]|摩多羅神}}, a god historically venerated mostly by the [[wikipedia:Tendai|Tendai Buddhism]] sect. However, like many other medieval Japanese gods, Matara-jin was neither purely Buddhist nor purely Shinto, and arose from of syncretic traditions combining elements from many religions&lt;ref&gt;https://www.persee.fr/doc/asie_0766-1177_2006_num_16_1_1258&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1701">The '''hakutaku''' ({{lang|ja|白澤}} or {{lang|ja|白沢}}), also known as bai ze, is a mythical beast, sometimes described as a deity, which is said to advise noble monarchs and ward off monsters and epidemics. In Japan it's usually portrayed as a bovine creature with an old man's head with three eyes, with more eyes and sometimes a number of horns on its body.  Chinese depictions sometimes present it as a feline or reptilian, qilin-like creature instead

The hakutaku has its origin in one of the myths about Huang Di (黄帝 or こうてい; read as "Koutei" in Japanese), the mythical first emperor of China. The creature could talk and explained that he only visited the greatest and most auspicious of rulers. The hakutaku went on to explain to the emperor that there were 11,520 [[youkai]] in the world; it also taught the emperor how to escape and exorcise the bad ones and deal with the good ones. The emperor set all that knowledge down in an encyclopedia of youkai, known as the ''Bai Ze Tu'' (白泽图); tradition considers this work to be lost. The myth was first depicted in a Tang era mural from the Mogao caves.

In Japan, the hakutaku was seen first and foremost as a good luck charm warding off diseases. In the Edo period, many attributes of the hakutaku were absorbed by the [[baku]]. As a result Lafcadio Hearn incorrectly assumed the creatures are one and the same.

{{nihongo|'''Haniwa'''|埴輪||}}  are Japanese clay figures made of [[wikipedia:en:Terrakotta|Terrakotta]], often found in burial mounds from the Kofun period from the 3rd to the 6th century. They usually depict military figures, but mikos, animals, and even houses are also known. Like many ancient works of art, they were originally painted, but paints do not keep well.

They were probably placed as guards in front of tombs, but there are also theories that they were supposed to be vessels for the souls of the deceased.

==Haniwa in Touhou==
[[Mayumi Joutouguu]] is the only Haniwa known by name in Touhou. She was pottered by Keiki Haniyasushin and brought to life, but not as a burial gift, but for her takeover as well as guardian of the primate garden in hell.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1073">The Hashihime (橋姫) is a mythical youkai that appears in various Japanese texts (Most notably the The Tale of Heike). After her husband left her and married another woman, the jealous and enraged Hashihime prays to the gods for revenge. A priest tells her a way: She has to dress herself in red and paint her face with the same color, her hair arranged with seven loops and crowned with a burning brazier, then spend 21 days under the Uji bridge while holding a metal rod. So deep was her rage and jealousy, that she actually did the entire process, becoming a vengeful youkai driven by jealousy that only appears in the vicinity of bridges that cross over water. She appears to loving couples, threatening to kill them both unless they break up right there and then. There is also a famous Noh Play about this mythological creature

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6122">{{Nihongo|'''Hermits'''|仙人|sennin|literally "wizard", "transcendent person" or "mountain person"}} are beings endowed with supernatural abilities acquired through religious training. Like [[celestials]], they may live for thousands of years without being actually immortal. However, unlike celestials whose bodies are poisonous to [[youkai]], hermits of earth are considered a delicacy; an animal who consumes the flesh of a hermit would become a youkai, while a youkai who does so would ascend to a higher rank or form.

Hermits spend most of their days reciting sutras every sunrise and sunset. They consume very little food and those older than 500 only have to ingest mist and haze to survive. Occasionally (about once every century), an assassin from [[Hell]] will attack the hermit; if the hermit has slacked off even the slightest in their training, the hermit will not be able to fight them off and will fall to hell. While this assassin is commonly believed to be a [[shinigami]], this is a deception - it is actually one of the chiefs of the [[kishin]].

Since hermits have not completely discarded all their worldly desires, they may often come to help [[human]]s in need. It is said that some youkai exterminators become hermits as a result of their work.

Hermits and [[Lunarian]]s are said to be similar in nature, and like the [[Lunar Capital]] a hermit's home can only be found by following a specific route (which they can change if it is discovered).

==Sub-Species==
===Celestial===
:''Main article: [[Celestial]]''
{{Nihongo|'''Celestials'''|天人|tennin|literally "sky person", "heaven person" or "[[wikipedia:Deva (Buddhism)|deva]]"}} are a higher class of hermits who reside in [[Heaven]]. An earthly hermit can become a celestial by further advancing their training, or a normal human can be transformed into a celestial directly.

===Xian===
'''Xian''' ({{lang|zh|仙}}, {{lang|zh|仚}} or {{lang|zh|僊}}, [[wikipedia:Pinyin|Pinyin]]: ''Xian/Xiān/Xiān'') is a Chinese word for an enlightened person, usually translated as "Taoist immortal". The Japanese word for hermits, {{nihongo|''sennin''|仙人}}, is a borrowing of the less common term ''xianrén'', which combines the characters for "xian" and "person". Xian develop roughly the same abilities as their Japanese counterparts, and are similarly long lived; they are described by [[wikipedia:Victor H. Mair|Victor H. Mair]] as such:

&lt;blockquote&gt;They are immune to heat and cold, untouched by the elements, and can fly, mounting upward with a fluttering motion. They dwell apart from the chaotic world of man, subsist on air and dew, are not anxious like ordinary people, and have the smooth skin and innocent faces of children. The transcendents live an effortless existence that is best described as spontaneous. They recall the ancient Indian ascetics and holy men known as ''ṛṣi'' who possessed similar traits.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Shikaisen (Shijie xian)===
'''Shikaisen''' ({{lang|zh|尸解仙}}, Pinyin: ''Shījiě xiān'', Japanese: ''Shikaisen'', lit. "Corpse Untie Xian") is a class of xian mentioned in [[wikipedia:Baopuzi|Baopuzi]]. Considered the lowest level of immortality one can attain, it is required that a person "fake" their own death by substituting a bewitched object like a bamboo pole, sword, talisman or a shoe for their corpse or slipping a type of Death certificate into the coffin of a newly departed paternal grandfather, which deletes their name and allotted life span. Mortals who choose this route must cut off all ties with family and friends, move to a distant province, and enact the Ling bao tai xuan yin sheng zhi fu ({{lang|zh|靈寳太玄隂生之符}} -- “Numinous Treasure Talisman of the Grand Mystery for Living in Hiding”) to protect themselves from heavenly retribution. So, the body is considered [[immortal]], but immortality may only last as long as a sīmìng ({{lang|zh|司命}}) -- "Director of allotted life spans", lit. "Controller of Fate" allows, agents of death from the underworld can be fended off or life prolonging talismans found. Like hermits and celestials, it is not "true" immortality. Also like celestials, some shikaisen may also serve [[heaven]].

==Hermits in Touhou==
According to [[Seiga Kaku]]'s profile in ''[[Ten Desires]]'', at one point in time, hermits of Taoism were common in her land in the [[outside world]]. During her conversation with [[Youmu Konpaku]], Seiga refers to [[Toyosatomimi no Miko]]'s resurrection as similar to the western prophet Jesus Christ, claiming Miko's to have been far more grand and divine. It is unknown if Seiga witnessed this event or simply heard of it some time later, but if the first were true then this form of resurrection through Taoist teachings or its equivalent may have been common throughout the old world (or Seiga just wasn't impressed).

Japan appears to be one of the few places around this area that wasn't sufficiently populated by Taoist immortals presumably due to the [[Yaoyorozu no Kami]] of Shinto and competition from the more recent arrival of Buddhism. Miko mentions that the Taoist philosophy, aiming to achieve immortality and power is more appealing than overcoming suffering through Buddhism.

It is known from ''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'' and ''[[Oriental Sacred Place]]'' that hermits are allies of humans, sharing a common enemy in youkai.

[[Byakuren Hijiri]] believes that there are probably a number of hermits among the [[tengu]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1449">[[File:Hobgoblin.jpg|thumb|right|150px|A hobgoblin as it appears in ''Wild and Horned Hermit'']]'''Hobgoblins''' are a type of creature found in European folklore. Inhabiting households, they are often depicted as small, hairy little men, who do odd jobs and chores around the house while the family is asleep.

Often benevolent, they may be compensated with food, but shun clothing. They are easily annoyed and like the closely related [[wikipedia:Brownie_(folklore)|brownie]], they enjoy mischievous pranks and practical jokes. In other media, they are sometimes depicted as far more antagonistic and dangerous than their origin.

==Hobgoblins in Touhou==
In ''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'' hobgoblins are brought to [[Gensokyo]] by [[Yukari Yakumo]], as stand-ins for the emigrating [[zashiki-warashi]]. This, however, proves unpopular with the inhabitants of the [[Human Village]], as the hobgoblins' grotesque appearance is a stark contrast to the childlike zashiki-warashi. When [[Kasen Ibaraki]] learns that the other youkai use household spirits to spy on humans, she and [[Reimu Hakurei]] "exterminate" the hobgoblins and drive them from the village.

After the zashiki-warashi return, the hobgoblins find employment at the [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]].

'''Humans''' ({{lang|ja|人間}}, ''ningen'') are a species of [[Beast#Mammal|mammal]] scientifically known as '' Homo sapiens'' that have spread across the [[Outside World|world]] for around 200,000 years. Their success relies heavily on intelligence, unlike other previous dominant species who relied mainly on their biological weaponry. While the intelligence of humans is an advantage over other animals, they are considerably weaker in physical strength compared to other species of similar size and weight. While the spread of humans has often had negative influence to the natural world, other intelligent creatures like the [[crow]] have benefited and are often seen near cities and other urban areas.

==Sub-Species==
===Living Gods===
:''Main article: [[God]]''
{{nihongo|'''Living Gods'''|現人神|arahitogami}} are humans who have become deities while still alive. Since they are both human and god, a living god is not dependent on faith to maintain their existence; without it they will simply return to being a normal human.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Mountain of Faith]]'' [[Sanae Kochiya]]'s profile. "Though she didn't really have much faith, Sanae was able to live as a normal human without any real problems, but this would not do for the god she worshiped, Kanako.", as well other information on living gods&lt;/ref&gt; Many living gods originated as priestesses, who obtained faith from their gods' miracles being mistaken for their own.

===Half-youkai===
:''Main article: [[Half-youkai]]''
'''Half-youkai''' are beings who combine traits of both humans and [[youkai]].

===Hermits &amp; Celestials===
:''Main article: [[Hermit]]''
:''Main article: [[Celestial]]''
{{Nihongo|'''Hermits'''|仙人|sennin|literally "transcendent people" or "mountain people"}} are humans who have attained long life and otherworldly powers through spiritual training.&lt;br&gt; {{Nihongo|'''Celestials'''|天人|tennin|literally "heaven people"}} are a more powerful type of hermit who live in [[Heaven]], including both hermits who have earned a promotion and normal humans who have been transformed as a reward.

==Humans in Touhou==
[[File:HumansHM.jpg|thumb|260px|right|Several humans appear in the [[Human Village]] stage of [[Hopeless Masquerade]]]]
[[File:FS_children.png|thumb|100px|right|A couple of children shown in [[Forbidden Scrollery]].]]
In the [[Touhou Project]], humans from the land of [[Gensokyo]] are physically similar to humans in the [[Outside World|outside world]], but are remarkably different in terms of abilities and their dominance over land. In ancient times, brave humans, who knew how to deal with supernatural entities, traveled to a [[youkai]]-infested area that we now call Gensokyo. They settled there in order to watch the [[youkai]] and keep them from terrorizing the rest of the countryside. These capable humans battled the youkai often. One day, Gensokyo was sealed away from the rest of the world. Having been separated from the rest of humanity, Gensokyo humans have ignored scientific advances and developed formidable innate spiritual power to survive. Today, the normal Gensokyo human is probably a little more powerful than the average youkai, but the population of youkai greatly outnumbers humans. Most humans live in the [[Human Village]], but a few live in other notable locations.

Of course, there exist exceptional humans who can fight on equal terms against the most powerful beings in Gensokyo.

[[Magician]]s appear to be one of the species of youkai a human can become. It is unknown if magicians are specifically youkai human or a general class of youkai like the tengu who can originate from different species. All the magicians so far (Excluding [[Patchouli Knowledge]] who was born a magician) originate from a human. [[Therianthrope]]s and [[hermit]]s/[[celestial]]s appear to be the only other species originating from humans,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Lycaony]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Hermits]]''&lt;/ref&gt; though they might not be limited to humans. [[Lunarian]]s resemble human hermits and may or may not be a human subspecies.

In [[Sanae Kochiya]]'s senario in ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]'', [[Suwako Moriya]] differentiates between a human and an arahitogami.

The youkai of Gensokyo are not allowed to eat humans from Gensokyo under a recent contract, which may be the same as or related to the absolute unbreakable devil's contract resulting from the [[Perfect_Memento_in_Strict_Sense/Vampire|Vampire Incident]], as well as the [[spell card]] contract. This does not appear to stop them from making threats to do so. As [[ZUN%27s_reply_to_messages_on_the_former_Gensou_Bulletin_Board_3|ZUN has stated]] that these threats are akin to the taunts at the start of a pro-wrestling match, any threats to eat a human native to Gensokyo are presumably just posturing.

===Outsider===
The term "Outsider" refers to anyone from the [[Outside World]] who managed to get across the [[Hakurei Border]] and enter [[Gensokyo]]. Since youkai are rare in the Outside World (albeit not unheard of), most outsiders are human. Thus the term, "Outsider", typically refers to humans when used by natives of Gensokyo. 
While magic and other supernatural abilties are supposed to be almost extinct outside of Gensokyo, there are few exception like [[Sanae Kochiya]], [[Sumireko Usami]], and [[Maribel Hearn]] showing that some humans of the Outside World might still possess some kind of innate or aquired ability.

According to [[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]], Outsiders in Gensokyo are also referred to as "Spirited-Away" humans. It is stated in  [[Yukari Yakumo]]'s [[Perfect Cherry Blossom]] profile that outsiders generally end up in Gensokyo thanks to fluctuations in the border caused by her. Since the frequency of encountering them is considered to be "low", it might mean that outsiders don't end up in Gensokyo very often, but it could also be due to the fact that most of them get killed by youkai, reducing the potential number of outsiders effectively encounterable. The majority of outsiders that end up in Gensokyo seem to have little knowledge of technology (thus it seems that mechanics, computer programmers, and rocket scientists do not end up in Gensokyo very often). Because of this, any techology they bring into Gensokyo, such as mobile phones, can not be reproduced. However, outsiders still bring knowledge into Gensokyo that's otherwise unattainable, and thus are valued for that.

Unlike natives of Gensokyo, outsiders are not protected by the contract that came as a result of the Vampire Incident. In fact, the unbreakable devil's contract specifically stipulates that the [[vampire|vampires]] get outsiders to feed on in exchange for not attacking Gensokyo's native residents. Although Perfect Memento's wording implies the contract only applies to vampires, Yukari mentions to herself that "youkai may attack humans but do not eat them recklessly. Humans from the town are generally not for their eating under the contract" in [[Cage in Lunatic Runagate]] Chapter 5, showing the contract (or at least, a contract) extends to all youkai and prevents consumption, not attacking.

In addition, most outsiders do not realize youkai are youkai, with the exception of ghosts. This is possibly because most ghosts tend to not be as anthropomorphic as many of Gensokyo's youkai. The implication would be that to an outsider, a youkai looks just like a human with a funny hat or animal ears.

Unfortunately, these two factors results in many outsiders that end up in Gensokyo being eaten by youkai. Sometimes immediately, or sometimes after the youkai lose interest in them.

Sanctuary can be found in the Human Village or the Hakurei Shrine. At the Hakurei Shrine, outsiders may be returned to the normal world, or they rarely choose to stay in the village (though the number of outsiders choosing to stay has been increasing lately). It is not stated if they count as natives of Gensokyo protected by the contract after reaching the village, but it's possible, as Yukari stated "from the town", and an outsider that takes up residence in the village is technically "from the town" from then on. [[Sanae Kochiya]], being transported in along with [[Kanako Yasaka]] (and probably as well as being a living god), obviously was an exception to this.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1244">'''Humanoids''' ({{lang|ja|人間型}}, ''ningengata''; {{lang|ja|ヒューマノイド}}, ''hyuumanoido'') is a general term used to describe anything that is [[human]]-like anatomically. This would range from sister species like ''Homo neanderthalensis'' to mythological creatures like the Western [[vampire]]s. [[Robot]]s that are based off of humans are also referred to as humanoid machines.

==Humanoids in Touhou==
While this term has never been mentioned in the ''[[Touhou Project]]'', many [[youkai]] who do not possess a human-like body in the original folklore are given such qualities. While it cannot be said that this is a species in the ''Touhou Project'', it can be said that the term "human-like" has been used to describe species like [[magician]]s and [[tengu]], with the latter mimicking the humans of the [[outside world]].

"small person"}} are a species of tiny people in Japanese folklore, comparable to the English [[wikipedia:Tom Thumb|Tom Thumb]] or the [[wikipedia:Lilliput and Blefuscu|Lilliputians]] of ''Gulliver's Travels''. According to the "[[wikipedia:Izumo Province|Izumo]] Tradition", it is said that an inchling was part of creating the Japanese Islands along with Ōnamuji ([[wikipedia:Ōkuninushi|Ōkuninushi]]). The most famous inchling is {{nihongo|[[wikipedia:Issun-bōshi|Issun-boushi]]|一寸法師||"One-Inch Boy"}}, from whom the species derives its common English name.

==Inchling in Touhou==
An unknown number of inchlings live in the [[Shining Needle Castle]], including [[Shinmyoumaru Sukuna]], a princess descended from Issun-boushi himself. Inchlings are the only beings capable of wielding Issun-Boushi's [[Miracle Mallet]], though misuse of its power lead to the decline of their civilisation.

However, its true form is that of a desiccated, mummified dog’s head, often dressed up in ceremonial trappings, which is kept safe (and away from prying eyes) in a secret shrine in its owner’s house. The most common method to obtain an inugami is to restrain a hungry dog and place food where it is unable to reach. Once the dog tries to reach for the food, by cutting off it's head, it will become an inugami.  Inugami have much in common with other familiars, such as shikigami and kitsune-tsuki. Inugami are more commonly used in areas where foxes are not found, such as major population centers. There is even evidence of an ancient tradition of Inugami worship stretching from Western Japan down to Okinawa. Powerful sorcerers were said to be able to create these spirits through monstrous ceremonies and use them to all sorts of nefarious deeds. Inugami serve their masters loyally, performing tasks just like any faithful dog. They are loyal to one person or one family only, and unless seriously mistreated,they remain loyal to them forever; these spirits can be passed down from generation to generation like an heirloom. The technique for creating these fetishes was passed down along bloodlines, and such families are known as inugami-mochi. These families would keep their inugami hidden in the back rooms of their houses, under their beds, in dressers, or hidden among water jars.  It is said that a family owned as many inugami as there were members of the household, and when a new person joined the family, they too received their own familiar. Inugami were treated like family members by inugami-mochi families, and most of the time would quickly run out to do their master’s bidding any time their master wanted something. However, like living dogs, occasionally a resentful inugami might betray a master that grew too abusive or domineering, savagely biting him to death. And while inugami, like other familiar spirits, were created to bring wealth and prosperity to their families, occasionally they might also cause a family to fall into ruin. Inugami are also thought to possess their masters.

==Inugami in Touhou==
In ''[[Oriental Sacred Place]]'' chapter 16, a [[Unnamed Okuri-inu|wild yamainu]] may possibly have become an inugami if [[Kasen Ibaraki]] didn't interfere. Unlike the folklore, the inugami appear to be one of the outcomes of a yamainu becoming a youkai. It does so by attacking and devouring the flesh of a [[human]]. However like the mythology, it has the ability to possess humans.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2860">In Chinese folklore, '''jiang shi''' (Japanese: {{nihongo|キョンシー}}, ''Kyonshii''; {{zh|s=僵尸|t=殭屍|p=Jiāngshī|j=Goeng1 Si1|l=stiff corpse|links=no}}) are reanimated corpses that moves around by hopping with the arms outstreched. (It should be noted they have extremely limited movement due to [[wikipedia:rigor mortis|rigor mortis]].) They are often compared to [[vampire]]s because jiang shi attempt to suck qi, life energy, from the living, though they're actually more similar to zombies. Their weakness is unknown, and it is unknown how to properly exterminate one, though it is said that a person could hide his presence from a jiang shi by holding his breath. Jiang shi may be controlled by attaching a seal to the corpse.

In appearance, they have extremely pale white skin. They may look like someone who has died recently, or someone who has been deceased for a long time (rotting flesh, corpse decay).

==Jiang Shi in Touhou==
Jiang Shi are first mentioned in ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]'' by [[Hong Meiling]] asking whether [[Yuyuko Saigyouji]], a [[ghost]], is different from a jiang shi.&lt;ref&gt;[[Touhou Hisoutensoku|''Touhou Hisoutensoku'': Meiling's Script.]] "You're....different from a jiangshi, right?"&lt;/ref&gt;

Jiang shi are [[youkai]] of reanimated corpses and come in various varieties. When many Jiang Shi are seen at once, it means that they are [[human]]s who were bitten and transformed into them by another Jiang Shi. If a human does not receive life threating injuries when bitten, the zombification is only temporary; however fatal wounds will cause the victim to remain as a Jiang Shi.&lt;ref name="bou_n_1"&gt;''[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]]'': [[Symposium of Post-mysticism/Seiga Kaku|Seiga Kaku]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the jiang shi from Chinese folklore, the Touhou version is much like the Western [[zombie]]. In [[Yoshika Miyako]]'s profile it is known that they are a type of zombie which are reanimated corpses of another organism. Yoshika herself has self-proclaimed herself as a zombie in each scenerio.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ten Desires/Story/Reimu's Scenario|Ten Desires: Reimu's Scenario]] "Reimu: So you're a zombie?"&lt;br/&gt;"Yoshika: That's right, I'm a zombie."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ten Desires|''Ten Desires'': Yoshika Miyako - omake.txt]] "Her flesh body is very hard, and her joints do not bend. She cannot even walk that well. Her master is recommending an exercise training for flexibility. Activity with no flexibility often ends up in injury. Though she is just a zombie."&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1741">{{nihongo|'''Jinmenken'''|人面犬|human-faced dog}} are [[youkai]], specifically an [[urban legend]]. Stories date back to the [[wikipedia:Edo period|Edo period]], but the 1980s and 90s saw an increase in alleged sightings. 

Jinmenken are described as fur-covered and on all fours, but with a human face upon closer inspection. Often said to rummage through trash in alleyways, when approached, they will turn, revealing their face. They're even said to have the ability to speak, imploring you to leave them alone if bothered. They were sometimes thought to be an omen of disaster or even the cause of it. They are also said to be fast and they will chase or run alongside cars on the highway.

Most sightings of jinmenken have been proposed to be [[wikipedia:macaque|macaques]].

==Jinmenken in Touhou==
In ''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'', [[Kasen Ibaraki]] located an [[Minor Characters#Unnamed Jinmenken|Unnamed Jinmenken]] and brought it back to the [[Hakurei Shrine]], after it was sighted rummaging through a compost heap outside the [[Human Village]] by a resident.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'' chapter 26&lt;/ref&gt; Its personality is somewhat pathetic, merely begging to be left alone. [[Mamizou Futatsuiwa]] tells the group that it is an urban legend. Merely being a story told by children, its existence is particularly weak. It even vanished completely at one point, leaving behind its leash, only to be shown at the end of the chapter lounging underneath the Hakurei Shrine's porch. It was later referenced in ''[[Urban Legend in Limbo]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1914">[[File:FS_Jinyou.jpg|thumb|right|[[Unnamed Jinyou|The Fortune-teller]] in chapter 25 of ''[[Forbidden Scrollery]]'']]
{{nihongo|'''Jinyou'''|人妖|human youkai}} is a term for [[human]] inhabitants of [[Gensokyo]] who display [[youkai]] traits, or who willingly transform themselves into youkai.

==Jinyou in Touhou==
Becoming a jinyou is considered to pose a grave threat to the balance of Gensokyo, enough for [[Reimu Hakurei]] to call it "the greatest sin of all" and to actually kill jinyou rather than defeat them non-lethally like most youkai. The exact reason for this has not been explained, but may be related to jinyou learning secrets about Gensokyo to which the [[Human Village]] is not privy, to jinyou having different values from normal youkai, or to the risk of Gensokyo's youkai numbers becoming too great for its human population to sustain.

Exactly what constitutes a jinyou is unclear. A human can transform themselves into a [[magician]] youkai by using [[magic]] to suspend or replace their bodily functions, yet magicians do not seem to be considered inherently dangerous. It may be that jinyou use more foul or taboo transformation methods than magicians (the jinyou who appears in ''[[Forbidden Scrollery]]'' being essentially a stabilised [[vengeful spirit]]), that becoming a magician - which requires decades of study - is too difficult to appeal to large numbers of humans, or simply that there are no magician youkai originating from the Human Village. Likewise a number of major characters (including [[Sakuya Izayoi]], and even Reimu herself) have been described as "youkai-like humans" at times, but it is unclear if they fall under this definition, particularly since few of them live in the village.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4542">[[File:WnHH Kappa.png|thumb|The group of Kappa appearing throughout ''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'', including [[Nitori Kawashiro]]]]
{{nihongo|'''Kappa'''|河童||"river-child"}} are a type of [[youkai]] that live in rivers, broadly similar to aquatic goblins. Often portrayed as having a turtle shell and beak, they're known for their curiosity towards [[human]]s, sometimes challenging them to tests of skill, though they are also known to eat children. They have a unique dish-like structure on their heads, which must remain filled with water for them to move around on land; the easiest way to defeat a kappa is to bow to it, obligating it to return the bow and spill the contents of its dish. All kappa are extremely fond of cucumbers, and cucumbers are the most common offerings given to them. Kappa are known to extract {{nihongo|shirikodama|尻子玉||"anal ball"}} from humans (an imaginary gland said to reside somewhere around the anus or stomach), killing them in the process - this story seems to originate from the tendency of drowned corpses to have their anus wide open as if something were pulled out from there. Kappa are sometimes depicted with superhuman strength, easily outmatching humans at sumo wrestling as long as they play fair.

==Kappa in Touhou==
[[File:WaHHKappa.png|thumb|220px|right|A group of Kappa in [[Genbu Ravine]]]]
The kappa in [[Gensokyo]] (or at least the ones shown so far) wear mostly variations on a blue hiker-style outfit, with a backpack and hat standing in for their mythical shell and dish. Kappa live mostly around the base of [[Youkai Mountain]].

Kappa in Gensokyo seem to think they're on good terms with humans, but some of the folklore humans handed down over the generations suggest that humans think otherwise. Around the time the [[Great Hakurei Barrier]] was formed, the kappa constructed the [[Dragon (God)|Dragon]] statue in the [[Human Village]], secretly incorporating a weather prediction device into its eyes. According to [[Marisa Kirisame]], all kappa are geniuses at the things they care about, but (perhaps because of this) they don't work well in groups. Due to this and their fickle nature as [[youkai]], despite their technological genius, they are ill-suited for long-term construction projects, as shown in ''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'' when they continually blew up the dam they were trying to build.

According to [[Rinnosuke Morichika]] in [[Curiosities of Lotus Asia/Chapter_18|''Curiosities of Lotus Asia'' Chapter 18]], the true form of the kappa are the softshell [[turtle]]s that live in rivers and ponds, and when these turtles live for too long, they gain supernatural abilities and become kappa. As much of Rinnosuke's speculation is grossly inaccurate, it is unknown whether this is true.

In ''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'' Chapter 22 it is revealed that kappa consume blood and shirikodama as a remedy for salt deficiencies. Upon learning that the sea consists of saltwater, [[Nitori]] claims that this would remove the need for such supplements, implying that kappa may have originally been a sea-dwelling species.

Based on what [[Hieda no Akyuu]] says about Nitori in ''[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]]'', it seems like manipulating water is a general ability that all kappa share. Although the true extent of this ability is unknown, in one occasion a kappa went mad by staring at [[Clownpiece]]'s torch and was able to throw an entire river worth of water in the sky after shaping the liquid mass in the form of a [[dragon]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Visionary Fairies in Shrine]] - Chapter 11.5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Yamawaro==
{{nihongo|Yamawaro|山童||"mountain child"}} are a type of kappa who have migrated away from the river. In [[Wild and Horned Hermit]] chapter 13, it was revealed that their numbers increased after [[Genbu Ravine]] was made temporarily uninhabitable by the [[kishin]] chief Suiki.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1253">The '''Kasha''' ({{lang|ja|火車}}, ''kasha'') is a [[demon]] with a feline form who would swoop down in a sudden gale, which would grow in intensity until it whisked away the casket of the deceased to carry them off to Hell or devour them. This happened during the funeral before cremation and caused much anger and mortification among those at the funeral, for legened stated that the person being carried away had committed a large number of sins during their life.

The legend of the Kasha was not limited to funerals, however. Some stories tell of seemingly ordinary days where an elderly woman who is especially hated by everyone announces that she is going to an outside lavatory and upon stepping outside would be carried away by a huge black cloud into the sky. But this cloud is also at times referred to as Mouryou, another beast from Japanese folklore. It seems that the "mouryou" and "kasha" were thought of as the same class of demon.

Originally the Kasha would appear from time in Buddhism texts as "Ingakiyou".

Katawa-guruma inflict powerful curses on anyone who sees it, and the curse can spread through rumor and gossip about said curse, which can eventually bring calamity onto the entire village. Despite this, Katawa-guruma have been known to show mercy at times unlike their male counterparts.

They are never late for anything and they are considered to be wise, careful creatures. The pattern on their body is depicted to be fire. They are often incorrectly defined as a unicorn and are more closer to a chimera like the [[Nue (Species)|Nue]].

In Japan, the term is most commonly used for the animal known as a giraffe which resembles the same creature and was mistaken as such when it was first brought to China where the Japanese borrowed the kanji from.

'''Kitsune''' ({{lang|ja|狐}}) is the Japanese word for fox. Before the term was used for every other fox species around the world, the term kitsune would likely be used for ''Vulpes vulpes japonica'' (Japanese fox) and ''Vulpes vulpes schrencki'' (Hokkaido fox), two subspecies of the red fox.

In Japanese folklore, [[youkai]] kitsune ({{lang|ja|妖狐}}, "Youko") are believed to possess great intelligence, long life, and magical powers. One of the more notable features of the kitsune are their numerous tails; they may possess as many as nine.  The more tails a kitsune has, the older and more powerful he or she is, for every one hundred years they live, another tail grows. Once they have lived for eight hundred years they will have nine tails, one of them the one they were born with, and the other eight grown through the ages.  A kitsune's greatest power is that of illusion; they are able to trick a human into seeing almost anything. Because of this ability, they are regarded as playful tricksters in many stories.

Some legends say that once a person has won the trust of a kitsune, it will be difficult for others to convince that kitsune otherwise.  They are extremely loyal to those they trust, and would often do anything for those people.

==Kitsune in Touhou==
Monster foxes ({{lang|ja|化け狐}}, "Bakegitsune") is generic term for foxes that became youkai. Specific species of fox youkai also exist like the [[kuda-gitsune‎]]. However from what [[Kasen Ibaraki]] says, the kuda-gitsune may not be classified as a normal youkai fox as it can biologically breed if a male and female are present, making it a pure species of youkai.

{{Nihongo|'''Kuda-gitsune'''|管狐|pipe fox}} is a species of [[youkai]]  [[kitsune|fox]]. The fox is supposedly kept  in a bamboo pipe as pets.

==Kuda-gitsune in Touhou==
[[File:WaHHKudagitsunePair.png|thumb|A male-female pair of kuda-gitsune‎ depicted by [[Kasen Ibaraki]] in ''Wild and Horned Hermit'' chapter 8.]]
It was first introduced into the series as a species of [[kitsune|youkai fox]] in ''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'' chapter 8.

Kuda-gitsune have the ability to possesses [[human]]s and control their minds, and can additionally disappear at will. They are used by practitioners to make money for them, but in using their powers, kuda-gitsune devour the practicioner's own vitality and wealth. Moreover, these foxes are gluttonous youkai that will only eat gourmet food and will not work if hungry.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'': [[Wild and Horned Hermit#Chapter Eight|Chapter 8]] &amp;mdash; ''Kasen: "Tube foxes serve human spellcasters and work to bring about wealth. They can possess humans and manipulate them at will, or gather both trinkets and fortunes without restriction."''&lt;/ref&gt;

They can be kept in bamboo tubes, but they must be kept in a male-female pair. This has a great disadvantage, however, since doing so will increase the number of foxes, their consumption levels greatly increase, inevitably devouring all of the practitioner's vitality and wealth in the process.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'': [[Wild and Horned Hermit#Chapter Eight|Chapter 8]] &amp;mdash; ''Kasen: "Kuda-gitsune‎ are normally kept in bamboo tubes, but must be kept in a male-female pair. Doing so will increase their numbers, thus increasing their food requirements, inevitably devouring all of the practitioner's vitality and wealth in the process."''&lt;/ref&gt;

The increase of foxes due to keeping a male-female pair may possibly be the only known reproduction in [[youkai]]. However, because [[Kasen Ibaraki]] only stated that "Doing so will increase their numbers", it can only be assumed as normal biological reproduction.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1030">The '''Lampads''' or "Lampades" (Greek: Λαμπάδες) are the nymphs of the Underworld in Greek mythology. Companions of Hecate, the goddess of witchcraft and crossroads, they were a gift from Zeus for Hecate's loyalty in the Titanomachy. They carry torches and accompany Hecate on her night-time travels and hauntings. According to some legends, the light of the Lampads' torches can drive one to madness.

==Lampads in Touhou==
In Touhou, lampads like [[Clownpiece]] seem to be considered a type of [[fairy]]. They inhabit [[Hell]], and are servants of [[Hecatia Lapislazuli]], a [[god|goddess]] of Hell who is herself based on Hecate. Like the creatures they are based on, Touhou's lampads have the power to drive people insane with their torches.&lt;ref&gt;[[Strange Creators of Outer World/Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom interview with ZUN]] - Clownpiece section&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{nihongo|'''Lunarians'''|月人|tsukibito|lit. "moon people"}}, also {{nihongo|月の民||Tsuki no Tami|lit. "people of the moon"}} are the people living on or coming from the [[Moon]]. The term refers to a specific species, but more specifically refers to the people who humans and gods that ascended from the Earth and took control of the moon. This does not include moon rabbits.

==Lunarians in Touhou==
Thousands of years ago, the original Lunarians consisting of [[Lord Tsukuyomi]] and his most trusted relatives, including the older [[Eirin Yagokoro]], came from the Earth to the moon. They were able to do so because they had the revelation that the world was built on probabilities and anything could happen, allowing them to artificially increase the probability that living beings on Earth would find their way to the Moon. &lt;ref&gt;[[Cage in Lunatic Runagate]]: [[Cage in Lunatic Runagate/Third Chapter|Third Chapter]] — "The Lunarians had long ago realized that our world is built on probabilities, that absolutely anything can happen. That was what enabled them to move from the Earth to the moon in the first place."&lt;/ref&gt; Their reason was to leave the [[impurity]] that was ravaging the land. &lt;ref&gt;[[Cage in Lunatic Runagate]]: [[Cage in Lunatic Runagate/Third Chapter|Third Chapter]] — "Lord Tsukuyomi took only relatives he had the utmost trust in and moved to the moon." and related text around it.&lt;/ref&gt; It somewhat implied that the original Lunarians were [[human]], as the Lunarians resemble humans in most ways to the point where they can live as humans (functionally speaking) on Earth&lt;ref&gt;[[Cage in Lunatic Runagate]]: [[Cage in Lunatic Runagate/First Chapter|First Chapter]] - "I decided I would atone for my sin by helping find a place on Earth where she could live an easy life as a human."&lt;/ref&gt;, and are classified as human in ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'' (however, the author [[Hieda no Akyu]] does not seem to be aware of the extraterrestrial origins of the people being classified as such). However, Lunarians are closer in nature to [[hermit]]s or [[celestial]]s than normal humans.&lt;ref&gt;[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]]: [[Symposium of Post-mysticism/Interview|ZUN interview]]&lt;/ref&gt; They naturally live much longer lives, and are even said to live forever; they are not true immortals, however, and may die eventually due to unnatural causes such as accidents or battles. &lt;ref&gt;[[Cage in Lunatic Runagate]]: [[Cage in Lunatic Runagate/Third Chapter|Third Chapter]] — "Of course, since the lunar citizens and the moon rabbits aren't immortal, they can die in, for example, accidents or battles. Still, even the citizens of the lunar capital bear just the faintest trace of impurity. Even we may be fated to die some day."&lt;/ref&gt; Lunarians also allegedly have superhuman stamina and abilities beyond even [[youkai]] of the Earth, and possess some of the most advanced technology that there is. &lt;ref&gt;[[Cage in Lunatic Runagate]]: [[Cage in Lunatic Runagate/Fourth Chapter|Fourth Chapter]] — "The Lunarians possess highly advanced technology, unyielding stamina and abilities that are far outmatch those of youkai."&lt;/ref&gt;

Supposedly, according to [[Kaguya Houraisan]], the Lunarians not only are the originators of most powers on Earth, but also turned some earthlings into monsters in order to regulate the Earth's impurity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Imperishable Night]]: [[Imperishable Night/Story/Scarlet Team's Scenario 2|Scarlet Team's Scenario]] — "The moon granted many powers to the Earth. Most powers such as magic were originally those of the moon". "We of the moon turned some on the Earth into monsters, to regulate the Earthlings' impurity."&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Yukari Yakumo]] has an alternate origin of youkai, saying in narrative to herself that it was the moon's dim light which gave birth to the youkai in a manner of speaking, by causing humanity to fear and create legends about them. &lt;ref&gt;[[Cage in Lunatic Runagate]]: [[Cage in Lunatic Runagate/Fifth Chapter|Fifth Chapter]] — "Under the dim light of the moon, all sorts of things blanket the Earth in shadows, such as grasses, trees, mountains, rocks and buildings. With light as weak as moonlight, it is impossible to eliminate these shadows. And they are the birthplace of humanity's fears, sometimes creating legends of youkai. In a manner of speaking, the moon gave birth to all youkai."&lt;/ref&gt; The two explanations are not entirely mutually exclusive, and may be a result of differing outlooks or parts on the matter. For example, the Lunarians may have purposefully dimmed the moon's light to make humanity's fears create the youkai.

The Lunar Capital appears to have a mix of Chinese and Japanese architecture and dress styles, but the extent of the connection between Lunarians and these cultures is unknown.

"sorcerous woman"}} usually refer to [[human]]s who are supposedly capable of using magic. Originally the character {{nihongo||魔|ma}} referred to dark arts, demons and those who trafficked with them, but in modern times it can also refer to any kind of Western-style magic, good or evil.

==Magicians in Touhou==

===Youkai Magicians===
In Touhou, "magician" is both a profession and a species of [[youkai]]. Any [[human]] magician can become a magician youkai by researching magic that takes away their need for food, but some magician youkai are born in this state naturally. Regardless of origin a magician youkai's body is essentially human, and they do not possess the enhanced physical strength and durability of most youkai.&lt;ref&gt;[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Magician]]&lt;/ref&gt; In fact many magician youkai are frail even by human standards, due to lack of exercise and exposure to toxic magical reagents such as [[wikipedia:Arsenic|arsenic]] and [[wikipedia:Mercury (element)|mercury]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'': Chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt; Magician youkai are considered "complete" when they learn how to halt their own aging processes through magic, a feat which past magicians could only achieve by the time they were already old and grey, but which has become easier and easier as magical knowledge has advanced.

A magician youkai can also come into being when an ordinary object is filled with sufficient magical power, in which case they are described as being like [[wikipedia:Golem|golems]]. [[Narumi Yatadera]] is once such case, being originally a Jizo statue that was brought to life by the intense power of the [[Forest of Magic]]. This type of magician can be considered somewhat similar to [[Tsukumogami|tsukumogami]] in that they are an object brought to life - however, their power comes from magic, rather than the restlessness of their spirit.

[[ZUN]] has stated that magicians and [[vampire]]s are basically like [[devil]]s,&lt;ref name="Shofu6"&gt;[[ZUN's former blog "Touhou Shofu" 6]]&lt;/ref&gt; it could be said that they are in general simply another name for [[demon]]s.

===Magicians and Magic===
Magicians, both human and youkai, are extremely flexible in their use of [[youjutsu|spiritual power]]. While most beings are limited to using the powers they are born with, in theory a magician can create almost any effect as long as they understand how it works and can construct a suitable spell for it. They are, however, at least partially reliant on outside sources of magical energy such as the mushrooms from the [[Forest of Magic]]. The type of energy is also important - [[Marisa]] notes that ice magic is simple in winter, but difficult in summer without a strongly ice-associated item like Water Dragon scales.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Forbidden Scrollery]]'': Chapter 14&lt;/ref&gt; Many magicians have one type of magic which they are particularly skilled at or fond of, such as [[Alice]]'s use of dolls or [[Byakuren]]'s focus on bodily enhancement. A magician's home is usually filled with books, notes and artifacts, due to the amount of studying and work required to learn any type of spell; because of this they are generally seen as indoor-loving, bookish types of people.

According to [[Curiosities of Lotus Asia/Chapter 18|Chapter 18]] of ''[[Curiosities of Lotus Asia]]'', magic has six components:
* The caster's level of {{nihongo|'''Ability'''|技量|giryou}}
* The {{nihongo|'''Temperament'''|気質|katagi}} of the soul
* The {{nihongo|'''Substance'''|物質|busshitsu}} of the materials and tools
* The {{nihongo|'''Space'''|空間|kuukan}} in which it takes place
* The {{nihongo|'''Time'''|時間|jikan}} at which it is performed
* {{nihongo|'''Fortune'''|運|un}}, the most important element, which can compensate for deficiencies in the other five

Magicians as a profession are very similar to [[scientist]]s and researchers in the real world, to the point where [[Patchouli Knowledge]] refers to magic and science as the same thing.&lt;ref&gt;[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]: [[Touhou Hisoutensoku/Translation/Patchouli's Script|Patchouli Knowledge's win quotes]] — "The essence of magic is to determine the root cause of all things. There's no distinction between science and magic." "The magic outside sure has advanced. There are too few researchers in Gensokyo." "Tengu are the magician types. They're the same in seeking the truth." "The power of magic is like those of science. Meaning, it's at the forefront of the times!"&lt;/ref&gt; Mastery of both requires extensive knowledge and research into the true laws of the world, and magicians collect data and build upon the research of others just like all scientific researchers do; magic is not something that just happens randomly, any more than gravity or electricity.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Silent Sinner in Blue]]'': Chapter 6 — "It is the pride of us magicians to be able to respect and preserve the original while adding our own bit of originality."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[The Grimoire of Marisa]]: [[The Grimoire of Marisa/Foreword|Foreword]] — "Research can't start without a thought process. Listing and organizing is important, but to make it worthwhile to oneself requires thought."&lt;/ref&gt; For example Marisa is stated to spend a lot of time picking mushrooms, mixing and heating them in different combinations, and recording the effects. Patchouli spends almost all of her time reading and writing books. The fight with Alice in ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]'' comes while Alice is experimenting with a new doll enlargement spell.

==Additional Information==
*In addition to Patchouli's remark that science and magic are the same, [[ZUN]] himself states in ''[[Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red]]'''s music column that the song, "Merry the Magician", is meant to have a science-ish feel to it. A song about a magician yet meant to have a science feel seems to imply that Patchouli's analogy of magic and science is mostly accurate.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1129">A {{nihongo|'''menreiki'''|面霊気||roughly "mask essence"}} is a type of [[youkai]] in Japanese folklore, composed of [[wikipedia:Gigaku|Gigaku]] masks. 

==Menreiki in Touhou==
In the ''[[Touhou Project]]'', menreiki are more akin to the collective [[tsukumogami]] of a mask. There isn't much information on their powers, exceptional strengths, or ways to defeat them. The only example of a menreiki in [[Gensokyo]] is [[Hata no Kokoro]], the tsukumogami of a set of masks once created by [[Toyosatomimi no Miko]]. Being recently born, there isn't much known about her beyond what's revealed in ''[[Hopeless Masquerade]]''. Her masks were her way of expressing and possessing emotions and if she loses even one, there's the risk of the others going out of control; the main plot of ''Hopeless Masquerade'' centers on this. She appears innately skillful in various [[wikipedia:Noh|Noh]] plays.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="862">{{nihongo|'''Mermaids'''|人魚|ningyo|lit. "human-fish"}} are traditionally more monstrous in Japanese folklore than most sources, having the upper bodies of monkeys rather than humans, or even just a human face on a fish body. A beached mermaid is an omen of disaster, while eating the flesh of a mermaid is said to grant long life or immortality.

==Mermaids in Touhou==
The mermaid race in Gensokyo appear to have been shaped by both native and foreign concepts, with the only known example having a human upper body and fish-fin ears. It is unknown whether monstrous mermaids also exist.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1799">{{nihongo|'''Namazu'''|ナマズ||lit. "catfish"}} is the Japanese name for all fish in the order ''Siluriformes'' also known as catfish. Catfish are a diverse group of ray-finned fish that spread throughout most of the world. All catfish have no scales, although some groups of catfish have bony plates called scutes. 

Before scientific classifications of animals worldwide, the namazu is most likely the name specifically for ''Silurus asotus''.&lt;ref name="bou_n_1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planetcatfish.com/catelog/species.php?species_id=78|title=Silurus asotus • Siluridae • Cat-eLog • PlanetCatfish • PlanetCatfish.com|accessdate=19 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Japanese folklore, catfish are often associated with earthquakes due to how they react and large catfish are thought to have the ability to cause earthquakes.

==Namazu in Touhou==
In ''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'' chapter 17, when [[Marisa Kirisame]] tells [[Sanae Kochiya]] that she saw an electric beast, one of Sanae assumptions is that Marisa might have been talking about a namazu. It can be assumed that she is referring to the [[Wikipedia:Electric Catfish|electric catfish]] as the other fish mentioned being an eel ([[Wikipedia:Electric Eel|electric eel]]).&lt;ref name="bou_n_2"&gt;''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'': Chapter 6 — Sanae: "An electric beast... Your not referring to an eel or a catfish right; an electric mouse...?"&lt;/ref&gt; This likely indicates that the term namazu is used to describe all catfish species, or at least in the [[outside world]].

According to legend, if you're out at midnight, the night sparrow will follow you while singing "Chin Chin." The appearance of a night sparrow is a prodigious sign that you will meet a wolf/stray dog soon. Legend also has it that if you catch the night sparrow, you'll suffer from severe night-blindness.

==Nue in Touhou==
The different variants of the nue belong to one individual known as [[Nue Houjuu]]. This implies that Nue may be the only one of her kind or they are an extremely rare species of [[youkai]].

Due to the depths of which this fish lives, oarfish are rarely seen but do wash up on beaches as dead carcasses. Explained in science, it is possible that oarfish are the first victims from the effects of a pre-earthquake causing it to surface in a dead state before it hits the land.

In folklore these fish are known as the messenger of the Dragon Palace ({{lang|ja|龍宮}}, ryūgū). Whenever these fish are caught in nets or washed up dead on beaches, it is said that earthquakes will occur.

==Oarfish in Touhou==
The oarfish is familiar in terms of basic knowledge with the experienced residents of [[Gensokyo]] and the ones that lived in the [[outside world]] at some point. Because oceans are not present in Gensokyo, it can be assumed that oarfish are not found wild in its animal form.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4710">{{nihongo|'''Oni'''|鬼}} are fabulous creatures from Japanese folklore, similar to Western [[demon]]s or ogres. They're almost always depicted as beings with incredible strength and power; physically, two long horns are said to grow from their heads. The earliest folktales of oni generally described them as benevolent creatures able to ward off evil and punish the wicked, but over time, oni began to be seen as cruel, malevolent creatures, content only to destroy. "Oni" in Japanese is sometimes used non-literally to describe beings of similar cruelty, such as {{nihongo|[[vampire]]s|吸血鬼|kyūketsuki|literally "blood-sucking oni"}}.

{{nihongo|'''Kishin'''|鬼神}} is a Japanese word combining the characters for {{nihongo|"oni"|鬼}} and {{nihongo|"god"|神}}. It usually refers to a [[wikipedia:fierce deities|wrathful deity]], a type of divine being in Buddhism or to an exceptionally powerful oni. 

==Oni in Touhou==
In ''[[Touhou Project]]'', oni are jolly youkai who love to drink, feast, and compete with [[human]]s in any kind of contest, from simple physical fighting to drinking games. Long ago, when an oni found a human that they liked, they tempted that human into challenging them in any way the human desired. Should the human lose, they were to be abducted. Because normal humans were nowhere near an oni's capabilities, they mostly resorted to sneaky underhanded tactics in order to beat the oni. Tired of being tricked and beaten all the time, the oni swore off humans forever and left for a place beyond human reach, or so the legend says.

In [[Gensokyo]], oni were once the main residents of the [[Youkai Mountain]], and were above [[tengu]] and [[kappa]] in the hierarchy. They were led by the [[Big Four of the Mountain]]. However, they eventually moved into [[Former Hell]] sometime after the actual [[Hell]] was moved away from the [[Underworld]] by the [[yama]]. In Hell, oni are lead by the kishin to torture the souls of sinners.

[[Komachi Onozuka]] mentions that the oni of current Hell are under control and the ones of [[Former Hell]] have too many close relationships with the ghosts of sinners, making them not fond of the idea of leaving to the real Hell anytime soon. 

;Characteristics
With their high level of physical strength and magical power, oni are considered among the strongest beings in Gensokyo. Moreover, they differ from regular [[youkai]] and the means and tools used to exterminate them are also different. Since oni have disappeared for a long time, there are no specialists in oni extermination in Gensokyo, and the methods to deal with them have been lost to humans. Because of this, meeting an oni in the current times would spell disaster for most.

In ''[[The Grimoire of Marisa]]'' and ''[[Double Spoiler]]'', it's shown that some of the spell cards of oni are unique, barely being able to be considered [[danmaku]] at all. According to [[Patchouli Knowledge]] and [[Yuugi Hoshiguma]], oni can be weakened by fried soy beans. [[Hieda no Akyuu]] claims that running a holly branch through a sardine head would prevent an oni from approaching, but it's unknown if that would really work.

==Kishin in Touhou==
In ''[[Touhou Project]]'', kishin are powerful youkai who reside in [[Hell]]. Each kishin chief commands a number of lesser oni in their torment of the souls who fall into Hell, utilizing a wide array of torture devices. When a [[Hermit|hermit]] or [[Celestial|celestial]] has lived too long, a kishin chief is sent to assassinate them, though most of the living believe that the [[assassin]] is a [[shinigami]] due to misinformation they have spread. According to [[Hecatia]] in ''[[Alternative Facts in Eastern Utopia/Article and Interview/Clownpiece and Hecatia Lapislazuli|Alternative Facts in Eastern Utopia]]'', there are kishin at the top of the [[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Yama#The_Ministry_of_Right_and_Wrong|organization]] of [[Hell]] that work with [[yama]]. It is unknown if these elite kishin are of the same type of kishin that manage Hell's oni or if they are [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] [[wikipedia:Wrathful deity|wrathful deities]]

{{nihongo|'''Phantom'''|幽霊|yuurei|lit. "faint spirit" or "dim spirit"}} refers to ghostly beings in Japanese folklore. A more general term encompassing phantoms is {{nihongo||お化け|obake}}. Note that while they have concrete meanings in Touhou, in standard Japanese the difference between the terms {{nihongo||幽霊|yuurei}} and [[Ghost|{{nihongo||亡霊|bourei}}]] is not well-defined.

==Types of phantom==
===Phantom===
{{nihongo|'''Phantoms'''|幽霊|yuurei}} are the "standard" ghostly spirits which exist in both the living world and the various afterlife realms, which take the form of semi-tangible wisps similar in appearance to [[divine spirit]]s and [[evil spirit]]s. Phantoms include spirits of the deceased but can be born from humans who are not dead, non-human beings and even inanimate objects, and a single source can produce multiple phantoms; telling where a particular phantom came from is more or less impossible. Phantoms are cold to the touch, and a group of phantoms can reduce the surrounding temperature to freezing levels. A phantom who embodies a particular emotion will impress it on other beings around them, though for most phantoms the effects are not significant. Phantoms can also possess humans when their mental defences are low, causing their emotions to be affected until they receive an exorcism.

===Ship Phantom===
{{nihongo|'''Ship phantoms'''|船幽霊|funayuurei}} are ghosts of those who have drowned at sea. They use their ladles to sink boats.

===Half-phantom===
{{nihongo|'''Half-phantoms'''|半人半霊|hannin hanrei|half-human half-phantom}} are a subspecies of phantom described as the "half-breeds" of phantom and human, who are neither truly alive nor dead (and can be considered a type of [[half-youkai]]). The only known half-phantoms are the members of the Konpaku family - [[Youmu Konpaku]] and [[Youki Konpaku]]. An individual of this species has two bodies, one resembling a human and the other resembling a phantom of above-average size. Their human half's body temperature is colder than that of normal humans, while the phantom half's body temperature is warmer than that of normal phantoms. [[Youmu]] claims that it is harder to detect their presence than that of either parent species. While they appear to be born and die like normal humans, their unusual nature results in a greatly extended lifespan. Members of this species lack two of the ten desires possessed by most beings ("attachment to life" and "envy of death"), making [[Toyosatomimi no Miko]]'s ability less effective against them.

===Ghost===
:''Main article: [[Ghost]]''
{{nihongo|'''Ghosts'''|亡霊|bourei}} are corporeal spirits of the deceased, easily mistaken for living humans.

===Dream Soul===
{{nihongo|'''Dream souls'''|夢魂|mukon}} are physical manifestations of dreams. Under unusual circumstances a dream soul can exist outside of a person, in which case it takes on a form resembling a soap bubble (with nightmares being darker in colour than pleasant dreams). While it can pass through physical objects, a dream soul that comes in contact with a person will burst and transmit its dream to them, usually knocking them asleep in the process (or expelling their own dream soul, if they were already dreaming). It is possible to ensure pleasant dreams by sleeping with an object that contains pleasant dream souls under your pillow.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'' chapter 29&lt;/ref&gt; [[Doremy Sweet]] carries a pink blob which ZUN has described as a dream soul.&lt;ref&gt;''Strange Creators of Outer World'' vol. 1: [[Strange Creators of Outer World/Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom interview with ZUN|Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom interview with ZUN]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Being dead, one might think that they no longer have any need for food, sleep, physical pain, or other inconveniences of the living condition. Whether any of that is true is currently unknown. What we know is that they like to party, eat, behave cryptically, continue doing the same activities they enjoyed in life, and generally have a good time, but this usually due to the denial of being dead.

Although phantoms and [[poltergeist]]s are usually thought of as same species, in actuality they are not, according to [[ZUN]].

Within the safely guarded borders of the [[Netherworld]], the phantoms live out the days of their afterlives pursuing whatever happens to come to mind. There are some vague hints about a chain of command that even the dead must follow, but it doesn't seem like specific details have been worked out. Phantoms are easily distracted.

The downside on being a phantom seems to be not having a real body. In fact, phantoms seem to be able to drink and eat because they're able to touch objects but they never have a feeling of satisfaction on it. But it still isn't obvious.

They appear to be quite common around [[Gensokyo]]. You can capture a phantom by sealing it within a jar or using a sotoba to attract it.

As [[Aya]] notes in ''[[Double Spoiler]]'', boat usage in [[Gensokyo]] is very limited making spirits like ship phantoms unable to use their ship sinking abilities. She does mention that the [[Sanzu River]] may have many boats ready for sinkage.

==Phantoms in Seihou==
In the ''[[Seihou Project]]'', phantoms have been shown to exist in the [[Seihou World|world of Seihou]]. [[Yuitia]], currently the only example, died in an accident near Mars where her sleeping soul hasn't notice her own death and continued to wander around, eventually making her turn into a phantom. Whether phantoms in the ''Seihou Project'' follows the same scheme of how phantoms work in the ''Touhou Project'' is unknown.

==Phantom's Appearances==
[[File:Th11EvilSpirits.png|frame|right|Sprite of phantoms in various games]]
===Windows===
Phantoms (may also be referred to as [[spirit]]s or other form of ghostly figure as there have been no official identification) appeared in ''[[Double Dealing Character]]'' and ''[[Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom]]'' as general [[stage enemies]]. Like other enemies, they'll shoot [[danmaku]] at the player character and the type and amount they shoot can depend on the game, stage and difficulty. Despite their exact design, they are not to be confused with [[vengeful spirit]]s and [[divine spirit]]s who are from ''[[Subterranean Animism]]'' and ''[[Ten Desires]]'' respectively; various indications suggests that the spirits in these two games are not the same.

{{Nihongo|'''Plants'''|植物|, shokubutsu}} are organisms scientifically belonging to the ''Plantae'' kingdom. Unlike the organisms from the ''[[Animal|Animalia]]'' kingdom, plants cannot move on their own and rely on food being brought to them one way or another. Plants generally support almost all terrestrial life on earth and play one of the most important roles in the food chain.

==Plants in Touhou==
Various species of plants are seen or mentioned primarily throughout the print works and occasionally in-game. Plants appear to be a rather common food source among [[human]]s and [[youkai]] alike during normal basis in ''Touhou Sangetsusei''.

==Plants in Seihou==
In the ''[[Seihou Project]]'', all plants on [[Seihou World#Earth|Earth]] went to extinction. The only known plant to still exist was the {{nihongo|''[[wikipedia:Cactus|cactus (''Cactaceae'')]]''|サボテン|saboten}}, where the [[Cactus Company]] managed to extract energy from it (called [[cactus energy]]) for [[human]]ity to continue. Although this is the case, grass and a few trees were still shown to exist throughout the games. The [[Seihou World#Silk Road|Silk Road]] (that may have possibilities to have an official connection with the ''[[Touhou Project]]'') was shown to have many plants in the background of the Extra stage of ''[[Shuusou Gyoku]]''.

==Additional Information==
*A copy of [[wikipedia:Voynich manuscript|Voynich manuscript]] was seen in ''[[Oriental Sacred Place]]'' chapter 15, depicting a section on plants.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2650">A '''poltergeist''' ({{lang|ja|ポルターガイスト}} or {{lang|ja|騒霊}}, ''sourei'') is a [[wikipedia:Paranormal|paranormal]] [[wikipedia:Phenomenon|phenomenon]] where objects appear to have moved or been thrown without anything touching them. In believes, they may be ghosts or [[spirit]]s controlling the movement, where as science is unable to explain such energy due to the cases been widely rare.

==Poltergeists in Touhou==
In the ''[[Touhou Project]]'', poltergeist are very similar to a [[Phantom]], and is often seen announcing its presence by introducing disorder. They are described as essentially being [[phantom]]s that are able to make noise, hence the name ''sourei'' (noise spirit).&lt;ref name="pmiss"&gt;[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]] - [[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Lunasa Prismriver|Lunasa Prismriver's article]]&lt;/ref&gt; They are able to remotely manipulate objects. They can also manifest themselves visibly, audibly and solidly to the material world (it is assumed that not all ghost-like beings have such an ability).

The noises that poltergeists make are actually the phantoms of musical notes, rather than physical ones. Because of this, spirits, which don't have a body, or physical ears to hear with, can also "enjoy" music made by poltergeists.&lt;ref name="pmiss"/&gt;

Poltergeists seem to have a talent for discovering and causing the kind of interference that will raise the greatest commotion in any sane situation. Speculatively speaking, their talent with interference potential may be what allowed the Prismriver sisters to become famous as the Phantom Ensemble. They make music that strikes all the right nerves in the audience.

Although ghosts and poltergeists are usually thought of as same species, in actuality they are not, according to [[ZUN]]. This is probably because poltergeists in Touhou (the [[Prismriver Sisters]] in particular) aren't spirits of the dead, but constructs based on [[Layla Prismriver]]'s power.

Poltergeists have no life span making them immortal in the sense that they won't naturally die from old age.&lt;ref&gt;[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View/Story/Komachi's Script|''Phantasmagoria of Flower View'': VS Mode]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cage in Lunatic Runagate CH62.jpg | thumb | Moon rabbits]]
[[File:Moon rabbit citizens.jpg | thumb | Moon rabbit citizens from SSiB chapter 7]]

In the [[Touhou Project]], {{nihongo|'''Rabbits'''|兎|usagi}} living in [[Gensokyo]] seem to be able to cast attack magic naturally. Also, a rabbit can become a type of [[youkai]] after existing for a long period of time, gaining sentience and increased abilities in the process.

There are also {{nihongo|'''Moon Rabbits'''|玉兎|gyokuto|literally "jade rabbit"}}, inhabitants of the [[Moon]] who seems to be more powerful than normal Rabbits. Moon Rabbits are seen as tools by [[Lunarians]] and are used for a large variety of tasks including farming, pounding medicine, cleaning and as soldiers in the Moon's war effort.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Cage in Lunatic Runagate]]'': [[Cage in Lunatic Runagate/Second Chapter|Second Chapter]] — "Even in the lunar capital the Lunarians saw the rabbits as nothing more than tools, so I suppose it's no surprise."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Cage in Lunatic Runagate]]'': [[Cage in Lunatic Runagate/Third Chapter|Third Chapter]] — "The rabbits of the moon are assigned various tasks. Most of them work in agricultural affairs, but many other jobs are left to them as well, such as medicine making, cleaning and the defense of the lunar capital."&lt;/ref&gt; In the Touhou world, the use of rabbits as part of the Moon's population comes from ancient tales in East Asia, possibly related to the fact that ancient Japanese people saw a [[wikipedia:Jade Rabbit|rabbit on the moon]] pounding [[wikipedia:Mochi|mochi]], as opposed to a smiling face (the "man in the Moon"). Moon rabbits are not considered to be [[youkai]] by the moon's inhabitants and [[Reisen]] displays no understanding of the term; however, where the moon rabbits came from has not been explained, and as the [[Lunarian]]s claim to have created youkai in order to regulate the earth, it is possible that the rabbits were created by similar means.

Both earth and moon rabbits have a strong connection to other rabbits of the same type. Earth rabbits can sing and dance in unison. Moon rabbits can communicate telepathically between each other across extremely long distances (like from the Moon to the Earth). &lt;ref&gt;''[[Cage in Lunatic Runagate]]'': [[Cage in Lunatic Runagate/Second Chapter|Second Chapter]] — "Reisen can communicate with the rabbits on the moon, and Tewi and the others can all dance in perfect rhythm without saying a word.&lt;/ref&gt;

Personality-wise, both moon and earth rabbits tend to be laid back and carefree. They are sociable and love lies, gossip and rumours. &lt;ref&gt;''[[Cage in Lunatic Runagate]]'': [[Cage in Lunatic Runagate/First Chapter|First Chapter]] — "Rabbits love lies, gossip and rumors, so it's hard to take much stock in what they might say."&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps as can be expected of rabbits, they do not make very good fighters, but can still be trained as such, even if reluctantly. &lt;ref&gt;''[[Cage in Lunatic Runagate]]'': [[Cage in Lunatic Runagate/Last Chapter|Last Chapter]] — "They are in charge of training the moon rabbits who are by nature unsuited to warfare." "They also take rabbits of poor behavior and train them into soldiers. Very few rabbits want to become soldiers, and they see the Watatsuki manor as more of a boot camp."&lt;/ref&gt; Living in [[Pure Land|an eternal and unchanging realm]] also causes moon rabbits to have strange mindsets by Earth standards - in particular, moon rabbits are said to have no real sense of duty or loyalty as humans would understand it, with [[Reisen Udongein Inaba]] only developing these traits due to her prolonged exposure to the [[impurity]] of Earth.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]'' - Reisen Udongein Inaba profile&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom]]'': [[Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom/Story/Reisen's Scenario|Reisen's Scenario]] — "That aside, you're rather unusual for a rabbit. Actually doing your job properly... Perhaps you've got a sense of duty?" "What I feel from you is... if I had to say, I'd call it earthliness. Like those humans, who manage to come up with their own individuality by embracing the dreams that others prepared for them. In short, you've been tainted. By this impure land. Your impure self will see nothing but lunacy in the Lunar Capital now."&lt;/ref&gt;

It is customary for earth rabbits and a mandatory duty for some moon rabbits to pound mochi into rice cakes. The earth rabbits of Eientei do this during the Monthly Lunar Festival, thought up by [[Eirin Yagokoro]] to help keep the full moon away, on the night of the full moon. &lt;ref&gt;''[[Cage in Lunatic Runagate]]'': [[Cage in Lunatic Runagate/First Chapter|First Chapter]] — "Today is the day of the Monthly Lunar Festival. This festival is held on the night when the Earth and the Moon are closest during the full moon at the time. The festival uses round objects, such as dumplings, as fake full moons in a symbolic attempt to keep the full moon far away. If the moon is far away, then the moon's emissaries will stay away, as well. Of course, I was the one who first thought up this festival."&lt;/ref&gt; They mostly dedicate this labor to Lord Daikoku (and his 180 children), who they revere, [[Kaguya Houraisan]] and Eirin Yagokoro, presumably out of respect. &lt;ref&gt;[[Silent Sinner in Blue]]: Chapter 1 — Rabbits sing that their strikes are for Lord Daikoku and his 180 children, but also sing some for Kaguya and Eirin.&lt;/ref&gt; Eirin mixes drugs into the dumpling recipe, some of which are formulated to make rabbits more excitable, since she expects the rabbits to secretly eat some themselves and wants them to enjoy the festival ([[Tewi]] has noticed this, but not directly complained). &lt;ref&gt;''[[Cage in Lunatic Runagate]]'': [[Cage in Lunatic Runagate/First_Chapter|First Chapter]] — "Tewi put her hand on the back of her head as she emphasised 'for some reason'. She probably knew about the medicine I put in the dumplings to make the rabbits more excitable."&lt;/ref&gt;
Moon rabbits meanwhile must pound mochi to atone for their master [[Chang'e]]'s sin of drinking the Hourai elixir. &lt;ref&gt;''[[Silent Sinner in Blue]]'': Chapter 2 — "Incidentally, most of the moon rabbits pound out the elixir to serve out Chang'e's punishment."&lt;/ref&gt; Although they are said to pound rice cakes, in reality they are attempting to create the Elixir of Hourai. &lt;ref&gt;[[Cage in Lunatic Runagate]]: [[Cage in Lunatic Runagate/Sixth_Chapter|Sixth Chapter]] — "Although we call them “rice cakes” what was actually in the mortar was not rice but medicine. We were trying to make a medicine called the “Hourai Elixir” that would provide eternal youth and everlasting life."&lt;/ref&gt; However, without Kaguya's power, they have yet to succeed. {{reference needed|Citation for failure to produce the Hourai Elixir needed}}

It is unspecified why or how Chang'e is or was the moon rabbits's master. In the actual legend, Chang'e ordered the moon rabbit to make a new immortality pill for her once she had ascended to the moon from the earth after consuming the original, which she stole from her husband, so that she could return to him. It is implied in the [[Touhou Project]] that Chang'e is a native Lunarian, as her true name is not Chang'e, but instead something unpronounceable to beings of the Earth. &lt;ref&gt;''[[Silent Sinner in Blue]]'': Chapter 2 — Chang'e's true name is something only those from the Moon know and can pronounce.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though they may have a humanoid appearance, you can identify earth and moon rabbits alike by the two elongated ears on the top of their heads. As pictured at right, it is notable that all of the [[Eientei]] rabbits seen in ''[[Silent Sinner in Blue]]'' are humanoid, but the ones in ''[[Inaba of the Moon and Inaba of the Earth]]'' are all in their animal forms (except for the main characters). The rabbits defending [[Eientei]] and fought as normal enemies in ''[[Imperishable Night]]'' are in humanoid form, as well. It is unclear whether moon rabbits can take animal form, as they have never been depicted doing so in canon.

Moon Rabbits, coming from a pure land such as the moon, are supposed to be close to (yet not fully) immortal (as long as they stay away from impure places such as Earth, like Lunarians), but can be killed in battle. It is stated that there are not many soldier rabbits left from the "last war". &lt;ref&gt;''[[Silent Sinner in Blue]]'': Chapter 8. — "There aren't many rabbits left who took part in the last war."&lt;/ref&gt; Whether this war was the Genso-Lunar War one thousand years ago or the Lunar War only a few decades ago was not specified.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="709">'''Raijuu''' ({{lang|ja|雷獣}}, ''raijū'' lit. ''Thunder Beast'') is a legendary creature from Japanese mythology. Its body consists either fire or lightning and it is either shaped like a [[Wikipedia:Cat|cat]], [[tanuki]], [[Wikipedia:Monkey|monkey]] or a [[Wikipedia:Weasel|weasel]]. It flies like a ball of thunder and its cry sounds like thunder. Raijuu is the accomplice of Raijin, the Shinto god of lightning. Raijuu are normally courteous and friendly, but during thunderstorms, they wreak havoc.

'''Ravens''' are a select few species of birds from the genus ''Corvus''. The term raven does not exist in Japanese and are called {{nihongo|[[crow]]s|カラス|karasu}} and the differences between the names are all scientific. Although a raven is a type of crow, not all crows can be called ravens. Ravens are usually much larger than crows with different physical features, and are much more solitary than the crow which flock in masses. They are known to live much longer than crows as well.

==Ravens in Touhou==
Ravens can be found in [[Former Hell]]. The only noticeable difference between the ravens and the crows of [[Youkai Mountain]] during [[Mountain of Faith]] is that the raven has red eyes. The crows used by [[Aya Shameimaru]] in the fighting games had red eyes as well.

===Hell Ravens===
{{nihongo|'''Hell ravens'''|地獄鴉|Jigokugarasu}} have existed in the [[Hell of Blazing Fires]] for as long as it's been burning. Unlike normal ravens, they are born from the darkness of hell.

==The Raven's Appearances==
===Windows===
Ravens have appeared on stage 6 of ''[[Subterranean Animism]]'' as general enemies. These are likely to have some sort of relationship with [[Utsuho Reiuji]]. Just like their ''[[Mountain of Faith]]'' counterparts [[crow]]s, they'll come flying onto the screen in big groups, and are non-trivial to deal with. It being stage 6, unlike crows, they'll stop flying and face towards the player, shooting bullet hell [[danmaku]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2059">A {{nihongo|'''Robot'''|ロボット|Robotto}} is any machine designed to perform a task autonomously. Robots can be controlled or programmed to have certain independent functions. They are typically capable of some form of manipulation or movement, although the term is very broad. 

==Types of robots==
===Automaton===
An {{nihongo|'''Automaton'''|オートマタ|Ōtomata|alternatively: {{lang|ja|アートマトン}} ''Ātomaton''}} is a self-operating machine that behaves or responds in a mechanical way. It's like a [[wikipedia:Vending machine|vending machine]]. It can be given input, which is either rejected or accepted. When something is bought, coins (or money) needs to be inserted into the machine. If these are the right coins, they are accepted, and the requested item is dropped. If the coins are wrong, they are rejected. The word is sometimes used to describe a robot, more specifically an autonomous robot.

===Android===
An {{nihongo|'''Android'''|アンドロイド|andoroido}} (Greek for "Man-Like") is any robot with a bipedal, [[humanoid]] appearance. Androids are common across science fiction and are often portrayed as being conscious and equivalently intelligent to [[Human|humans]], although this is not technically confirmed within Touhou canon{{cn}}. Androids in the Touhou project are depicted as very lifelike, possessing artificial flesh, hair and skin.

While mostly human in appearance they can stretch their neck to great lengths, and may be able to turn their face demonic and frightening.

Rokurokubi are often confused with Nukekubi, a similar youkai with the power to completely detach their heads.

==Rokurokubi in Touhou==
The confusion between Rokurokubi and Nukekubi appears to have blurred the distinction between the two races, as [[Sekibanki]] displays the abilities of both youkai (while also being referred to as a [[wikipedia:dullahan|dullahan]]).

The '''Saigyou Ayakashi''' ({{lang|ja|西行妖}} ''Saigyou Ayakashi'') is a [[youkai]] [[wikipedia:Cherry blossom|cherry blossom tree]] and the largest in the gardens of [[Hakugyokurou]]. It has existed in the [[Netherworld]] longer than the Ghost Princess, [[Yuyuko Saigyouji]], herself. Some of the spirits in the Netherworld remember the Saigyou Ayakashi having the most beautiful blossoms they had ever seen, but the cherry tree has not bloomed for ages. There currently seems to be a powerful seal within the Saigyou Ayakashi, leaving it unable to blossom at all during spring. Whether the tree is sealing something or whether the tree itself is being sealed remains a mystery to most outsiders.

==Backstory==
A long time ago, there lived a divinely talented poet who traveled around [[Gensokyo]].  When the poet became aware that the hour of his death drew near, he chose to begin his eternal rest under the most beautiful cherry tree he could find.  After the poet's death, word of the beauty of the cherry tree began to spread across the land.  That cherry tree has grown even more beautiful since then, charming many people into choosing to rest in peace beneath its blossoms. 

After absorbing the blood of so many people, it turned into a youkai cherry tree with the ability to lure people to their death on its own, and came to be known as the Saigyou Ayakashi.  Eventually, the beautiful blossoms of the Saigyou Ayakashi were sealed away, using the bodies of Yuyuko and several others buried beneath it, and now remains within [[Hakugyokurou]].

==Character Basis==
===Name===
The poet referred in the Saigyou Ayakashi's story is likely [[Wikipedia:Saigyō Hōshi|Saigyou]], an ancient Buddhist poet who often sung of his love of cherry blossoms and his desire to die beneath flowers. ''Ayakashi'' is a general term for supernatural beings, very similar to ''youkai'' (the kanji for ''ayakashi'' [{{lang|ja|妖}}] is identical to the ''you'' in youkai [{{lang|ja|'''妖'''怪}}]). The tree's name would mean something like "youkai tree of Saigyou".

===Design===
Shown on its sprite, Saigyou Ayakashi is simply a very large cherry blossom tree which never fully blooms. It has no leaves in it.

==Story==
During the events of [[Perfect Cherry Blossom]], [[Yuyuko Saigyouji]], the ghost of the human Yuyuko, attempted to overpower the seal on the Saigyou Ayakashi in order to both see the legendary blossoms and to resurrect the soul that was sealed within.  However, Yuyuko was unaware that the sealed soul was in fact her own, and thus all of Yuyuko's attempts to unseal the soul failed due to her unconscious self-preservation.

==Relationships==
;[[Yuyuko Saigyouji]] (Sealed soul)
Yuyuko's corpse was buried under the Saigyou Ayakashi after she committed suicide.
;[[Youmu Konpaku]] (Gardener)

==Additional Information==
===Trivia===
*It is unknown if the tree can still drain the life out of people while it's not in [[Perfect Cherry Blossom#Story|full bloom]]. However, as the charm of its flowers has been removed, and due to it now residing in the Netherworld, it is largely not a real danger.
*It appears in Yuyuko's spell card background in [[Perfect Cherry Blossom]], [[Imperishable Night]], [[Shoot the Bullet]] and [[Ten Desires]].

{{Nihongo|'''Saint'''|聖人|seijin|literally "pure person", "holy person" or "sage"}} in most definitions is a figure canonized as holy in religion, often recognized for their devotion and contributions to their faith.

Saint is used to both refer to Christian saints and to translate words with similar use from other languages and religions. In relation to Touhou, Buddhists have those they similarly revere, as does Taoism, in which the Chinese shengren ({{lang|zh|聖人}}) is used. The shengren, also used for sage, are discussed in relation to [[Hermit#Xian|Xian]] in the [[Wikipedia:Xian_(Taoism)#Zhuangzi|Zhuangzi]], but as there are many types of Xian, it may be distinct from its [[hermit]] usage.

[[wikipedia:Prince Shotoku|Prince Shotoku]] (the basis for [[Toyosatomimi no Miko]]) came to be considered a saint after his death.

In the [[Touhou Project]], it is rare to find a scientist in [[Gensokyo]] while the few amateur scientists have caused major problems. As said above, there has also been consequences in ''[[Subterranean Animism]]'' and after effects in ''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2541">'''Shikigami''' ({{lang|ja|式神}}) is the term used for the summoned spirits of an "[[wikipedia:Onmyōdō#Onmyōji|onmyouji]]", a Japanese sorcerer. Shikigami are used to protect and serve their master, much like the Western concept of the witch's familiar. There are many types of shikigami described in legend, the most common type being enchanted paper cutouts that can produce the illusion of another real-life object.

Shikigami often share a special link to their masters, which may cause their onmyouji to receive sympathetic injuries dealt to the shikigami. Because of this link and the enormous amount of energy needed to maintain shikigami, onmyouji do not usually summon more than one or two shikigami at a time.

==Shikigami in Touhou==
In the ''[[Touhou Project]]'', shikigami are distinct entities that have been converted into a shikigami through a certain technique. For example, [[Ran Yakumo]] was originally a fox that transformed into a [[youkai]], but now serves as [[Yukari Yakumo]]'s shikigami. In this role, she is bound to do what Yukari tells her to.

Though it can be assumed that possessing a shikigami requires a large amount of energy in the Touhou universe, Ran has been around long enough and is powerful enough to have a shikigami of her own, [[Chen]], who was "converted" from a youkai being the same way she was.

[[Hieda no Akyu]] describes this process of converting a being into a shikigami with the word "installing", as if one was installing software onto a computer. (On this point, there have been many sayings in Touhou that likened Shikigami to computers.&lt;ref&gt;[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Ran Yakumo]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Chen]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Curiosities_of_Lotus_Asia/Chapter_16]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Cage_in_Lunatic_Runagate/Fifth_Chapter]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20040404190222/http://www16.big.or.jp/~zun/cgi-bin/diary/nicky.cgi?page=1 ZUN's former blog, a post on 2004 January 04]&lt;/ref&gt;) Even Yukari compares a shikigami to a computer. By putting on such a formula, getting angry would be understandable if program does odd jobs or does not work, though Ran in her case doesn't seem to complain when getting punished by her master and is rather satisfied.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3299">'''Shinigami''' ({{lang|ja|死神}}, death gods) are quasi-mythological beings inspired by the Western [[wikipedia:Grim Reaper|Grim Reaper]]; while they are not part of [[Shinto]] or [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] beliefs, they frequently appear in fiction based on them. 

==Shinigami in Touhou==
In the [[Touhou Project]], shinigami might occupy different roles, and their duties include recording lifespans of the living, acting as a guide to souls unfamiliar with [[Hell]], recording the proceedings of the [[Yama]]'s court, and ferrying the souls of the deceased to the Yama so that they can be judged.&lt;br /&gt;
Due to a lie spread by the shinigami, most people believe their life is over at the sight of a shinigami, a reputation bolstered by the large scythe the shinigami carry with them. The belief goes that a few are actually charged with taking the souls of the expired, and that these shinigami may be fought with just as any other creature, allowing stronger beings to continually prolong their lifespan ([[celestial]]s are notorious for this, disguising their victory as guaranteed immortality). In truth, normal humans would just die naturally, and only people who exceedingly extend their lives are attacked, and this isn't done by shinigami but by [[kishin]] chiefs, a class of powerful oni residing in [[Hell]], such as [[Suiki]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'' Chapter 12&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gensokyo]]'s only known shinigami, [[Komachi Onozuka]], ferries souls to [[Higan]] by crossing the [[Sanzu River]], a [[wikipedia:Sanzu|river in Japanese Buddhism]] analogous to the Greek [[wikipedia:River Styx|River Styx]]. That means bringing souls to the [[Yama]] (or Enma) [[Eiki Shiki, Yamaxanadu]]. While Komachi is a ferry guide of the Sanzu, not all shinigami occupy this position, as stated above.

Shinigami can apparently see the life span of the living (and are presumably unable to see the immortal as they have no life span). Komachi offers the eyes of the shinigami in exchange for half their life span. This is likely a reference to [[wikipedia:Death Note|another well known series]] and is possibly just a joke made by Komachi.&lt;ref&gt;[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View/Story/Komachi's Script|''Phantasmagoria of Flower View'': VS Mode]]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Komachi, they are also capable of inflicting a powerful fear effect in normal humans, by using a mental attack against ''"an open crack in their hearts"''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody/Story/Komachi's Scenario#Stage 1]]&lt;/ref&gt; Apparently, this allows them to subdue most possible human opponents before the fight even starts, so being simply strong wouldn't be enough to delay one's inevitable demise. Hermits and celestials seem to be immune to this effect, probably due to their altered state of mind, hence they stand a chance in a clash against a Reaper. However, as said before, shinigami aren't actually charged with the duty of ending the life of living beings, so this might as well be a lie.

It was written about in a Chinese novel and later adapted by Akutagawa Ryuunosuke's "The Wine Worm".

==Shuchuu in Touhou==
According to [[Suika Ibuki]], shuchuu are something like a companion to the [[Oni]]. [[Eirin Yagokoro]] mentions that shuchuu are the crystillization of the oni's technology.

Different subspecies of raccoon dogs have either a prefix before tanuki, called by their native name, or known by their scientific name. Tanuki are usually represented with large bellies, which they may beat on like a drum. The males are also often depicted with infamously large "balls," which are meant to represent financial fortune.

'''Bake-danuki''' ({{lang|ja|化け狸}}, "monster raccoon dog") is the [[youkai]] form of the tanuki in Japanese folklore; in addition to shapeshifting into [[human]]s, bake-danuki can transform into objects such as trees or teapots. Leaves are often a component to the tanuki's shapeshifting magic, and bake-danuki would often fool merchants by paying them with leaves disguised as paper money. Like the [[wikipedia:Maneki Neko|maneki neko]], tanuki are believed to represent good fortune, and they are often associated with precious metals.

==Tanuki in Touhou==
Bake-danuki are very common youkai in Gensokyo much like how the Raccoon Dogs as a whole are a successful species throughout East Asia and to many introduced areas.&lt;ref name="bou_n_1"&gt;''[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]]'': [[Symposium of Post-mysticism/Mamizou Futatsuiwa|Mamizou Futatsuiwa]]&lt;/ref&gt; Tanuki appear to be the first culprit for minor events such as [[Reisen]] being mistaken for one by [[Reimu Hakurei]] during her travel to earth in ''[[Silent Sinner in Blue]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5503">A {{nihongo|'''tengu'''|天狗||literally "heaven dog"}} is a form of [[youkai]] common in Japanese mythology. In general, tengu are analogous to the Western idea of goblins. 

Two main subspecies of tengu exist. The {{nihongo|''crow tengu''|烏天狗|karasu-tengu}}, are similar to anthropomorphic [[crow]]s with a humanoid body structure, whilst the {{nihongo|''yamabushi tengu''|山伏天狗}} resemble [[wikipedia:yamabushi|yamabushi]] monks with red skin and very long noses.

Tengu are said to be mischievous and sometimes malicious, with a propensity for playing pranks on [[human]]s, but stories also exist of them acting as mentors. Although they disdain the proud and arrogant, they are often guilty of those same flaws. They are also associated with the arts of war and politics.

Objects often associated with the tengu include the ''shakujo'', a ring-tipped staff used for magic or physical combat; the ''tokin,'' a strangely-shaped hat which can also be used as a divining cup; and the ''hauchiwa'' fan, which can be made from the leaves of the Japanese Aralia or from feathers, and is said to have the power to create gale-force winds. Tengu are also commonly depicted wearing ''tengu geta'', a type of ''[[wikipedia:geta (footwear)|geta]]'' sandals with one tall slat rather than two shorter ones, making it extremely difficult for a human wearer to keep their balance. The majority of these items are derived from traditional yamabushi garb.

==Tengu in Touhou==
The tengu of [[Gensokyo]] are known for their love of gossip and writing newspapers. Tengu reside in [[Youkai Mountain]] and seem territorial of humans and other youkai trespassing within their home. According to [[Aya Shameimaru]], they are great drinkers, only rivaled by [[Oni]]. The tengu once had a written language of their own, but no one remains who can read it.

===Types of Tengu===
{{stub}}
Akyuu in ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'' describes the classifications of the tengu as follows:

====Tenma, Boss of the Tengu====
'''Tenma (Tengu no BOSU)''' ({{lang|ja|天魔(天狗のボス)}}, ''Tenma (Boss of the Tengu)'') is said to have made a deal with the Mountain God (presumably [[Kanako Yasaka|Kanako]]).

====Great Tengu====
{{nihongo|'''Great Tengu'''|大天狗|dai tengu}} are the "management types", and correspond to middle-ranked bosses. They can give orders to regular tengu, and their command in this regard is absolute. They might even give orders to other youkai living on the mountain, but in this case, there is no guarantee that said youkai will obey them. [[Megumu Iizunamaru]]'s character title in [[Unconnected Marketeers]], "Chief of the Crow Tengu", might imply that different kinds of Tengu are subject to a different chief that commands them.&lt;ref&gt;[[Unconnected Marketeers]] - Megumu Iizunamaru's profile&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Hatate's spell card comments about [[Yuugi Hoshiguma|Yuugi]] and Suika in Double Spoiler states she suspects that they are either trying to hide something or are trying to prevent the tengu from getting too close with the [[Oni]]. She also believes that they're simply trying to use [[Suwako Moriya|Suwako]] and Kanako for their own ends (and they the same regarding the tengu), and wishes everyone would just lighten up.

====Crow Tengu====
[[File:084.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Crow tengu as seen in Curiosities of Lotus Asia]]
{{nihongo|'''Crow Tengu'''|烏天狗|karasu-tengu}}, the "nimble information corps", are similar to anthropomorphic crows with a humanoid body structure. Since they're responsible for writing and distributing newspapers, they're the only type of tengu that ventures to the foothills.&lt;ref name="symposium"&gt;[[Symposium of Post-mysticism/Part 3|''Symposium of Post-mysticism'' - Part 3]]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Long-nose Tengu====
{{nihongo|'''Long-nose Tengu'''|鼻高天狗|hanataka tengu|"high nose tengu"}} "specialize in business work" and are rarely seen by outsiders. While map-making is one of their duties, nowadays their "Gottsui Positioning System" (GPS) lets them do so without going outside.&lt;ref name="symposium"/&gt;

====White Wolf Tengu====
[[File:ThGK Bunbunmaru6.jpg|thumb|220px|right|White Wolf Tengu at Youkai Mountain]]
{{nihongo|'''White Wolf Tengu'''|白狼天狗|hakurou tengu}} are the "mountain's defense force", responsible for keeping out intruders. They're known as avid players of [[wikipedia:shogi|shogi]], particularly various forms of their own "Great Tengu Shogi"; with dozens of extra pieces and rules, a single game of which can last for days.&lt;ref&gt;[[Symposium of Post-mysticism/Bunbunmaru Newspaper 11|''Symposium of Post-mysticism'' - Bunbunmaru Newspaper 11]]&lt;/ref&gt; The white wolf tengu are likely based on either the Chinese ''[[wikipedia:tiangou|tiangou]]'' (whom tengu derive their name from), or a type of doglike tengu known as a {{nihongo||狗賓|guhin}}.

====Yamabushi Tengu====
{{nihongo|'''Yamabushi Tengu'''|山伏天狗||"[[wikipedia:Shugendo|Shugendo]] monk tengu"; literally "mountain-dwelling tengu"}} are "the printers."

The {{nihongo|'''Three Fairies of Light'''|光の三妖精|Hikari no San-Yousei}}, or the {{nihongo|'''Three Fairies'''|三妖精|San-Yousei}} for short, also called the '''Three Mischievous Fairies''', are a small group of [[fairy|fairies]] composed of [[Sunny Milk]], [[Luna Child]], and [[Star Sapphire]]. They are known for causing mischief to [[human]]s by playing pranks on them using their powers. They are the protagonists of the ''[[Touhou Sangetsusei]]'' manga series, and the antagonists of ''[[Fairy Wars]]''.

==Background Information==
[[File:FS Three Fairies of Light.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The Three Fairies of Light in ''[[Forbidden Scrollery]]'']]
===Name===
The "three lights" refer to the sun, moon, and stars, the most clearly visible lights in the sky. It is from these lights that the fairies derive their power and after which they have been named. Many of their [[spell card]]s reflect how they derive their power. These three lights are also referred to in the name of work in which they appeared; The title of the manga, {{nihongo|"Sangetsusei"|三月精}} is a wordplay, which loosely means "sun, moon, stars" respectively based on pronunciation, whereas "三精/Sansei/Three Sprites" used to be the old name for these three heavenly bodies put together. {{nihongo||三|san}} can also mean {{nihongo||サン|san|Katakana transliteration of English "sun"}}, {{nihongo||月|getsu|"moon"}} stays the same and {{nihongo||精|sei|"fairy"}} shares the same sound as {{nihongo||星|sei|"star"}}.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Eastern and Little Nature Deity]]'': [[Shanghai Alice Correspondence Three Fairies Version/Volume 5|Shanghai Alice Correspondence Three Fairies Version - Volume 5]]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="961">'''Tigers''' ({{lang|ja|虎}}, ''tora''), scientifically known as ''Panthera tigris'' are felines found through South and East Asia and are the largest of the big cats. Tigers did once inhabit Japan, however they went extinct during the late Pleistocene along with many of the megafauna of the Japanese archipelago. The Japanese tiger is not well known and likely played no part in the tiger folklore in Japan due to the extinction of the animal being early on in human evolution and other extinct megafauna around the same era not familar to the Japanese until recent era.

==Tigers in Touhou==
In [[ZUN]]'s interview on ''[[Undefined Fantastic Object]]'', he was unsure about tigers in Japan and said that a large tiger like animal may have existed before in Japan.

Tsuchigumo are subterranean creatures but sometimes live in forests and caves.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3976">A {{nihongo|'''tsukumogami'''|付喪神}} is a type of [[youkai]] produced from a tool or object inhabited by one of the [[Yaoyorozu no Kami]].

In Japanese legend, all types of tsukumogami gain life and sentience on the 100th anniversary of their creation, and can range from harmless and friendly beings to horrifying [[onryou|vengeful spirits]], depending on how they were treated and used. 

==Tsukumogami in Touhou==
In the ''[[Touhou Project]]'', tsukumogami are formed from the [[god]] inside the object becoming angry at its disposal and becoming animate to do harm to those who threw it away disrespectfully.  Their appearance is highly variable, but is based on the item they came from; for instance, [[Kogasa Tatara]] is an umbrella tsukumogami known as a '''karakasa obake'''. In general, they are known to be malevolent towards [[human]]s because they desire vengeance on those that threw them away.

As shown in ''[[Forbidden Scrollery]]'' Chapter 5, when Tsukumogami first form, they appear as the object they were formed from with a set of legs attached. In this early stage, they are referred to as baby tsukumogamis.

[[Mamizou Futatsuiwa]] states that [[tanuki]] banquets helps raise a tsukumogami's spiritual power, and thus tsukumogami and [[bake-danuki]]s have outstanding compatibility with each other.

==Types of Tsukumogami==
This lists all the types of Tsukumogami that appear in Touhou.

===Karakasa obake===
The {{nihongo|'''karakasa obake'''|唐傘おばけ}} are umbrellas that are typically portrayed with one eye, a long tongue protruding from an open mouth, and a single foot, generally wearing a [[wikipedia:Geta (footwear)|geta]]. However, it is unknown if this is their natural appearance in Touhou, as [[Kogasa Tatara]] tells [[Sanae Kochiya]] in ''[[Undefined Fantastic Object]]'' that she "did my best to look youkai-like." and [[Hieda no Akyuu]] states in ''[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]]'' that "The design of the umbrella is thought to have been modified to be based on" Ippon Datara.

In [[ZUN]]'s interview on ''Undefined Fantastic Object'', he stated that "karakasa obake" does not have much of a meaning behind it; it is simply a tsukumogami of an umbrella. Thus Kogasa was not given much of a story behind her and her past was much like her folklore counterpart.

===Ungaikyo===
The {{nihongo|'''Ungaikyo'''|雲外鏡||lit. "mirror far above the clouds"}} are living mirrors that occasionally have occult powers. They are [[demon]]s that come out of antique mirrors.

===Biwabokuboku===
The {{nihongo|'''biwabokuboku'''|琵琶牧々}} are ''biwa'', the Japanese string musical instruments similar to lute, that became youkai.

===Kotofurunushi===
The {{nihongo|'''kotofurunushi'''|琴古主}} are ''koto'', the Japanese traditional stringed musical instruments, that became youkai.

===Menreiki===
:''Main article: [[Menreiki]]''
The {{nihongo|'''menreiki'''|面霊気||roughly "mask essence"}} is a youkai born from a collection of masks; in Touhou it is considered to be a type of tsukumogami.

===Kutsutsura===
The {{nihongo|'''kutsutsura'''|沓頬|| "shoe-face"}} is a kind of tsukumogami born either from a shoe or from a crown. The first type steals melons, the second steals plums. In Touhou, both types are mentioned, but only the shoe type has been seen.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2058">'''Turtles''' ({{lang|ja|亀}}, ''kame'') are a group of reptiles, identified by a shell developed from their ribs that acts as a shield. The earliest turtles date back from 215 million years ago. These reptiles have the ability to stay underwater for long periods at a time. Turtles are known to live a long life and, depending on the species, they can live from 10 to 100 years at most.

==Species==
===Softshell Turtle===
'''Softshell turtles''' ({{lang|ja|スッポン}}, ''Suppon'') are turtles in the ''Trionychidae'' family. These light-shelled fresh water turtles are found in Africa, Asia, North America, and Southeast Asia. They are among some of the world's largest fresh water turtles.

===Sea Turtle===
'''Sea turtles''' ({{lang|ja|海亀}}, ''Umigame'') are turtles in the ''Cheloniidae'' and ''Dermochelyidae'' family. They are marine reptiles that inhabit all of the world's oceans except the Arctic.

==Turtles in Touhou==
In ''[[Strange and Bright Nature Deity]]'' Chapter 12, there was a discussion between [[Reimu Hakurei]] and [[Marisa Kirisame]]. It appears that there is a pond in the back of the [[Hakurei Shrine]] that inhabits some turtles.

While the type of turtle he is, is unknown, using [[Genjii]] as an example, they could possibly live longer if they evolve to a type of [[Youkai]].

According to [[Rinnosuke Morichika]] in [[Curiosities of Lotus Asia/Chapter_18|Curiosities of Lotus Asia Chapter 18]], kappa are youkai variants of softshell turtles. It is also known that while Rinnosuke is aware of sea turtles, they are only found in the outside world.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12017">{{nihongo|'''Vampires'''|吸血鬼|kyūketsuki|lit. "blood-sucking [[oni]]"}} are creatures from Western folklore that drink the blood of humans to survive. They possess a number of powerful abilities, including super-strength, super-speed, summoning demons, transforming into a swarm of bats, regeneration, and eternal life.  They also have a lot of weaknesses, including sunlight (which is why vampires are usually active at night) and flowing water (such as rain or a river). Similar but unrelated beings can be found in Asian folklore, such as the [[Jiang Shi]].

==Weaknesses==
Although vampires have been portrayed to have enormous power (maybe), at any rate, they've got a great number of weaknesses. The following are weaknesses that vampires have been confirmed to mention about themselves in ''[[Touhou Project]]''. Also, since the word vampire ({{lang|ja|吸血'''鬼'''}}) seem to have the [[wikipedia:Kanji|Kanji]] {{nihongo||鬼|oni}} in them, whatever weaknesses [[oni]] have, vampires also have them in a similar way. It should be noted that a lot of different works with a fictional universe take different approaches as to what weaknesses a vampire's got.

;Turning into ashes or vaporising upon sunlight
:Provided, it is not like disintegrating on the spot from exposure to sunlight, nor is it like the legends where vampires burn up. It's more to the extent of the skin flaking off gradually. Also, vampires seem to be quite composed when it's not direct sunlight, and therefore they are able to go outside under the shadow of a parasol. Furthermore, when they are burned up due to sunlight, they're able to absorb the residue, and thus become essentially immortal.

;Skin burning upon touching roasted soybeans
:This is a weakness that vampires share with oni. However, it seems fine if it's not roasted soybeans.

;Inability to cross flowing water
:Since on a rainy day, where the sky and the earth all becomes "flowing water", vampires cannot physically go outside. On clear days, only in certain places there's flowing water, and what this means in the end for rivers etc. is uncertain. The popular theory is that it wouldn't be possible to swim and cross over, but it would be no problem to go on a boat or fly over.

;Crosses
:The reason why vampires in general have a weakness to crosses is because the legends of vampires today have originally taken form in an area that is deeply rooted in [[Christianity]], and it's because in those legends, vampires come about when a [[human]]'s blood is sucked by another vampire. In short, if a pious Christian becomes a vampire like this, and if they succumb to their instincts and perform the action of sucking blood, each time they look at the cross, they will remember the depth of the sin, meaning that they'll then feel a guilty conscience.
:To the very end, since it's a guilty conscience, even if you just show them the cross, they'll be startled, and the effect is that they will lose their fighting spirit. However, in the case of a ''silver'' cross, there is also a theory as for why it would take effect regardless of faith and piety. (See also the Silver Weapons section).

;Flames
:Since flames contain purification power, it is said that the damage dealt to vampires by burning with flames cannot be recovered. Before considering how flames could have purification power, they also have the ability to inflict more or less damage physically.

;Garlic
:Since garlic has high nutritional value, it is said they have an effect on all kinds of illnesses, it is considered that they have an ability to dispel [[Evil spirit|evil spirits]]. Furthermore since they have a strong odor, they are said to be able to make [[devil]]s unable to come close (although [[god]]s also seem not to be able to come close).

;Silver Weapons
:The reason silver stakes or bullets are said to have an effect on vampires is because silver is chemically reactive to arsenic and sulfur, changing its colour and its properties, and silver ions have a strong disinfectant effect against bacteria. In the time of the origins of the legends of vampires, since ions and bacteria have not been elucidated, it was suspicious that they would have a disinfectant effect, and so in order for nobles to avoid assassination, it was common sense to unify weapons with silver. Furthermore, since a major accessory attached to the body was the cross, it was common to make them out of silver as a poisonous distinguishing accessory. From details like this, silver has thus become considered to have the power to drive away impure things, and thus they've been considered a weakness of the representative of impure things, vampires.

;Inability to go into houses uninvited
:This is according to [[wikipedia:Christianity|Christianity]], that "devils do not come close to places where they are not welcome". Although they are not able to evade doors for which consent cannot be gained, if you successfully invite them even just once, it will thereon be a free pass to the house. There are also vampires who do petty-minded great effort in disguising and deceiving target [[human]]s to get a "yes" out of them.

;Death upon a stake through the heart or death upon beheading
:If a [[human]] does this kind of thing to an ordinary living thing, then without omission they'll die, but since vampires neither age nor die, it's said that there aren't many measures to annihilate them. It's useless if the stake isn't white ash, and although there are various theories saying that any kind of tree is okay, but it seems to be generally agreed upon that iron and glass stakes are no good.
:Concerning the parts related to this weakness as well as the part related to silver, it has been a legend passed on that has existed much further back into the past than the "[[wikipedia:Count Dracula|Count Dracula]]" that has formed our present image of vampires, going back to around the 4th century.

;Inability to get close to sardine heads
:This is also a weakness of oni.

;Inability to get close to broken holly branches
:Same as previous.

==Vampires in Touhou==
Vampires in [[Gensokyo]] are a young but powerful [[youkai]] species, considered to be a type of [[devil]]. They possess a far broader range of abilities than most youkai, including [[oni]]-level strength and [[tengu]]-level speed, but also have a far broader range of weaknesses. Vampires in Gensokyo show no paticular aversion to the [[Christian]] cross, though they can still be harmed by spiritual attacks like any [[youkai]]; they do, however, show a vulnerability to roasted soybeans, presumably a result of being identified with [[oni]]. While sunlight has the power to destroy them, they can survive brief exposures, and even travel around at day as long as they remain in the shade. They also forfeit growth and maturity, and are thus biologically [[immortal]].

[[Remilia Scarlet|Remilia]] and [[Flandre Scarlet|Flandre]] Scarlet are the only members of the vampire species in [[Gensokyo]],&lt;ref name="PMiSSRemilia"&gt;[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]: [[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Remilia Scarlet|Remilia Scarlet]]&lt;/ref&gt; to the point where most characters simply refer to Remilia as "the vampire" instead of by name. There exists a contract between vampires and other youkai where the vampires pledge not to attack the humans of Gensokyo, in exchange for receiving humans to feed on; being a devil's contract, it is unbreakable. Remilia was the primary instigator of the [[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Reimu Hakurei|incident]] that led to the creation of this contract and eventually the [[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Draft of Spell Card Rules|spell card rules]].

Additionally, the [[PC-98]] comes into play because [[Kurumi]] is also a vampire. Thus, if linking the PC-98 canon with the [[Windows]] canon, then there are in fact three vampires in Gensokyo and [[Hieda no Akyuu]] would be incorrect saying that the scarlet sisters are the only two.

===Touhou's Weaknesses===
Since all of the above said on the "[[#A Vampire's Weakness|A Vampire's Weakness]]" section was what vampires mentioned about themselves, it's uncertain if some of these statements are actually true in the ''[[Touhou Project]]''. However, the weaknesses to sunlight and water are certain.&lt;ref name="th08_manual"&gt;[[Imperishable Night]]: Manual&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red]]'', [[Patchouli Knowledge]] put forth the consideration that "perhaps these weaknesses are for the sake of camouflaging their other big weaknesses." Moreover, [[Remilia Scarlet]] likes [[wikipedia:Nattō|fermented soybeans]], because they're not roasted. She also dislikes Patchouli's Setsubon festivals because merely picking up the roasted soybeans burns her, and she forbids anyone from throwing any at her. It's unknown if this is because of a shared weakness to roast soybeans, or if the soybeans were simply too hot.

With regards to weaknesses, in reality, whatever damage is inflicted, by their aforementioned regeneration ability, they are simply able to return back to how they were originally, and thus in order to do vampire extermination, but it doesn't inflict a fatal wound on their first try, then there's no meaning. Thus, the cases where they don't become weaknesses are not few.

Additionally, in ''Touhou Project'', the general weaknesses of vampires have become as following:
*Whether or not it is because of the nature of the effect, or if it is for some other reason, Remilia seems to be strong to Crosses. Also, [[Flandre Scarlet]] used crosses in her [[spell card]]s, and [[Aya Shameimaru]] wonders if they are immune to crosses in ''[[Shoot the Bullet]]''. 
*In relation to flames, when Remilia touched the rocket when not been told to in ''[[Silent Sinner in Blue]]'', her wrist was set ablaze and burnt to black by Patchouli's spell, but was able to recover in an instant without worry.&lt;ref&gt;'''SSiB''' Chapter 6&lt;/ref&gt; Before considering how flames could have purification power, they've also got the ability to inflict more or less damage physically, but it doesn't seem that in the ''[[Touhou Project]]''; it isn't possible to recover from damage by flames. Also, in ''[[Strange and Bright Nature Deity]]'', Remilia claims that not even the fires of hell could burn her body.&lt;ref&gt;'''SaBND Chapter 15 - ''Remilia:''''' ''Who do you think i am? Even the fires of hell could not burn my body.''&lt;/ref&gt; While this could be just a manner of speech, relating this to what happened in ''Silent Sinner in Blue'', there is a possibiliy of vampires being highly resistent to fire.
*Remilia hates garlic,&lt;ref name="th08_manual" /&gt; but this doesn't seem to be related to a weakness as a vampire anywhere in the ''[[Touhou Project]]''.
*In ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'', since [[Hieda no Akyuu]] seemed to be saying that "the knives that Sakuya possesses are silver knives for exterminating vampires", it seems that there exists the general idea that Touhou's vampires are weak to silver.
*In relation to how Remilia enters the [[Hakurei Shrine]] with an invitation, although it is possible to interpret that to be because [[Reimu Hakurei]] has invited her before, there was an instance where she was an "invader" breaking into [[Eientei]] in ''[[Imperishable Night]]'', and therefore this weakness does not exist in  Touhou.
*Regarding the "death by beheading" part, since ''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]'' stated that "she will recover back to normal even if everything other than the head has been blown away", the situation is that it is unrelated to Remilia.

A {{nihongo|'''vengeful spirit'''|怨霊|onryou}} is a special type of [[ghost]] created under special circumstances. When a person dies, they must wait on the [[Sanzu River]] for a [[shinigami]] to ferry them across. However, if a [[youkai]] steals their body away before they cross the river, that person will become a vengeful spirit. Unlike normal [[ghost]]s and [[phantom]]s, vengeful spirits are hot to the touch.

==Sub-Species==
===Evil Spirit===
An {{nihongo|'''evil spirit'''|悪霊|akuryou}} is another kind of vengeful spirit, briefly referenced across the series.

[[Mima]] is described to be an evil spirit in her profile in ''[[Mystic Square]]'', making her the only known one thus far. Evil spirits were mentioned by [[Reimu Hakurei]] on the first stage of ''[[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]]'' and again in Chapter 25 of ''[[Curiosities of Lotus Asia]]'', where she describes an evil spirit (presumably Mima) taking over the [[Hakurei Shrine]]. It is unknown what exactly makes evil spirits distinct.

==Vengeful spirits in Touhou==
[[File:Apparition.png|thumb|left|200px|An apparition being held by [[Kasen Ibaraki]]]]
In ''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'', [[Kasen Ibara]] describes them as criminal spirits, those that committed sins while alive. These vengeful spirits were confined to the [[Former Hell]], but leaked back to the surface due to the acts of [[Rin Kaenbyou]], who learned how to control them. Vengeful spirits are feared by [[human]]s and youkai alike throughout [[Gensokyo]].

Recently, the [[Underground Geyser Center]] has been plagued by these vengeful spirits. 

Not to be confused with normal [[ghost]]s and [[poltergeist]]s, vengeful spirits appear to only take on a non-[[human]] form, and [[Soga no Tojiko]] is described in ''[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]]'' as a vengeful spirit who is losing her grudge and becoming a simple thunder-causing [[ghost]]. In the [[Subterranean Animism/Translation/Prologue|prologue to ''Subterranean Animism'']], they are referred to as {{nihongo|'''earth spirits'''|地霊|chirei}}, but in all the dialogue, as well as the extra story, they are referred to as onryou. Their appearance mostly involves a skull in a form of a spirit.

[[Mizuchi Miyadeguchi]] is a vengeful spirit.

==Vengeful Spirit's Appearances==

===PC-98===
[[Mima]], the main antagonist of [[Story of Eastern Wonderland]] and one of the protagonists of [[Mystic Square]] is a vengeful spirit.
===Windows===
Vengeful spirits appeared on stage 4 of ''[[Subterranean Animism]]'', supporting [[Rin Kaenbyou]] during her midboss appearances as a [[cat]]. On stage 5, they independently come in groups and cause an explosion of [[danmaku]] towards the player if destroyed. They are again supporting Rin during her battles on the stage. On stage 6, they'll some scrolling down the screen in long queues. Strangely, they are not shown to have a skull. Despite their similarities on their sprites, they are not to be confused with the [[divine spirit]]s in ''[[Ten Desires]]''.
;Foul Detective Satori
===Print Works===
[[Mizuchi Miyadeguchi]], the main antagonist of [[Foul Detective Satori]], is a vengeful spirit.

===Spin-offs===

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1357">{{nihongo|'''Wanyuudou'''|輪入道||lit. "Wheel Priest"}} are creatures in Japanese mythology and are quite popular [[youkai]]. Wanyuudou usually appear as a giant, shaved monk's head trapped within a flaming ox-cart wheel. Wanyuudou are servants of [[Hell]], but will spend most of their time on Earth searching for impure souls to take back to Hell with them. Wanyuudou are constantly suffering thanks to the pain inflicted upon them from the flames and the wheel. Whenever a wanyuudou finds an ideal victim (usually a criminal or a corrupt priest, but can also be an ordinary person), they drag the person back to Hell to be judged and damned. The wanyuudou repeats this process until the sins they committed during their lifetime have been redeemed. Whenever a wanyuudou is spotted, smart townsfolk stay at home and away from all windows and doors to avoid being noticed. Anyone who is extra cautious will decorate their homes with demon-repelling prayer charms in hopes the demon wheel would not come near. Even witnessing a wanyuudou is enough to inflict a curse unto the entire family and most would have their souls ripped from their bodies and brought to Hell by the demon wheel.

{{nihongo|'''Wolves'''|狼|ookami}} are [[Animal#Mammal|mammals]] often identified as the gray wolf, scientifically known as ''Canis lupus'', although a few other [[animal]]s in the ''Canis'' genus have been named wolves as well. The gray wolf is widely dispersed throughout the world wherever [[human]]s live. Like humans, because wolves are so widely distributed across the world, they come in various color, shape, and size despite being the same species.

==Sub-species==
===Dog===
The domestic {{nihongo|'''dog'''|犬|Inu}} is a sub-species of gray wolf which evolved alongside humans. Scientifically known as ''Canis lupus familiaris'', dogs have lived together with humans since the prehistoric era. They were originally born to assist humans in hunting and gathering, but have become normal pets in the modern era. They should however not to be confused with wild dogs, which are separate species of animals.

===Yamainu===
The {{nihongo|'''yamainu'''|ヤマイヌ/山犬|Mountain Dog}}, more commonly known as the {{nihongo|Japanese wolf|日本狼|Nihonookami}} are one of two extinct sub-species of gray wolves that were native to the Japanese archipelago. They were scientifically known as ''Canis lupus hodophilax'' and is officially classified as extinct since the last animal's death in 1905. The Japanese wolf is known to play a major role in Japanese folklore and mythology.

==Wolves in Touhou==
The yamainu are animals that still exist in [[Gensokyo]] and are living in the mountains as shown in ''[[Oriental Sacred Place]]'' chapter 16. [[Marisa Kirisame]] suspects that the attacks on humans by the wolves are due to the abnormal weather causing a shortage of supplies on the mountain. Aside from the yamainu, normal stray dogs also appear to wander around Gensokyo.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1586">The '''[[wikipedia:Yama (Buddhism and Chinese mythology)|Yama]]''' ({{lang|ja|閻魔}}), also called '''Enma''' ({{lang|ja|えんま}}) in Japan, is a Buddhist equivalent of [[wikipedia:Yama|the Hindu god of the same name]]. This is the judge of the deceased that decides who goes where after death. According to Buddhism, there are ten Yama, each presiding over a hell. However, in Chinese folklore, Yama is sometimes understood simply as a specific role in the hierarchy of celestial beings, with even virtuous humans sometimes being elevated to such a rank. The Buddhist image of Yama as a judge dressed in the robes of a Chinese official was influenced by the god Taizan Fukun, depicted as an administrator of the afterlife keeping a registery of the dead. Yama can look into the past deeds of any person, and it is said that no one can pass through their sermons without being scolded.

==Yama in Touhou==
[[Eiki Shiki, Yamaxanadu]] is the yama assigned to [[Gensokyo]]. According to [[Toyosatomimi no Miko]], the yama is the one to which the [[wikipedia:Three Corpses|three worms]] actually report the sins of human beings.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]]'' - [[Symposium of Post-mysticism/Bunbunmaru Newspaper 8|Bunbunmaru Newspaper, Miko article]]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2936">A '''''yamabiko''''' ({{lang|ja|山彦}}, {{lang|ja|幽谷響}}) is a spirit/youkai/god known in the Japanese folklore. In modern Japanese, {{nihongo||やまびこ, 山彦 ["幽谷響" {{lang|en|can't be used here}}]|yamabiko}} is a word that refers to the phenomenon of the "reflection of sounds in mountains or valleys". In the old days of Japan, people thought [[wikipedia:Echo (phenomenon)|echoes]] occurred because a yamabiko living in the mountains replied back or manipulated the sound. The wilds of Japan are full of strange phenomena, like echoes that bounce back with more delay than they should, or that come back slightly different from the original sound. When the false echo comes from the forest, it is usually attributed to a ko-dama. When it comes from the mountains, it is due to these yamabiko. Yamabiko are known almost exclusively by their voices alone, which are skilled at mimicking any sound, including natural sounds, human language, and more recently, trains and cars. They also occasionally unleash terrible and mysterious screams deep in the forests that can carry for very long distances. Little is known about these yokai due to their rarity and elusiveness. They live deep in the mountains and make their homes in camphor trees, living in close proximity to (and sharing a common ancestry with) the other tree and mountain spirits. For many centuries, their calls were speculated to be a kind of rare bird, other kinds of yokai, or even a natural phenomena. It wasn’t until the Edo period when determined yokai researchers like Sawaki Sūshi and Toriyama Sekien were able to confirm the creature’s existence and record its true shape.

==Yamabiko in Touhou==
Yamabiko were once a common [[youkai]] that lived on every mountain. When the rumors within the [[human]]s of the [[Human Village|village]] created a natural explanation for the voices of the yamabiko, many humans had stopped shouting at the mountains. This resulted in the death of many yamabiko and their population continues to decline, threatening their species to a natural extinction.&lt;ref name="bou_n_1"&gt;''[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]]'': [[Symposium of Post-mysticism/Kyouko Kasodani|Kyouko]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Yamabiko are the only youkai in [[Gensokyo]] who are known to be threatened to extinction due to reason of the natural world. Although, because the health of their population was never stated, it is not known to what extent their numbers had dropped to or the rate at which they're continuing to drop.&lt;ref name="bou_n_1"&gt;''[[Symposium of Post-mysticism]]'': [[Symposium of Post-mysticism/Kyouko Kasodani|Kyouko]]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1905">'''Yamanba''' ({{lang|ja|山姥}}, lit. Mountain Hag), also known as '''Yamauba''', are the old hags and witches of the Japanese mountains and forests. A kind of [[wikipedia:Kijo_(folklore)|kijo]], Yamanba were once human but were corrupted and transformed into monsters. They usually appear as kind old ladies, who'll offer food, shelter, and a place to sleep to weary travelers, and they show no signs of their true evil nature until they attack. People who have survived encounters with these youkai often tell and pass along their tales, and these tales were often told as bedtime stories to disobedient children.

==Yamanba in Touhou==
Yamanba can be found on [[Youkai Mountain]] and unlike more social youkai like the [[Tengu]], they prefer living on their own instead of forming groups and societies. They barely interact with other Yamanba, but they can be seen interacting with other youkai (though they do it in a business-like manner). Unlike their folklore counterparts, Yamanba in Touhou tend to send lost adults back with a warning and raise lost children as one of their own. It's unknown as to why they do this.

==Yamajorou==
{{nihongo|'''Yamajorou'''|山女郎||"mountain mistress"}}&lt;ref name=jourou&gt;女郎/Jourou has various meanings, such as neutral variants of "girl", "lady", "woman", and also the profession of a prostitute. [https://nihonsi-jiten.com/yujyo-jyoro-oiran-chigai/ In terms of class, Jourou would be a middle ranking prostitute], higher than a 遊女/Yuujou/Whore, but lower than a 花魁/Oiran/high-class courtesan.&lt;/ref&gt; are a type of Yamanba who are less recluse than the others, although not much more is known about them.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5554">'''Yaoyorozu no Kami''' ({{lang|ja|八百万の神}}, ''Eight Million Gods'') are [[god]]s belonging to the Shinto religion. Although the term literally means eight million gods, this is not an exact figure—"eight million" here simply means "countlessly many". Gods can be both good and evil and have a wide range of personality and ideals. Shrines are also built for the deity as a place to occupy in order to interact with humans and other creatures.

==Yaoyorozu no Kami in Touhou==
Most of the gods that appear in the [[Touhou Project]] are part of the Yaoyorozu no Kami, though there are a few who belong to different religions.

Shinto Gods in the [[Touhou Project]] are "born" from and sustained by faith. Note that "born" can refer to ascension to godhood, as well, such as the case of [[Mizue no Uranoshimako]], who was a human that became a god even after his death, through faith. As they are born from human belief, they share some similarities to youkai, and sometimes have been referred as youkai.{{Reference needed|Citation for a time when a god has been referred to as a youkai needed.}} However, the two are significantly different, and for the most part can be considered two different "species". &lt;ref&gt;[[Silent Sinner in Blue]]: Chapter 17 — "You can't fight gods and youkai the same way."&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike gods, youkai were generally born from fear. Thus unlike youkai, gods do not do things such as attack humans by default, but instead seek out faith, typically in the form of worship.

Faith from either humans or youkai is valid, and is described a reverence towards existence, a fear of retribution for one's actions, and the will to enrich one's life, spirit, and body, but it doesn't really have to be that serious. Worship and faith can be as simple as just celebrating with your god. &lt;ref&gt;[[Mountain of Faith]]: [[Kanako Yasaka]]'s profile — "Actually, to play together was what gods wished for." "This was exactly the kind of faith Kanako was wishing for."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Mountain of Faith]]: Reimu A ending — "There's no difference between faith and the ability to share a nice drink together like this."&lt;/ref&gt;

Shinto gods may split their spirits and manifest where ever called on, thus enabling them to be in many places at once to serve their worshipers. Certain individuals, such as [[Watatsuki no Yorihime]] and shrine maidens like [[Reimu Hakurei]] and [[Sanae Kochiya]] can directly call upon the gods to enter their bodies. Most gods interact with the physical world entirely in this manner. However, there are some gods with a body, which allows them to act independently without being called upon, such as Kanako and Suwako (and likely [[Hina Kagiyama]], [[Minoriko Aki]], and [[Shizuha Aki]]). These gods may still split their spirit and be called upon as well.

The Shinto gods are well-acknowledged by denizens of Gensokyo and denizens of the [[Lunar Capital]] (of whom some may have actually been the original gods in Shinto Myth, such as [[Lord Tsukuyomi]] and his sister). However, in the [[outside world]], faith has instead been placed on various things such as friendship and news. &lt;ref&gt;[[Mountain of Faith]]: Reimu B Ending — "In the outside world, people's faith in gods was weakened by the appearance of bad cults and religions. However, all gods benefit from all faith in them. Even though faith and entreatment are different things. Humans, in their independence, lost the need for faith. Actually, that's not true. Even now, they have faith deep within their hearts. People believe in the news, brands, companies, and friends. The object of their faith has merely shifted closer. If you're a god who wishes to regain faith from humans... try setting your pride aside and being friendly with them."&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, like youkai, it is difficult for some gods such as [[Kanako Yasaka]] and [[Suwako Moriya]] to survive in the outside world as their faith dies out. Presumably more well-known Shinto gods such as Amaterasu still have plenty of faith to go around in the outside world, as there is nothing to indicate their existence is under threat any time soon.

Of note is that loss of faith for a god means a loss of their ability to manifest their power. However, to a god, this is the same as "death". &lt;ref&gt;[[Mountain of Faith]]: [[Sanae Kochiya]]'s profile — "When people lose faith in gods, the gods lose their power. They can't manifest their divine virtues. This is the same as death, for a god."&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1503">'''Yatagarasu''' ({{lang|ja|八咫烏}}, ''yatagarasu'') is a divine [[Wikipedia:Three-legged_crow|three-legged crow]]. In East Asian mythologies the three-legged crow is most often associated with the sun and in the Nihon Shoki, was the envoy of the highest sun [[god]], [[Wikipedia:Amaterasu|Amaterasu Oomikami]], who is the sister of [[Wikipedia:Tsukuyomi-no-Mikoto|Tsukuyomi no Mikoto]].

==Yatagarasu in Touhou==
In the [[Touhou Project]], the Yatagarasu was a deity that [[Kanako Yasaka]] persuaded [[Utsuho Reiuji]] into eating part of its spirit to gain its power. As Yatagarasu is the avatar of Amaterasu Oomikami, the sister of the founder of the moon capital, [[Lord Tsukuyomi|Tsukuyomi]] (along with [[Eirin Yagokoro]]), [[Watatsuki no Yorihime]] made a warning about the crow, although [[Watatsuki no Toyohime]] noted that it did not have the features of Yatagarasu.

The Yatagarasu is thought to have been a raven that lived in the sun; sunspots are said to be its form, visible to humans. The sun is a divine flame, thus the powers of the Yatagarasu will never burn out, and are thus difficult to control. As Utsuho is extremely dumb, she made the perfect vessel for channeling its power.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10574">{{nihongo|'''Youkai'''|妖怪||"mystic apparition" or "mysterious calamity"}} is a term used to refer to Japanese folk creatures and [[ghost]]s, or to supernatural beings in general. Because there are thousands of stories of magical beings around the world, the different types of youkai are endless.

The term ''youkai'' is sometimes used interchangeably with {{nihongo||お化け|obake|roughly "one that takes on a form"}}, meaning things which have undergone some kind of supernatural change, beings with shapeshifting powers, or [[phantom]]s and [[ghost]]s. It is a common Japanese belief that after a certain amount of time, ordinary objects and animals gain life and personality, becoming a kind of youkai. In some cases even a normal human can become a youkai under the right conditions.

==Youkai in Touhou==
The growth of rationalism and new explanations for strange phenomena has made it difficult for youkai to survive in the modern era - the valley of [[Gensokyo]], sealed off from the [[Outside World]] by the [[Great Hakurei Barrier]] in 1885, serves as one of their few sanctuaries. Some youkai, such as [[Mamizou Futatsuiwa]] and possibly [[Shou Toramaru]], have managed to survive in the outside world for many years, although both have since moved to Gensokyo for unrelated reasons. [[Yukari Yakumo]] is speculated by some residents of Gensokyo to be a youkai of the outside world who merely comes to Gensokyo to play, but this is just one of many rumors about her.

Since Gensokyo's [[human]] population is relatively small, but youkai are dependent on conflict with humans in order to survive, its inhabitants have developed a number of unique rules and customs. Among other things youkai are forbidden from killing natives of the [[Human Village]] (but not humans from the [[Outside World]], even if they find themselves in Gensokyo), and inhabitants of the Human Village are forbidden from turning themselves into youkai&lt;ref&gt;''[[Forbidden Scrollery]]'' chapter 25&lt;/ref&gt;. More recently the [[Spell Card]] rules were created as a system of formal duels which de-emphasize raw power, limiting the damage that can be caused by youkai and making it easier for humans to resolve youkai [[incident]]s. While [[Reimu Hakurei|the Hakurei shrine maiden]] is officially in charge of exterminating youkai whenever they cause trouble, these "exterminations" (along with those of her colleagues) are usually nonlethal, with sealing or execution reserved only for youkai that cannot abide by the rules.

===Physiology===
Youkai are primarily spiritual beings rather than physical ones. As such they are more vulnerable to faith-based attacks (such as charms, wards, etc.) than to physical injuries and ailments; it's said a youkai can even recover from being cut into pieces, if the damage has insufficient "meaning" behind it. Some youkai, such as [[magician]]s, have bodies more similar to [[human]]s and may lack this ability.

Related to this, most youkai keep their promises once given. While a human who loses a [[Spell Card]] duel can immediately challenge the winner to another, youkai rarely do so. 

Many youkai are stronger and longer-lived than humans, with lifespans reaching into hundreds of years or more. Marisa claims that [[Rinnosuke Morichika]], who is only [[half-youkai]], has not visibly aged since she was a child. Unlike [[Fairy|fairies]], however, they are not immortal.

All youkai have an innate connection to the [[Moon]]&lt;ref&gt;''[[Eastern and Little Nature Deity]]'': [[Fairy of the Moon]]&lt;/ref&gt; - according to [[Yukari Yakumo]] it was the moon's dim light which gave birth to the youkai by causing humanity to fear and create legends about them,&lt;ref&gt;[[Cage in Lunatic Runagate/Fifth Chapter|''Cage in Lunatic Runagate'': Fifth Chapter.]] "Under the dim light of the [[moon]], all sorts of things blanket the Earth in shadows, such as grasses, trees, mountains, rocks and buildings. With light as weak as moonlight, it is impossible to eliminate these shadows. And they are the birthplace of humanity's fears, sometimes creating legends of youkai. In a manner of speaking, the moon gave birth to all youkai."&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Kaguya Houraisan]] claims that some earthlings were turned into monsters by [[Lunarian]]'s to regulate the earth's [[Impurity|"filth"]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Imperishable Night/Story/Scarlet Team's Scenario 2|''Imperishable Night'': Scarlet Team's Scenario]]. "The moon gave many powers to beings of the earth. Many of them, such as magic, were originally the moon's power." "We of the moon turned some on the Earth to monsters, to regulate their filthiness..." Although "monster" uses different Japanese characters than what's used for "youkai", Kaguya's latter statement appears to be referring to youkai, as she then comments about how the humans sealed them away (Gensokyo's creation and/or the myriad of other ways that humanity sealed or lost the fear of the youkai).&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time many of Gensokyo's youkai have come to take on human traits and vice versa. Youkai with human-like bodies and/or personalities have become far more common, even among normally monstrous species. However, even the most human-like youkai would still be considered strange by human standards.

===Relations with ordinary humans===
Some humanoid youkai live harmoniously with ordinary humans, especially those who frequent the Human Village. However, there are exceptions, and these youkai build up the tension between the humans and youkai. Youkai typically need humans' fear to live, which range from friendly surprises to assault threats.

===Society===
[[Gensokyo]] youkai tend to live within the wilderness, far away from [[human]] settlements. Most youkai are notoriously self-centered and do not travel in groups, but a number of factions exist.

The [[tengu]] and [[kappa]] have a complex society which lays claim to the upper parts of [[Youkai Mountain]] and guards its borders jealously, though it is described by as [[Ran Yakumo]] as simply a half-hearted attempt to mimic the [[Outside World]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Silent Sinner in Blue]]'' Chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt; This society was once led by [[oni]] before they migrated to the [[Underworld]]. The tengu later formed an alliance with the gods of [[Moriya Shrine]] after it was transported to Gensokyo.

The inhabitants of the [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]] have been described as living a lifestyle completely different from both youkai and humans.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Perfect Memento in Strict Sense]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[Hakugyokurou]] lies within the [[Netherworld]] rather than Gensokyo, travel between the two has become easier in recent years and it is frequently counted among Gensokyo's power blocs.

Various "hated" species of youkai such as [[satori (Species)|satori]], [[tsuchigumo]], and [[oni]] are found in the [[Underworld]]. A treaty with Gensokyo forbids surface youkai from travelling to the Underworld, in exchange for the Underworld youkai agreeing to contain [[evil spirit]]s left over from the [[Former Hell|regions that were once part of Hell]]. Underworld youkai, however, are free to travel to Gensokyo.

The recently-founded [[Myouren Temple]] preaches an unusual brand of [[Buddhism]] which is friendly to youkai, though many of its regulars are drawn to it for non-religious reasons.

Since her arrival in Gensokyo, [[Mamizou Futatsuiwa]] has gathered large numbers of [[tanuki]] and [[tsukumogami]] to her side.

While she does not hold any position of authority, [[Yukari Yakumo]] has negotiated many deals and projects including the [[Great Hakurei Barrier]], and arguably has the most influence of any independent youkai.

===[[wikipedia:Parallel evolution|Parallel Evolution]]===
In [[Curiosities of Lotus Asia/Chapter_18|''Curiosities of Lotus Asia'' Chapter 18]], [[Rinnosuke Morichika]] mentions that the [[Kappa]] are often mistaken to be related to the Chinese river youkai/[[god]] known as a Kahaku. He tells [[Sakuya Izayoi]] that while they may have similar names (And presumably similar in many other ways to the point of being identical), they are two completely different creatures. He states that just because there’s a youkai with a similar name in a country in the outside world, to think that they are the same creature is unreasonable.

This is known in science as parallel evolution. This may also be the case of why [[Oni]] and [[Vampire]]s share portions of their name and have identical weaknesses, while they are clearly two different species of youkai. Because modern science is fairly new, similar supernatural creatures may easily be grouped up as the same thing.

==Youkai in Seihou==
It's never been explicitly stated in the ''[[Seihou Project]]'' if Youkai do exist in the [[Seihou World|world of Seihou]]. However,  there are various possible candidates that could be considered to be in this bestiary because of their unusual characteristics in the series, such as: [[Muse]] (because she stylises in magic and may either be a [[god]], [[devil]] or [[vampire]]), [[Yuitia]] (because she's a [[phantom]]), [[Vivit (Erich's Daughter)|Vivit]] and [[Icarus]]. Although she's a ''[[Touhou Project]]'' character,  [[Yuuka Kazami]] is the only character to be stated as a youkai within the series.

It is said in some legends to be the spirit of an individual who has perished in the snow and cold. Yuki-onna are often described wearing a white kimono (or any clothes resembling such), or naked, with only their hair and face standing out. Despite their inhuman beauty, they are hostile to [[human]]s and kill them unsuspectingly.

Inhabiting households, they are thought to bring good fortune to their residence and the family occupying it, and bad fortune should they leave. They must be cared for and raised properly and evenly, as one would a child, lest they be driven away. As a child-like youkai, they are prone to causing harmless mischief around the house, and typically have the appearance of a child in a kimono, with bobbed hair.

==Zashiki-warashi in Touhou==
In ''[[Wild and Horned Hermit]]'', many of the [[Human Village]]'s zashiki-warashi leave for the [[Outside World]] due to heavy demand, but soon return when they learn that the work there is part-time only and there's no real need for zashiki-warashi. While they're gone, [[Yukari Yakumo]] brings in foreign household spirits to replace them: [[hobgoblin]]s.

Though they serve humans, Yukari reveals they are actually spies for youkai, with the purpose of watching over the Human Village, and later infiltrating the outside.

==Relationships==
;[[Okina Matara]]
During Lotus Eater, several Zashiki-Warashi in the Human village went to Okina Matara so they could perform 'remote work' from the [[Land of the Backdoor]]. According to one of them, 
Zashiki-Warashi need to periodically change their place of residence in order to 'cultivate their power', and that they can monitor their households just as well from the [[Land of the Backdoor]], as it can 'connect' to anywhere as long as there is a door that nobody is watching.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1380">{{nihongo|'''Zombies'''|ゾンビ|zonbi}} are reanimated corpses usually resurrected by a practitioner. They are often portrayed as dangerous and unnatural even among other supernatural creatures. The stereotypical method of how zombies multiply is being bitten by one or an organism who devoured a piece of a subdued zombie. In science fiction, zombies are often the result of a man-made virus, disease, or parasite.

==Sub-species==
===Jiang Shi===
:''Main article: [[Jiang Shi]]''
'''Jiang shi''' ({{nihongo|キョンシー}}, ''kyonshii'') are zombies from Chinese folklore that move around by hopping with the arms outstretched.

==Zombies in Touhou==
The term zombie is used in [[Yoshika Miyako]]'s profile in [[Ten Desires]] and used to describe herself in each scenario. Unlike the jiang shi from Chinese folklore, the Touhou version is much like the Western zombie. Unlike other undead/non-living creatures like [[ghost|ghosts]], zombies do not exist because they have an attachment to this world but rather to serve the one who resurrected them (Or because they are forcefully transformed by another zombie).
